<DIV style="position:absolute;top:344;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft2440">Mindfulness (<i>sati</i>) itself is recollection (<i>anussati</i>) because it arises again and</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:361;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft24410">again; or alternatively, the mindfulness (<i>sati</i>) that is proper (<i>anurūpa</i>) for a<br>clansman gone forth out of faith, since it occurs only in those instances where it<br>should occur, is “recollection” (<i>anussati</i>).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:547;left:15"><nobr><span class="ft2448">The word&nbsp;<i>dhamma—</i>perhaps the most important and frequently used of Pali</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:563;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft24411">words—has no single equivalent in English because no English word has both a<br>generalization so wide and loose as the word&nbsp;<i>dhamma</i>&nbsp;in its widest sense (which<br>includes “everything” that can be known or thought of in any way) and at&nbsp;the same<br>time an ability to be, as it were, focused in a set of well-defined specific uses. Roughly<br><i>dhamma</i>&nbsp;= what-can-be-remembered or what-can-be-borne-in-mind (<i>dhāretabba</i>) as<br><i>kamma</i>&nbsp;= what-can-be-done (<i>kātabba</i>). The following two principal (and overlapping)<br>senses are involved here: (i) the Law as taught, and (ii) objects of consciousness. (i) In<br>the first case the word has either been left untranslated as “Dhamma” or “dhamma”<br>or it has been tendered as “Law” or “law.” This ranges from the loose sense of the<br>“Good Law,” “cosmic law,” and “teaching” to such specific technical senses as the<br>“discrimination of law,” “causality,” “being subject to or having the nature of.” (ii) In<br>the second case the word in its looser sense of “something known or thought of” has<br>either been left untranslated as “dhamma” or rendered by&nbsp;“state” (more rarely by<br>“thing” or “phenomenon”), while in its technical sense as one of the twelve bases or<br>eighteen elements “mental object” and “mental datum” have&nbsp;been used. The sometimes<br>indiscriminate use of “dhamma,” “state” and “law” in both the looser senses is<br>deliberate.&nbsp;The English words have&nbsp;been reserved as far as possible for rendering<br><i>dhamma</i>&nbsp;(except that “state” has sometimes been used to render&nbsp;<i>bhāva</i>, etc., in the<br>sense of “-ness”). Other subsidiary meanings of a non-technical nature have<br>occasionally been otherwise rendered according to context.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:556;left:18"><nobr><span class="ft2453">In order to avoid muddle it is necessary to distinguish renderings of the word</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:572;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft2457"><i>dhamma</i>&nbsp;and renderings of the words used to define it. The word itself is a gerundive<br>of the verb&nbsp;<i>dharati&nbsp;</i>(caus.&nbsp;<i>dhāreti—</i>“to bear”) and so is the literal equivalent of “[quality]<br>that is to be borne.” But since the grammatical meanings of the two words&nbsp;<i>dharati</i>&nbsp;(“to<br>bear”) and&nbsp;<i>dahati&nbsp;</i>(“to put or sort out,” whence&nbsp;<i>dhātu—</i>“element”) sometimes coalesce,<br>it often comes very close to&nbsp;<i>dhātu</i>&nbsp;(but see VIII n. 68 and XI.104). If it is asked, what<br>bears the qualities to be borne? A correct answer here would probably be that it is the<br>event (<i>samaya</i>), as stated in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī (§1, etc.), in which the various<br>dhammas listed there arise and are present, variously related to each other. The word<br><i>dhammin</i>&nbsp;(thing qualified or “bearer of what&nbsp;is to be borne”) is a late introduction as a<br>logical term (perhaps first used in Pali by&nbsp;Vism-mhṭ, see p.&nbsp;534).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:734;left:18"><nobr><span class="ft2453">As to the definitions of the word, there are several. At&nbsp;D-a I 99 four meanings are</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:750;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft2458">given: moral (meritorious) special quality (<i>guṇa</i>), preaching of the Law (<i>desanā</i>), scripture<br>(<i>pariyatti</i>), and “no-living-being-ness” (<i>nissattatā</i>). Four meanings are also given at<br>Dhs-a 38: scripture (<i>pariyatti</i>), cause (of effect) as law (<i>hetu</i>), moral (meritorious)<br>special quality (<i>guṇa</i>), and “no-living-being-ness and soullessness” (<i>nissatta-nijjīvatā</i>).<br>A wider definition is given at&nbsp;M-a I 17, where the following meanings are distinguished:<br>scriptural mastery, (<i>pariyatti—</i>A III 86) truth, (<i>sacca—</i>Vin I 12) concentration, (<i>samādhi—<br></i>D II 54) understanding, (<i>paññā—</i>J-a I 280) nature, (<i>pakati—</i>M I 162) individual essence,<br>(<i>sabhāva—</i>Dhs 1) voidness, (<i>suññatā—</i>Dhs 25) merit, (<i>puñña—</i>S I 82) offence, (<i>āpatti—<br></i>Vin III 187) what&nbsp;is knowable,&nbsp;(<i>ñeyya—</i>Paṭis II 194) “<i>and so on</i>” (see also VIII n. 68).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:218;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft2525">Blessed One’s knowledge: and if his unobstructed knowledge did not have&nbsp;all dhammas<br>as its object, there would be presence of obstruction where it did not occur, and so it<br>would not be unobstructed.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:267;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft2523">“Or alternatively, even if we&nbsp;suppose that they are different, still it is omniscient</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:283;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft2525">knowledge itself that is intended as ‘unhindered’ since it is that&nbsp;which occurs<br>unhindered universally. And it is by&nbsp;his attainment of that that the Blessed One is<br>known as Omniscient, All-seer, Fully Enlightened, not because of awareness (<i>avabodha</i>)<br>of every dhamma at&nbsp;once,&nbsp;simultaneously (see M II 127). And it is said accordingly in<br>the Paṭisambhidā: ‘This is a name derived from the final liberation of the Enlightened<br>Ones, the Blessed Ones, together with the acquisition of omniscient knowledge at&nbsp;the<br>root of the Enlightenment Tree; this name “Buddha” is a designation based on<br>realization’ (Paṭis I 174). For the ability in the Blessed One’s continuity to penetrate all<br>dhammas without exception was due to his having completely attained to knowledge<br>capable of becoming aware of all dhammas.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:445;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft2523">“Here it may be asked: But how then? When this knowledge occurs, does it do so</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:461;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft2525">with respect to every field simultaneously, or successively? For firstly, if it occurs<br>simultaneously with respect to every objective&nbsp;field, then with the simultaneous<br>appearance of formed dhammas classed as past, future and present, internal and<br>external, etc., and of unformed and conventional (conceptual) dhammas, there would<br>be no awareness of contrast (<i>paṭibhāga</i>), as happens in one who looks at&nbsp;a painted<br>canvas from a distance. That being so, it follows that all dhammas become the objective<br>field of the Blessed One’s knowledge in an undifferentiated form (<i>anirūpita-rūpana</i>),<br>as they do through the aspect of not-self to those who are exercising insight thus ’All<br>dhammas are not-self’ (Dhp 279; Th 678; M I 230; II 64; S III 132; A I 286; IV 14; Paṭis II<br>48, 62; Vin I 86. Cf. also A III 444; IV 88, 338; Sn 1076). And those do not escape this<br>difficulty who say that the Enlightened One’s knowledge occurs with the characteristic<br>of presence of all knowable dhammas as its objective&nbsp;field, devoid of discriminative<br>thinking (<i>vikappa-rahita</i>), and universal in time (<i>sabba-kāla</i>) and that is why they are<br>called ’All-seeing’ and why it is said, ’The Nāga is concentrated walking and he is<br>concentrated standing’ (?).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:704;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft2523">They do not escape the difficulty since the Blessed One’s knowledge would then</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:720;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft2525">have&nbsp;only a partial objective&nbsp;field, because, by&nbsp;having the characteristic of presence as<br>its object, past, future and conventional dhammas, which lack that characteristic, would<br>be absent. So it is wrong to say that it occurs simultaneously with respect to every<br>objective&nbsp;field. Then secondly, if we&nbsp;say that it occurs successively with respect to<br>every objective&nbsp;field, that is wrong too. For when the knowable,&nbsp;classed in the many<br>different ways according to birth, place,&nbsp;individual essence, etc., and direction, place,<br>time, etc., is apprehended successively, then penetration without remainder is not<br>effected since the knowable is infinite. And those are wrong too who say that the<br>Blessed One is All-seeing owing to his doing his defining by&nbsp;taking one part of the<br>knowable as that actually experienced (<i>paccakkha</i>) and deciding that the rest is the<br>same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning, and that such knowledge is not</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft2520">Herein, as to [<i>clear</i>]&nbsp;<i>vision</i>: there are three kinds of clear vision and eight kinds</span></nobr></DIV>

The three kinds should be understood as stated in the<br>Bhayabherava Sutta (M I 22f.), and the eight kinds as stated in the Ambaṭṭha<br>Sutta (D I 100). For there eight kinds of clear vision are stated, made up of the six<br>kinds of direct-knowledge together with insight and the supernormal power of<br>the mind-made [body].</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:380;left:18"><nobr><span class="ft2533">“All that is no argument.—Why not?—Because this is not a field for ratiocination;</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:396;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft2536">for the Blessed One has said this: ‘The objective&nbsp;field of Enlightened Ones is<br>unthinkable, it cannot be thought out; anyone who tried to think it out would reap<br>madness and frustration’ (A II 80). The agreed explanation here is this: Whatever the<br>Blessed One wants to know—either entirely or partially—there his knowledge occurs<br>as actual experience because it does so without hindrance. And it has constant<br>concentration because of the absence of distraction. And it cannot occur in association<br>with wishing of a kind that is due to absence from the objective&nbsp;field of something that<br>he wants to know.&nbsp;There can be no exception to this because of the words, ‘All dhammas<br>are &nbsp;available to the adverting of the Enlightened One, the Blessed &nbsp;One, are available at<br>his wish, are available to his attention, are available to his thought’ (Paṭis II 195). And<br>the Blessed One’s knowledge that has the past and future as its objective&nbsp;field is<br>entirely actual experience since it is devoid of assumption based on inference, tradition<br>or conjecture.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:607;left:18"><nobr><span class="ft2533">“And yet, even in that case, suppose he wanted to know the whole in its entirety,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:623;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft2536">then would his knowledge not occur without differentiation in the whole objective<br>field simultaneously? And so there would still be no getting out of that difficulty?<br>“That is not so, because of its purifiedness. Because the Enlightened One’s objective<br>field is purified and it is unthinkable. Otherwise there would be no unthinkableness in<br>the knowledge of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, if it occurred in the same way<br>as that of ordinary people. So, although it occurs with all dhammas as its object, it<br>nevertheless does so making those dhammas quite clearly defined, as though it had<br>a single dhamma as its object. This is what&nbsp;is unthinkable here. ‘</span></nobr></DIV>

So he is Fully Enlightened because he has rightly and<br>by&nbsp;himself discovered all dhammas together and separately, simultaneously and<br>successively, according to his wish’ (Vism-mhṭ 190–91).<br>8.</span></nobr></DIV>

Just as one who brings a caravan home gets<br>caravans across a wilderness, gets them across a robber-infested wilderness,<br>gets them across a wild-beast-infested wilderness, gets them across a foodless<br>wilderness, gets them across a waterless wilderness, gets them right across, gets<br>them quite across, gets them properly across, gets them to reach a land of safety,<br>so too the Blessed One is a caravan leader, one who brings home the caravans,&nbsp;he<br>gets them across a wilderness, gets them across the wilderness of birth” (Nidd<br>I 446).</span></nobr></DIV>

For when animals can, through<br>listening to the Blessed One’s Dhamma, acquire the benefit of a [suitable rebirth<br>as] support [for progress], and with the benefit of that same support they come,<br>in their second or third rebirth, to partake of the path and its fruition.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:585;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft2613">51.&nbsp;Maṇḍūka, the deity’s son, and others illustrate this.

[209] A cowherd who was standing leaning on a stick put<br>his stick on the frog’s head and crushed it. He died and was straight away<br>reborn in a gilded, divine palace, twelve leagues broad in the realm of the Thirty-<br>three (<i>Tāvatiṃsa</i>). He found himself there, as if waking up from sleep, amidst a<br>host of celestial nymphs, and he exclaimed, “So I have&nbsp;actually been reborn here.<br>What deed did I do?” When he sought for the reason, he found it was none other<br>than his apprehension of the sign in the Blessed One’s voice. He went with his<br>divine palace at&nbsp;once to the Blessed One and paid homage at&nbsp;his feet. Though<br>the Blessed One knew about it, he asked him:</span></nobr></DIV>

When<br>he is blissful, his mind, with the Enlightened One’s special qualities for its<br>object, becomes concentrated, and so the jhāna factors eventually arise in a<br>single moment. But owing to the profundity of the Enlightened One’s special<br>qualities, or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of<br>many sorts, the jhāna is only access and does not reach absorption. And that<br>access jhāna itself is known as “recollection of the Buddha” too, because it<br>arises with the recollection of the Enlightened One’s special qualities as the<br>means.</span></nobr></DIV>

He comes to feel as if he were<br>living in the Master’s presence. And his body, when the recollection of the<br>Buddha’s special qualities dwells in it, becomes as worthy of veneration as a<br>shrine room. His mind tends toward the plane of the Buddhas.

When greed has been<br>abandoned, he neither thinks for his own affliction, nor thinks for others’<br>affliction, nor thinks for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental<br>suffering and grief.

This applies to the [above-mentioned eight]<br>formed supramundane states (dhammas).&nbsp;But the unformed [dhamma] is worth<br>inducing&nbsp;<i>by</i>&nbsp;one’s own mind [to become the mind’s object], thus it is “onward-<br>leading,” too; the meaning is that it is worth treating as one’s shelter by<br>realizing it.</span></nobr></DIV>
