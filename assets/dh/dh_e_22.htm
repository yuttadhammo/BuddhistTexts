    <ol class="verse">
      <li>
        The liar goes to the state of woe;<br/>
        also he who, having done (wrong), says,<br/>
        "I did not do it."<br/>
        Men of base actions both,<br/>
        on departing they share the same destiny<br/>
        in the other world.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are many evil characters<br/>
        and uncontrolled men<br/>
        wearing the saffron robe.<br/>
        These wicked men<br/>
        will be born in states of woe<br/>
        because of their evil deeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        It would be better<br/>
        to swallow a red-hot iron ball,<br/>
        blazing like fire,<br/>
        than as an immoral and uncontrolled monk<br/>
        to eat the alms of the people.
      </li>
      <li>
        Four misfortunes befall the reckless man<br/>
        who consorts with another's wife:<br/>
        acquisition of demerit,<br/>
        disturbed sleep,<br/>
        ill-repute,<br/>
        and (rebirth in) states of woe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Such a man acquires demerit<br/>
        and an unhappy birth in the future.<br/>
        Brief is the pleasure<br/>
        of the frightened man and woman,<br/>
        and the king imposes heavy punishment.<br/>
        Hence, let no man consort with another's wife.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as kusa grass wrongly handled cuts the hand,<br/>
        even so, a recluse's life wrongly lived<br/>
        drags one to states of woe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any loose act,<br/>
        any corrupt observance,<br/>
        any life of questionable celibacy —<br/>
        none of these bear much fruit.
      </li>
      <li>
        If anything is to be done,<br/>
        let one do it with sustained vigor.<br/>
        A lax monastic life<br/>
        stirs up the dust of passions all the more.
      </li>
      <li>
        An evil deed is better left undone,<br/>
        for such a deed torments one afterwards.<br/>
        But a good deed is better done,<br/>
        doing which one repents not later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as a border city is closely guarded<br/>
        both within and without, even so, guard yourself.<br/>
        Do not let slip this opportunity (for spiritual growth).<br/>
        For those who let slip this opportunity<br/>
        grieve indeed when consigned to hell.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those who are ashamed<br/>
        of what they should not be ashamed of,<br/>
        and are not ashamed<br/>
        of what they should be ashamed of —<br/>
        upholding false views,<br/>
        they go to states of woe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those who see something to fear<br/>
        where there is nothing to fear,<br/>
        and see nothing to fear<br/>
        where there is something to fear —<br/>
        upholding false views,<br/>
        they go to states of woe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those who imagine evil<br/>
        where there is none,<br/>
        and do not see evil where it is —<br/>
        upholding false views,<br/>
        they go to states of woe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those who discern<br/>
        the wrong as wrong<br/>
        and the right as right —<br/>
        upholding right views,<br/>
        they go to realms of bliss.
      </li>
