    <ol class="verse">
      <li>
        The craving of one<br/>
        given to heedless living<br/>
        grows like a creeper.<br/>
        Like the monkey<br/>
        seeking fruits in the forest,<br/>
        he leaps from life to life<br/>
        (tasting the fruit of his kamma).
      </li>
      <li>
        Whoever is overcome<br/>
        by this wretched and sticky craving,<br/>
        his sorrows grow<br/>
        like grass after the rains.<br/>
      </li>
      <li>
        But whoever overcomes<br/>
        this wretched craving,<br/>
        so difficult to overcome,<br/>
        from him sorrows fall away<br/>
        like water from a lotus leaf.
      </li>
      <li>
        This I say to you:<br/>
        Good luck to all assembled here!<br/>
        Dig up the root of craving,<br/>
        like one in search<br/>
        of the fragrant root of the birana grass.<br/>
        Let not Mara crush you again and again,<br/>
        as a flood crushes a reed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as a tree,<br/>
        though cut down, sprouts up again<br/>
        if its roots remain uncut and firm,<br/>
        even so, until the craving<br/>
        that lies dormant is rooted out,<br/>
        suffering springs up again and again.
      </li>
      <li>
        The misguided man in whom<br/>
        the thirty-six currents of craving<br/>
        strongly rush toward pleasurable objects,<br/>
        is swept away by the flood<br/>
        of his passionate thoughts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Everywhere these currents flow,<br/>
        and the creeper (of craving) sprouts and grows.<br/>
        Seeing that the creeper has sprung up,<br/>
        cut off its root with wisdom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flowing in (from all objects)<br/>
        and watered by craving,<br/>
        feelings of pleasure arise in beings.<br/>
        Bent on pleasures and seeking enjoyment,<br/>
        these men fall prey to birth and decay.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beset by craving, people run about<br/>
        like an entrapped hare.<br/>
        Held fast by mental fetters,<br/>
        they come to suffering<br/>
        again and again for a long time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beset by craving, people run about<br/>
        like an entrapped hare.<br/>
        Therefore, one who yearns to be passion-free<br/>
        should destroy his own craving.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is one who, turning away from desire<br/>
        (for household life)<br/>
        takes to the life of the forest (of a monk).<br/>
        But after being freed from the household,<br/>
        he runs back to it.<br/>
        Behold that man! Though freed,<br/>
        he runs back to that very bondage!
      </li>
      <li>
        That is not a strong fetter, the wise say,<br/>
        which is made of iron, wood or hemp.<br/>
        But the infatuation and longing<br/>
        for jewels and ornaments,<br/>
        children and wives —<br/>
        that, they say, is a far stronger fetter,<br/>
        which pulls one downward and,<br/>
        though seemingly loose, is hard to remove.<br/>
        This, too, the wise cut off.<br/>
        Giving up sensual pleasure,<br/>
        and without any longing,<br/>
        they renounce the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those who are lust-infatuated fall back<br/>
        into the swirling current (of samsara)<br/>
        like a spider on its self-spun web.<br/>
        This, too, the wise cut off.<br/>
        Without any longing,<br/>
        they abandon all suffering<br/>
        and renounce the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let go of the past,<br/>
        let go of the future,<br/>
        let go of the present,<br/>
        and cross over<br/>
        to the farther shore of existence.<br/>
        With mind wholly liberated,<br/>
        you shall come no more to birth and death.
      </li>
      <li>
        For a person tormented by evil thoughts,<br/>
        who is passion-dominated<br/>
        and given to the pursuit of pleasure,<br/>
        his craving steadily grows.<br/>
        He makes the fetter strong, indeed.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who delights in subduing evil thoughts,<br/>
        who meditates on the impurities<br/>
        and is ever mindful —<br/>
        it is he who will make an end of craving<br/>
        and rend asunder Mara's fetter.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who has reached the goal, is fearless,<br/>
        free from craving, passionless,<br/>
        and has plucked out the thorns of existence —<br/>
        for him this is the last body.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who is free from craving and attachment,<br/>
        is perfect in uncovering<br/>
        the true meaning of the Teaching,<br/>
        and knows the arrangement of the sacred texts<br/>
        in correct sequence —<br/>
        he, indeed, is the bearer of his final body.<br/>
        He is truly called the profoundly wise one,<br/>
        the great man.
      </li>
      <li>
        A victor am I over all, all have I known.<br/>
        Yet unattached am I to all<br/>
        that is conquered and known.<br/>
        Abandoning all, I am freed<br/>
        through the destruction of craving.<br/>
        Having thus directly comprehended all by myself,<br/>
        whom shall I call my teacher?
      </li>
      <li>
        The gift of Dhamma excels all gifts;<br/>
        the taste of the Dhamma excels all tastes;<br/>
        the delight in Dhamma excels all delights.<br/>
        The Craving-Freed vanquishes all suffering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Riches ruin only the foolish,<br/>
        not those in quest of the Beyond.<br/>
        By craving for riches<br/>
        the witless man ruins himself<br/>
        as well as others.
      </li>
      <li>
        Weeds are the bane of fields,<br/>
        lust is the bane of mankind.<br/>
        Therefore, what is offered<br/>
        to those free of lust<br/>
        yields abundant fruit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Weeds are the bane of fields,<br/>
        hatred is the bane of mankind.<br/>
        Therefore, what is offered<br/>
        to those free of hatred<br/>
        yields abundant fruit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Weeds are the bane of fields,<br/>
        delusion is the bane of mankind.<br/>
        Therefore, what is offered<br/>
        to those free of delusion<br/>
        yields abundant fruit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Weeds are the bane of fields,<br/>
        desire is the bane of mankind.<br/>
        Therefore, what is offered<br/>
        to those free of desire<br/>
        yields abundant fruit.
      </li>
