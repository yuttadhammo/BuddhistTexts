     <li>
      Who shall overcome this earth,<br/>
      this realm of Yama<br/>
      and this sphere of men and gods?<br/>
      Who shall bring to perfection<br/>
      the well-taught path of wisdom<br/>
      as an expert garland-maker<br/>
      would his floral design?
    </li>
    <li>
      A striver-on-the path<br/>
      shall overcome this earth,<br/>
      this realm of Yama<br/>
      and this sphere of men and gods.<br/>
      The striver-on-the-path<br/>
      shall bring to perfection<br/>
      the well-taught path of wisdom,<br/>
      as an expert garland-maker<br/>
      would his floral design.
    </li>
    <li>
      Realizing that this body is like froth,<br/>
      penetrating its mirage-like nature,<br/>
      and plucking out Mara's flower-tipped arrows of sensuality,<br/>
      go beyond sight of the King of Death!
    </li>
    <li>
      As a mighty flood sweeps away the sleeping village,<br/>
      so death carries away the person of distracted mind<br/>
      who only plucks the flowers (of pleasure).
    </li>
    <li>
      The Destroyer brings under his sway<br/>
      the person of distracted mind who,<br/>
      insatiate in sense desires,<br/>
      only plucks the flowers (of pleasure).
    </li>
    <li>
      As a bee gathers honey from the flower<br/>
      without injuring its color or fragrance,<br/>
      even so the sage goes on his alms-round in the village.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let none find fault with others;<br/>
      let none see the omissions and commissions of others.<br/>
      But let one see one's own acts,<br/>
      done and undone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Like a beautiful flower<br/>
      full of color but without fragrance,<br/>
      even so, fruitless are the fair words<br/>
      of one who does not practice them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Like a beautiful flower<br/>
      full of color and also fragrant,<br/>
      even so, fruitful are the fair words<br/>
      of one who practices them.
    </li>
    <li>
      As from a great heap of flowers<br/>
      many garlands can be made,<br/>
      even so should many good deeds<br/>
      be done by one born a mortal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Not the sweet smell of flowers,<br/>
      not even the fragrance of sandal, tagara, or jasmine<br/>
      blows against the wind.<br/>
      But the fragrance of the virtuous<br/>
      blows against the wind.<br/>
      Truly the virtuous man pervades all directions<br/>
      with the fragrance of his virtue.
    </li>
    <li>
      Of all the fragrances —<br/>
      sandal, tagara, blue lotus and jasmine —<br/>
      the fragrance of virtue is the sweetest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Faint is the fragrance of tagara and sandal,<br/>
      but excellent is the fragrance of the virtuous,<br/>
      wafting even amongst the gods.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mara never finds the path of the truly virtuous,<br/>
      who abide in heedfulness<br/>
      and are freed by perfect knowledge.
    </li>
    <li>
      Upon a heap of rubbish in the road-side ditch<br/>
      blooms a lotus,<br/>
      fragrant and pleasing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Even so, on the rubbish heap of blinded mortals<br/>
      the disciple of the Supremely Enlightened One shines<br/>
      resplendent in wisdom.
    </li>
