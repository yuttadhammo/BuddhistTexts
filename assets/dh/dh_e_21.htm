        If by renouncing a lesser happiness<br/>
        one may realize a greater happiness,<br/>
        let the wise man renounce the lesser,<br/>
        having regard for the greater.
      </li>
      <li>
        Entangled by the bonds of hate,<br/>
        he who seeks his own happiness<br/>
        by inflicting pain on others,<br/>
        is never delivered from hatred.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cankers only increase<br/>
        for those who are arrogant and heedless,<br/>
        who leave undone what should be done<br/>
        and do what should not be done.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cankers cease for those mindful<br/>
        and clearly comprehending ones<br/>
        who always earnestly practice<br/>
        mindfulness of the body,<br/>
        who do not resort<br/>
        to what should not be done,<br/>
        and steadfastly pursue what should be done.

        Having slain mother (craving),<br/>
        father (self-conceit),<br/>
        two warrior-kings (eternalism and nihilism),<br/>
        and destroyed a country<br/>
        (sense organs and sense objects)<br/>
        together with its treasurer<br/>
        (attachment and lust),<br/>
        ungrieving goes the holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        Having slain mother, father,<br/>
        two brahman kings (two extreme views),<br/>
        and a tiger as the fifth<br/>
        (the five mental hindrances),<br/>
        ungrieving goes the holy man.

        Those disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily<br/>
        who day and night constantly practice<br/>
        the Recollection of the Qualities of the Buddha.

      <li>
        Difficult is life as a monk;<br/>
        difficult is it to delight therein.<br/>
        Also difficult and sorrowful<br/>
        is the household life.<br/>
        Suffering comes from association with unequals;<br/>
        suffering comes from wandering in samsara.<br/>
        Therefore, be not an aimless wanderer,<br/>
        be not a pursuer of suffering.

      <li>
        He who is full of faith and virtue,<br/>
        and possesses good repute and wealth â€”<br/>
        he is respected everywhere,<br/>
        in whatever land he travels.
      </li>
      <li>
        The good shine from afar,<br/>
        like the Himalaya mountains.<br/>
        But the wicked are unseen,<br/>
        like arrows shot in the night.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who sits alone,<br/>
        sleeps alone,<br/>
        and walks alone,<br/>
        who is strenuous<br/>
        and subdues himself alone,<br/>
        will find delight<br/>
        in the solitude of the forest.
