   <ol class="verse">
     <li>
      Should one find a man<br/>
      who points out faults and who reproves,<br/>
      let him follow such a wise and sagacious person<br/>
      as one would a guide to hidden treasure.<br/>
      It is always better, and never worse,<br/>
      to cultivate such an association.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let him admonish,<br/>
      instruct and shield one from wrong;<br/>
      he, indeed, is dear to the good<br/>
      and detestable to the evil.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do not associate with evil companions;<br/>
      do not seek the fellowship of the vile.<br/>
      Associate with the good friends;<br/>
      seek the fellowship of noble men.
    </li>
    <li>
      He who drinks deep the Dhamma<br/>
      lives happily with a tranquil mind.<br/>
      The wise man ever delights in the Dhamma<br/>
      made known by the Noble One (the Buddha).
    </li>
    <li>
      Irrigators regulate the rivers;<br/>
      fletchers straighten the arrow shaft;<br/>
      carpenters shape the wood;<br/>
      the wise control themselves.
    </li>
    <li>
      Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm,<br/>
      even so the wise are not affected by praise or blame.
    </li>
    <li>
      On hearing the Teachings,<br/>
      the wise become perfectly purified,<br/>
      like a lake deep, clear and still.
    </li>
    <li>
      The good renounce (attachment for) everything.<br/>
      The virtuous do not prattle<br/>
      with a yearning for pleasures.<br/>
      The wise show no elation or depression<br/>
      when touched by happiness or sorrow.
    </li>
    <li>
      He is indeed virtuous, wise, and righteous<br/>
      who neither for his own sake<br/>
      nor for the sake of another (does any wrong),<br/>
      who does not crave for sons, wealth, or kingdom,<br/>
      and does not desire success by unjust means.
    </li>
    <li>
      Few among men are those<br/>
      who cross to the farther shore.<br/>
      The rest, the bulk of men,<br/>
      only run up and down the hither bank.
    </li>
    <li>
      But those who act according<br/>
      to the perfectly taught Dhamma<br/>
      will cross the realm of Death,<br/>
      so difficult to cross.
    </li>
    <li>
      Abandoning the dark way,<br/>
      let the wise man cultivate the bright path.<br/>
      Having gone from home to homelessness,<br/>
      let him yearn for that delight in detachment,<br/>
      so difficult to enjoy.<br/>
      Giving up sensual pleasures, with no attachment,<br/>
      let the wise man cleanse himself<br/>
      of defilements of the mind.
    </li>
    <li>
      Those whose minds have reached full excellence<br/>
      in the factors of enlightenment,<br/>
      who, having renounced acquisitiveness,<br/>
      rejoice in not clinging to things â€”<br/>
      rid of cankers, glowing with wisdom,<br/>
      they have attained Nibbana in this very life.
     </li>
