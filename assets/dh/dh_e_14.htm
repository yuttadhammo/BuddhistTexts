    <ol class="verse">
      <li>
        By what track can you trace<br/>
        that trackless Buddha of limitless range,<br/>
        whose victory nothing can undo,<br/>
        whom none of the vanquished defilements<br/>
        can ever pursue?
      </li>
      <li>
        By what track can you trace<br/>
        that trackless Buddha of limitless range,<br/>
        in whom exists no longer,<br/>
        the entangling and embroiling craving<br/>
        that perpetuates becoming?
      </li>
      <li>
        Those wise ones who are devoted to meditation<br/>
        and who delight in the calm of renunciation —<br/>
        such mindful ones, Supreme Buddhas,<br/>
        even the gods hold dear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hard is it to be born a man;<br/>
        hard is the life of mortals.<br/>
        Hard is it to gain the opportunity<br/>
        of hearing the Sublime Truth,<br/>
        and hard to encounter<br/>
        is the arising of the Buddhas.
      </li>
      <li>
        To avoid all evil, to cultivate good,<br/>
        and to cleanse one's mind —<br/>
        this is the teaching of the Buddhas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enduring patience is the highest austerity.<br/>
        "Nibbana is supreme," say the Buddhas.<br/>
        He is not a true monk who harms another,<br/>
        nor a true renunciate who oppresses others.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not despising, not harming,<br/>
        restraint according to the code of monastic discipline,<br/>
        moderation in food, dwelling in solitude,<br/>
        devotion to meditation —<br/>
        this is the teaching of the Buddhas.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no satisfying sensual desires,<br/>
        even with the rain of gold coins.<br/>
        For sensual pleasures<br/>
        give little satisfaction and much pain.<br/>
        Having understood this,<br/>
        the wise man finds no delight<br/>
        even in heavenly pleasures.<br/>
        The disciple of the Supreme Buddha<br/>
        delights in the destruction of craving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Driven only by fear,<br/>
        do men go for refuge to many places —<br/>
        to hills, woods, groves, trees and shrines.
      </li>
      <li>
        Such, indeed, is no safe refuge;<br/>
        such is not the refuge supreme.<br/>
        Not by resorting to such a refuge<br/>
        is one released from all suffering.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who has gone for refuge to the Buddha,<br/>
        the Teaching and his Order,<br/>
        penetrates with transcendental wisdom<br/>
        the Four Noble Truths —<br/>
        suffering,<br/>
        the cause of suffering,<br/>
        the cessation of suffering,<br/>
        and the Noble Eightfold Path<br/>
        leading to the cessation of suffering.
      </li>
      <li>
        This indeed is the safe refuge,<br/>
        this the refuge supreme.<br/>
        Having gone to such a refuge,<br/>
        one is released from all suffering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hard to find<br/>
        is the thoroughbred man (the Buddha);<br/>
        he is not born everywhere.<br/>
        Where such a wise man is born,<br/>
        that clan thrives happily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blessed is the birth of the Buddhas;<br/>
        blessed is the enunciation<br/>
        of the sacred Teaching;<br/>
        blessed is the harmony in the Order,<br/>
        and blessed is the spiritual pursuit<br/>
        of the united truth-seeker.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who reveres those worthy of reverence,<br/>
        the Buddhas and their disciples,<br/>
        who have transcended all obstacles<br/>
        and passed beyond the reach of sorrow and lamentation —<br/>
        he who reveres such peaceful and fearless ones,<br/>
        his merit none can compute by any measure.
