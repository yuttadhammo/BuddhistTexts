        Mind precedes all mental states.<br/>
        Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought.<br/>
        If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts<br/>
        suffering follows him<br/>
        like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.

        Mind precedes all mental states.<br/>
        Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought.<br/>
        If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts<br/>
        happiness follows him like his never-departing shadow.

    <li>
        "He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me."<br/>
        Those who harbor such thoughts<br/>
        do not still their hatred.

    <li>
        "He abused me, he struck me, he overpowered me, he robbed me."<br/>
        Those who do not harbor such thoughts<br/>
        still their hatred.
    </li>
    <li>
        Hatred is never appeased by hatred in this world.<br/>
        By non-hatred alone is hatred appeased.<br/>
        This is a law eternal.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are those who do not realize<br/>
        that one day we all must die.<br/>
        But those who do realize this<br/>
        settle their quarrels.
    </li>
    <li>
        Just as a storm throws down a weak tree,<br/>
        so does Mara overpower the man<br/>
        who lives for the pursuit of pleasures,<br/>
        who is uncontrolled in his senses,<br/>
        immoderate in eating, indolent, and dissipated.
    </li>
    <li>
        Just as a storm cannot prevail against a rocky mountain,<br/>
        so Mara can never overpower the man<br/>
        who lives meditating on the impurities,<br/>
        who is controlled in his senses,<br/>
        moderate in eating, and filled with faith and earnest effort.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whoever being depraved,<br/>
        devoid of self-control and truthfulness,<br/>
        should don the monk's yellow robe,<br/>
        he surely is not worthy of the robe.
    </li>
    <li>
        But whoever is purged of depravity,<br/>
        well-established in virtues<br/>
        and filled with self-control and truthfulness,<br/>
        he indeed is worthy of the yellow robe.
    </li>
    <li>
        Those who mistake the unessential to be essential<br/>
        and the essential to be unessential,<br/>
        dwelling in wrong thoughts,<br/>
        never arrive at the essential.
    </li>
    <li>
        Those who know the essential to be essential<br/>
        and the unessential to be unessential,<br/>
        dwelling in right thoughts,<br/>
        do arrive at the essential.
    </li>
    <li>
        Just as rain breaks through an ill-thatched house,<br/>
        so passion penetrates an undeveloped mind.
    </li>
    <li>
        Just as rain does not break through a well-thatched house,<br/>
        so passion never penetrates a well-developed mind.
    </li>
    <li>
        The evil-doer grieves here and hereafter;<br/>
        he grieves in both the worlds.<br/>
        He laments and is afflicted,<br/>
        recollecting his own impure deeds.
    </li>
    <li>
        The doer of good rejoices here and hereafter;<br/>
        he rejoices in both the worlds.<br/>
        He rejoices and exults,<br/>
        recollecting his own pure deeds.
    </li>
    <li>
        The evil-doer suffers here and hereafter;<br/>
        he suffers in both the worlds.<br/>
        The thought, "Evil have I done," torments him,<br/>
        and he suffers even more when gone to realms of woe.
    </li>
    <li>
        The doer of good delights here and hereafter;<br/>
        he delights in both the worlds.<br/>
        The thought, "Good have I done," delights him,<br/>
        and he delights even more when gone to realms of bliss.
    </li>
    <li>
        Much though he recites the sacred texts,<br/>
        but acts not accordingly,<br/>
        that heedless man is like a cowherd<br/>
        who only counts the cows of others —<br/>
        he does not partake of the blessings of the holy life.<br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        Little though he recites the sacred texts,<br/>
        but puts the Teaching into practice,<br/>
        forsaking lust, hatred, and delusion,<br/>
        with true wisdom and emancipated mind,<br/>
        clinging to nothing of this or any other world —<br/>
        he indeed partakes of the blessings of a holy life.
