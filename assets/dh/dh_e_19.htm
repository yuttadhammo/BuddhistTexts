      <li>
        Not by passing arbitrary judgments<br/>
        does a man become just;<br/>
        a wise man is he<br/>
        who investigates both right and wrong.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who does not judge others arbitrarily,<br/>
        but passes judgment impartially<br/>
        according to the truth,<br/>
        that sagacious man is a guardian of law<br/>
        and is called just.
      </li>
      <li>
        One is not wise because one speaks much.<br/>
        He who is peaceable,<br/>
        friendly and fearless is called wise.
      </li>
      <li>
        A man is not versed in Dhamma<br/>
        because he speaks much.<br/>
        He who, after hearing a little Dhamma,<br/>
        realizes its truth directly<br/>
        and is not heedless of it,<br/>
        is truly versed in the Dhamma.
      </li>
      <li>
        A monk is not Elder because his head is gray.<br/>
        He is but ripe in age,<br/>
        and he is called one grown old in vain.
      </li>
      <li>
        One in whom there is truthfulness,<br/>
        virtue, inoffensiveness, restraint and self-mastery,<br/>
        who is free from defilements and is wise —<br/>
        he is truly called an Elder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not by mere eloquence nor by beauty of form<br/>
        does a man become accomplished,<br/>
        if he is jealous, selfish and deceitful.
      </li>
      <li>
        But he in whom these are wholly destroyed,<br/>
        uprooted and extinct,<br/>
        and who has cast out hatred —<br/>
        that wise man is truly accomplished.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not by shaven head does a man<br/>
        who is indisciplined and untruthful<br/>
        become a monk. How can he<br/>
        who is full of desire and greed be a monk?
      </li>
      <li>
        He who wholly subdues evil both small and great<br/>
        is called a monk,<br/>
        because he has overcome all evil.
      </li>
      <li>
        He is not a monk<br/>
        just because he lives on others' alms.<br/>
        Not by adopting outward form<br/>
        does one become a true monk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whoever here (in the Dispensation)<br/>
        lives a holy life,<br/>
        transcending both merit and demerit,<br/>
        and walks with understanding in this world —<br/>
        he is truly called a monk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not by observing silence does one become a sage,<br/>
        if he be foolish and ignorant.<br/>
        But that man is wise who,<br/>
        as if holding a balance-scale<br/>
        accepts only the good.
      </li>
      <li>
        The sage (thus) rejecting the evil,<br/>
        is truly a sage.<br/>
        Since he comprehends both<br/>
        (present and future) worlds,<br/>
        he is called a sage.
      </li>
      <li>
        He is not noble who injures living beings.<br/>
        He is called noble<br/>
        because he is harmless towards all living beings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not by rules and observances,<br/>
        not even by much learning,<br/>
        nor by gain of absorption,<br/>
        nor by a life of seclusion,<br/>
        nor by thinking,<br/>
        "I enjoy the bliss of renunciation,<br/>
        which is not experienced by the worldling"<br/>
        should you, O monks, rest content,<br/>
        until the utter destruction of cankers<br/>
        (Arahantship) is reached.
