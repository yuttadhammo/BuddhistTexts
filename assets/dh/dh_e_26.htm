    <ol class="verse">
      <li>
        Exert yourself, O holy man!<br/>
        Cut off the stream (of craving),<br/>
        and discard sense desires.<br/>
        Knowing the destruction<br/>
        of all the conditioned things,<br/>
        become, O holy man, the knower<br/>
        of the Uncreated (Nibbana)!
      </li>
      <li>
        When a holy man has reached<br/>
        the summit of two paths<br/>
        (meditative concentration and insight),<br/>
        he knows the truth<br/>
        and all his fetters fall away.
      </li>
      <li>
        He for whom there is neither this shore<br/>
        nor the other shore, nor yet both,<br/>
        he who is free of cares and is unfettered —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who is meditative, stainless and settled,<br/>
        whose work is done and who is free from cankers,<br/>
        having reached the highest goal —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        The sun shines by day,<br/>
        the moon shines by night.<br/>
        The warrior shines in armor,<br/>
        the holy man shines in meditation.<br/>
        But the Buddha shines resplendent<br/>
        all day and all night.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because he has discarded evil,<br/>
        he is called a holy man.<br/>
        Because he is serene in conduct,<br/>
        he is called a recluse.<br/>
        And because he has renounced his impurities,<br/>
        he is called a renunciate.
      </li>
      <li>
        One should not strike a holy man,<br/>
        nor should a holy man,<br/>
        when struck, give way to anger.<br/>
        Shame on him who strikes a holy man,<br/>
        and more shame on him who gives way to anger.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nothing is better for a holy man<br/>
        than when he holds his mind back<br/>
        from what is endearing.<br/>
        To the extent the intent to harm wears away,<br/>
        to that extent does suffering subside.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who does no evil in deed, word and thought,<br/>
        who is restrained in these three ways —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.<br/>
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as a brahman priest<br/>
        reveres his sacrificial fire,<br/>
        even so should one devoutly revere<br/>
        the person from whom one has learned<br/>
        the Dhamma taught by the Buddha.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not by matted hair, nor by lineage,<br/>
        nor by birth does one become a holy man.<br/>
        But he in whom truth and righteousness exist —<br/>
        he is pure, he is a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the use of your matted hair,<br/>
        O witless man?<br/>
        What of your garment of antelope's hide?<br/>
        Within you is the tangle (of passion);<br/>
        only outwardly do you cleanse yourself.
      </li>
      <li>
        The person who wears a robe made of rags,<br/>
        who is lean, with veins showing all over the body,<br/>
        and who meditates alone in the forest —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        I do not call him a holy man<br/>
        because of his lineage or high-born mother.<br/>
        If he is full of impeding attachments,<br/>
        he is just a supercilious man.<br/>
        But who is free from impediments and clinging —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who, having cut off all fetters,<br/>
        trembles no more, who has overcome<br/>
        all attachments and is emancipated —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who has cut off the thong (of hatred),<br/>
        the band (of craving),<br/>
        and the rope (of false views),<br/>
        together with the appurtenances<br/>
        (latent evil tendencies),<br/>
        he who has removed the crossbar (of ignorance)<br/>
        and is enlightened —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who without resentment endures abuse,<br/>
        beating and punishment;<br/>
        whose power, real might, is patience —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who is free from anger, is devout,<br/>
        virtuous, without craving, self-subdued<br/>
        and bears his final body — him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        Like water on a lotus leaf,<br/>
        or a mustard seed on the point of a needle,<br/>
        he who does not cling to sensual pleasures —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who in this very life realizes for himself<br/>
        the end of suffering,<br/>
        who has laid aside the burden<br/>
        and become emancipated —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who has profound knowledge, who is wise,<br/>
        skilled in discerning the right or wrong path,<br/>
        and has reached the highest goal —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who holds aloof<br/>
        from householders and ascetics alike,<br/>
        and wanders about with no fixed abode<br/>
        and but few wants —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who has renounced violence<br/>
        towards all living beings, weak or strong,<br/>
        who neither kills nor causes others to kill —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who is friendly amidst the hostile,<br/>
        peaceful amidst the violent,<br/>
        and unattached amidst the attached —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He whose lust and hatred,<br/>
        pride and hypocrisy have fallen off<br/>
        like a mustard seed from the point of a needle —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who utters gentle,<br/>
        instructive and truthful words,<br/>
        who imprecates none —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who in this world takes nothing<br/>
        that is not given to him,<br/>
        be it long or short,<br/>
        small or big, good or bad —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who wants nothing<br/>
        of either this world or the next,<br/>
        who is desire-free and emancipated —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who has no attachment,<br/>
        who through perfect knowledge<br/>
        is free from doubts<br/>
        and has plunged into the Deathless —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who in this world has transcended<br/>
        the ties of both merit and demerit,<br/>
        who is sorrowless, stainless and pure —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He, who, like the moon, is spotless and pure,<br/>
        serene and clear,<br/>
        who has destroyed the delight in existence —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who, having traversed<br/>
        this miry, perilous and delusive round of existence,<br/>
        has crossed over and reached the other shore;<br/>
        who is meditative, calm, free from doubt,<br/>
        and, clinging to nothing, has attained to Nibbana —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who, having abandoned sensual pleasures,<br/>
        has renounced the household life<br/>
        and become a homeless one;<br/>
        has destroyed both sensual desire<br/>
        and continued existence —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who, having abandoned craving,<br/>
        has renounced the household life<br/>
        and become a homeless one,<br/>
        has destroyed both craving<br/>
        and continued existence —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who, casting off human bonds<br/>
        and transcending heavenly ties,<br/>
        is wholly delivered of all bondages —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who, having cast off likes and dislikes,<br/>
        has become tranquil,<br/>
        is rid of the substrata of existence<br/>
        and like a hero has conquered all the worlds —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who in every way knows<br/>
        the death and rebirth of all beings,<br/>
        and is totally detached,<br/>
        blessed and enlightened —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He whose track no gods, no angels, no humans trace,<br/>
        the arahant who has destroyed all cankers —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who clings to nothing<br/>
        of the past, present and future,<br/>
        who has no attachment<br/>
        and holds on to nothing —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He, the Noble, the Excellent,<br/>
        the Heroic, the Great Sage,<br/>
        the Conqueror, the Passionless,<br/>
        the Pure, the Enlightened one —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who knows his former births,<br/>
        who sees heaven and hell,<br/>
        who has reached the end of births<br/>
        and attained to the perfection of insight,<br/>
        the sage who has reached the summit<br/>
        of spiritual excellence —<br/>
        him do I call a holy man.
