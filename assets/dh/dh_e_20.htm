    <ol class="verse">
      <li>
        Of all the paths<br/>
        the Eightfold Path is the best;<br/>
        of all the truths<br/>
        the Four Noble Truths are the best;<br/>
        of all things<br/>
        passionlessness is the best:<br/>
        of men the Seeing One<br/>
        (the Buddha) is the best.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is the only path;<br/>
        there is none other<br/>
        for the purification of insight.<br/>
        Tread this path,<br/>
        and you will bewilder Mara.
      </li>
      <li>
        Walking upon this path<br/>
        you will make an end of suffering.<br/>
        Having discovered<br/>
        how to pull out the thorn of lust,<br/>
        I make known the path.
      </li>
      <li>
        You yourselves must strive;<br/>
        the Buddhas only point the way.<br/>
        Those meditative ones who tread the path<br/>
        are released from the bonds of Mara.
      </li>
      <li>
        "All conditioned things are impermanent" —<br/>
        when one sees this with wisdom,<br/>
        one turns away from suffering.<br/>
        This is the path to purification.
      </li>
      <li>
        "All conditioned things are unsatisfactory" —<br/>
        when one sees this with wisdom,<br/>
        one turns away from suffering.<br/>
        This is the path to purification.
      </li>
      <li>
        "All things are not-self" —<br/>
        when one sees this with wisdom,<br/>
        one turns away from suffering.<br/>
        This is the path to purification.
      </li>
      <li>
        The idler
        who does not exert himself when he should,<br/>
        who though young and strong is full of sloth,<br/>
        with a mind full of vain thoughts —<br/>
        such an indolent man<br/>
        does not find the path to wisdom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let a man be watchful of speech,<br/>
        well controlled in mind,<br/>
        and not commit evil in bodily action.<br/>
        Let him purify these three courses of action,<br/>
        and win the path made known by the Great Sage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wisdom springs from meditation;<br/>
        without meditation wisdom wanes.<br/>
        Having known these two paths of progress and decline,<br/>
        let a man so conduct himself<br/>
        that his wisdom may increase.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut down the forest (lust), but not the tree;<br/>
        from the forest springs fear.<br/>
        Having cut down the forest<br/>
        and the underbrush (desire),<br/>
        be passionless, O monks!
      </li>
      <li>
        For so long as the underbrush of desire,<br/>
        even the most subtle,<br/>
        of a man towards a woman is not cut down,<br/>
        his mind is in bondage,<br/>
        like the sucking calf to its mother.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut off your affection in the manner of a man<br/>
        plucks with his hand an autumn lotus.<br/>
        Cultivate only the path to peace, Nibbana,<br/>
        as made known by the Exalted One.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Here shall I live during the rains,<br/>
        here in winter and summer" —<br/>
        thus thinks the fool.<br/>
        He does not realize the danger<br/>
        (that death might intervene).
      </li>
      <li>
        As a great flood<br/>
        carries away a sleeping village,<br/>
        so death seizes and carries away<br/>
        the man with a clinging mind,<br/>
        doting on his children and cattle.
      </li>
      <li>
        For him who is assailed by death<br/>
        there is no protection by kinsmen.<br/>
        None there are to save him —<br/>
        no sons, nor father, nor relatives.
      </li>
      <li>
        Realizing this fact, let the wise man,<br/>
        restrained by morality,<br/>
        hasten to clear the path leading to Nibbana.
      </li>
