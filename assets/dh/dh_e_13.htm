      <li>
        Follow not the vulgar way;<br/>
        live not in heedlessness;<br/>
        hold not false views;<br/>
        linger not long in worldly existence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arise! Do not be heedless!<br/>
        Lead a righteous life.<br/>
        The righteous live happily<br/>
        both in this world and the next.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lead a righteous life;<br/>
        lead not a base life.<br/>
        The righteous live happily<br/>
        both in this world and the next.
      </li>
      <li>
        One who looks upon the world<br/>
        as a bubble and a mirage,<br/>
        him the King of Death sees not.
      </li>
      <li>
        Come! Behold this world,<br/>
        which is like a decorated royal chariot.<br/>
        Here fools flounder,<br/>
        but the wise have no attachment to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who having been heedless<br/>
        is heedless no more,<br/>
        illuminates this world<br/>
        like the moon freed from clouds.
      </li>
      <li>
        He, who by good deeds<br/>
        covers the evil he has done,<br/>
        illuminates this world<br/>
        like the moon freed from clouds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blind is the world;<br/>
        here only a few possess insight.<br/>
        Only a few,<br/>
        like birds escaping from the net,<br/>
        go to realms of bliss.
      </li>
      <li>
        Swans fly on the path of the sun;<br/>
        men pass through the air by psychic powers;<br/>
        the wise are led away from the world<br/>
        after vanquishing Mara and his host.
      </li>
      <li>
        For a liar who has violated<br/>
        the one law (of truthfulness)<br/>
        who holds in scorn the hereafter,<br/>
        there is no evil that he cannot do.
      </li>
      <li>
        Truly, misers fare not to heavenly realms;<br/>
        nor, indeed, do fools praise generosity.<br/>
        But the wise man rejoices in giving,<br/>
        and by that alone does he become happy hereafter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better than sole sovereignty over the earth,<br/>
        better than going to heaven,<br/>
        better even than lordship over all the worlds<br/>
        is the supramundane Fruition of Stream Entrance.
      </li>
