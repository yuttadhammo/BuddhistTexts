    <ol class="verse">
      <li>
        Heedfulness is the path to the Deathless.<br/>
        Heedlessness is the path to death.<br/>
        The heedful die not.<br/>
        The heedless are as if dead already.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clearly understanding this excellence of heedfulness,<br/>
        the wise exult therein<br/>
        and enjoy the resort of the Noble Ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        The wise ones,
        ever meditative and steadfastly persevering,<br/>
        alone experience Nibbana,<br/>
        the incomparable freedom from bondage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ever grows the glory of him who is energetic,<br/>
        mindful and pure in conduct,<br/>
        discerning and self-controlled,<br/>
        righteous and heedful.
      </li>
      <li>
        By effort and heedfulness,<br/>
        discipline and self-mastery,<br/>
        let the wise one make for himself<br/>
        an island which no flood can overwhelm.
      </li>
      <li>
        The foolish and ignorant<br/>
        indulge in heedlessness,<br/>
        but the wise one<br/>
        keeps his heedfulness as his best treasure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not give way to heedlessness.<br/>
        Do not indulge in sensual pleasures.<br/>
        Only the heedful and meditative<br/>
        attain great happiness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as one upon the summit of a mountain<br/>
        beholds the groundlings,<br/>
        even so when the wise man casts away heedlessness<br/>
        by heedfulness<br/>
        and ascends the high tower of wisdom,<br/>
        this sorrowless sage<br/>
        beholds the sorrowing and foolish multitude.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heedful among the heedless,<br/>
        wide-awake among the sleepy,<br/>
        the wise man advances like a swift horse<br/>
        leaving behind a weak jade.
      </li>
      <li>
        By heedfulness did Indra become the overlord of the gods.<br/>
        Heedfulness is ever praised,<br/>
        and heedlessness ever despised.
      </li>
      <li>
        The monk who delights in heedfulness<br/>
        and looks with fear at heedlessness<br/>
        advances like fire,<br/>
        burning all fetters, small and large.
      </li>
      <li>
        The monk who delights in heedfulness<br/>
        and looks with fear at heedlessness<br/>
        will not fall.<br/>
        He is close to Nibbana.
      </li>
