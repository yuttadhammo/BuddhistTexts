      <li>
        One should give up anger,<br/>
        renounce pride,<br/>
        and overcome all fetters.<br/>
        Suffering never befalls him<br/>
        who clings not to mind and body<br/>
        and is detached.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who checks rising anger<br/>
        as a charioteer checks a rolling chariot,<br/>
        him I call a true charioteer.<br/>
        Others only hold the reins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Overcome the angry by non-anger;<br/>
        overcome the wicked by goodness;<br/>
        overcome the miser by generosity;<br/>
        overcome the liar by truth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Speak the truth;<br/>
        yield not to anger;<br/>
        when asked, give even if you only have a little.<br/>
        By these three means<br/>
        can one reach the presence of the gods.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those sages who are inoffensive<br/>
        and ever restrained in body,<br/>
        go to the Deathless State,<br/>
        where, having gone, they grieve no more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those who are ever vigilant,<br/>
        who discipline themselves day and night,<br/>
        and are ever intent upon Nibbana â€”<br/>
        their defilements fade away.
      </li>
      <li>
        O Atula! Indeed, this is an ancient practice,<br/>
        not one only of today:<br/>
        they blame those who remain silent,<br/>
        they blame those who speak much,<br/>
        they blame those who speak in moderation.<br/>
        There is none in the world who is not blamed.
      </li>
      <li>
        There never was, there never will be, nor is there now,<br/>
        a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praised.
      </li>
      <li>
        But the man whom the wise praise,<br/>
        after observing him day after day,<br/>
        is one of flawless character, wise,<br/>
        and endowed with knowledge and virtue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Who can blame such a one,<br/>
        as worthy as a coin of refined gold?<br/>
        Even the gods praise him;<br/>
        by Brahma, too, is he praised.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let a man guard himself<br/>
        against irritability in bodily action;<br/>
        let him be controlled in deed.<br/>
        Abandoning bodily misconduct,<br/>
        let him practice good conduct in deed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let a man guard himself<br/>
        against irritability in speech;<br/>
        let him be controlled in speech.<br/>
        Abandoning verbal misconduct,<br/>
        let him practice good conduct in speech.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let a man guard himself<br/>
        against irritability in thought;<br/>
        let him be controlled in mind.<br/>
        Abandoning mental misconduct,<br/>
        let him practice good conduct in thought.
      </li>
      <li>
        The wise are controlled in bodily action,<br/>
        controlled in speech and controlled in thought.<br/>
        They are truly well-controlled.
      </li>
