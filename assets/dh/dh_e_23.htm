    <ol class="verse">
      <li>
        As an elephant in the battlefield<br/>
        withstands arrows shot from bows all around,<br/>
        even so shall I endure abuse.<br/>
        There are many, indeed, who lack virtue.
      </li>
      <li>
        A tamed elephant is led into a crowd,<br/>
        and the king mounts a tamed elephant.<br/>
        Best among men<br/>
        is the subdued one who endures abuse.
      </li>
      <li>
        Excellent are well-trained mules,<br/>
        thoroughbred Sindhu horses<br/>
        and noble tusker elephants.<br/>
        But better still is the man<br/>
        who has subdued himself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not by these mounts, however,<br/>
        would one go to the Untrodden Land (Nibbana),<br/>
        as one who is self-tamed<br/>
        goes by his own tamed and well-controlled mind.
      </li>
      <li>
        Musty during rut,<br/>
        the tusker named Dhanapalaka is uncontrollable.<br/>
        Held in captivity,<br/>
        the tusker does not touch a morsel,<br/>
        but only longingly<br/>
        calls to mind the elephant forest.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a man is sluggish and gluttonous,<br/>
        sleeping and rolling around in bed<br/>
        like a fat domestic pig,<br/>
        that sluggard undergoes rebirth again and again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Formerly this mind wandered about as it liked,<br/>
        where it wished and according to its pleasure,<br/>
        but now I shall thoroughly master it<br/>
        with wisdom as a mahout controls with his ankus<br/>
        an elephant in rut.
      </li>
      <li>
        Delight in heedfulness!<br/>
        Guard well your thoughts!<br/>
        Draw yourself out of this bog of evil,<br/>
        even as an elephant draws himself out of the mud.
      </li>
      <li>
        If for company you find<br/>
        a wise and prudent friend<br/>
        who leads a good life,<br/>
        you should, overcoming all impediments,<br/>
        keep his company joyously and mindfully.
      </li>
      <li>
        If for company you cannot find<br/>
        a wise and prudent friend<br/>
        who leads a good life, then,<br/>
        like a king who leaves behind a conquered kingdom,<br/>
        or like a lone elephant in the elephant forest,<br/>
        you should go your way alone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better it is to live alone;<br/>
        there is no fellowship with a fool.<br/>
        Live alone and do no evil;<br/>
        be carefree like an elephant<br/>
        in the elephant forest.
      </li>
      <li>
        Good are friends when need arises;<br/>
        good is contentment with just what one has;<br/>
        good is merit when life is at an end,<br/>
        and good is the abandoning of all suffering<br/>
        (through Arahantship).
      </li>
      <li>
        In this world,<br/>
        good it is to serve one's mother,<br/>
        good it is to serve one's father,<br/>
        good it is to serve the monks,<br/>
        and good it is to serve the holy men.
      </li>
      <li>
        Good is virtue until life's end,<br/>
        good is faith that is steadfast,<br/>
        good is the acquisition of wisdom,<br/>
        and good is the avoidance of evil.
      </li>
