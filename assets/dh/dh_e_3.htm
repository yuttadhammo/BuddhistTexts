   <ol class="verse">
     <li>
      Just as a fletcher straightens an arrow shaft,<br/>
      even so the discerning man straightens his mind â€”<br/>
      so fickle and unsteady,<br/>
      so difficult to guard.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a fish when pulled out of water<br/>
      and cast on land throbs and quivers,<br/>
      even so is this mind agitated.<br/>
      Hence should one abandon the realm of Mara.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wonderful, indeed, it is to subdue the mind,<br/>
      so difficult to subdue,<br/>
      ever swift, and seizing whatever it desires.<br/>
      A tamed mind brings happiness.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let the discerning man guard the mind,<br/>
      so difficult to detect and extremely subtle,<br/>
      seizing whatever it desires.<br/>
      A guarded mind brings happiness.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dwelling in the cave (of the heart),<br/>
      the mind, without form, wanders far and alone.<br/>
      Those who subdue this mind<br/>
      are liberated from the bonds of Mara.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wisdom never becomes perfect<br/>
      in one whose mind is not steadfast,<br/>
      who knows not the Good Teaching<br/>
      and whose faith wavers.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is no fear for an awakened one,<br/>
      whose mind is not sodden (by lust)<br/>
      nor afflicted (by hate),<br/>
      and who has gone beyond both merit and demerit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Realizing that this body is<br/>
      as fragile as a clay pot,<br/>
      and fortifying this mind<br/>
      like a well-fortified city,<br/>
      fight out Mara with the sword of wisdom.<br/>
      Then, guarding the conquest,<br/>
      remain unattached.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ere long, alas!<br/>
      this body will lie upon the earth,<br/>
      unheeded and lifeless,<br/>
      like a useless log.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy,<br/>
      or a hater to a hater,<br/>
      an ill-directed mind<br/>
      inflicts on oneself a greater harm.
    </li>
    <li>
      Neither mother, father,<br/>
      nor any other relative<br/>
      can do one greater good<br/>
      than one's own well-directed mind.
    </li>
