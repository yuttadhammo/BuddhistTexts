      <li>
        The fever of passion<br/>
        exists not for him who has completed the journey,<br/>
        who is sorrowless and wholly set free,<br/>
        and has broken all ties.
    </li>
    <li>
      The mindful ones exert themselves.<br/>
      They are not attached to any home;<br/>
      like swans that abandon the lake,<br/>
      they leave home after home behind.
    </li>
    <li>
      Those who do not accumulate<br/>
      and are wise regarding food,<br/>
      whose object is the Void,<br/>
      the Unconditioned Freedom —<br/>
      their track cannot be traced,<br/>
      like that of birds in the air.
    </li>
    <li>
      He whose cankers are destroyed<br/>
      and who is not attached to food,<br/>
      whose object is the Void,<br/>
      the Unconditioned Freedom —<br/>
      his path cannot be traced,<br/>
      like that of birds in the air.
    </li>
    <li>
      Even the gods hold dear the wise one,<br/>
      whose senses are subdued<br/>
      ike horses well trained by a charioteer,<br/>
      whose pride is destroyed<br/>
      and who is free from the cankers.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is no more worldly existence<br/>
      for the wise one who,<br/>
      like the earth, resents nothing,<br/>
      who is firm as a high pillar<br/>
      and as pure as a deep pool free from mud.
    </li>
    <li>
      Calm is his thought, calm his speech,<br/>
      and calm his deed, who, truly knowing,<br/>
      is wholly freed,<br/>
      perfectly tranquil and wise.
    </li>
    <li>
      The man who is without blind faith,<br/>
      who knows the Uncreated,<br/>
      who has severed all links,<br/>
      destroyed all causes (for karma, good and evil),<br/>
      and thrown out all desires —<br/>
      he, truly, is the most excellent of men.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inspiring, indeed,<br/>
      is that place where Arahants dwell,<br/>
      be it a village, a forest, a vale, or a hill.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inspiring are the forests<br/>
      in which worldlings find no pleasure.<br/>
      There the passionless will rejoice,<br/>
      for they seek no sensual pleasures.
    </li>
