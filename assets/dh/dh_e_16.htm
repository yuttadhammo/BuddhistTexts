      <li>
        Giving himself to things to be shunned<br/>
        and not exerting where exertion is needed,<br/>
        a seeker after pleasures,<br/>
        having given up his true welfare,<br/>
        envies those intent upon theirs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seek no intimacy with the beloved<br/>
        and also not with the unloved,<br/>
        for not to see the beloved<br/>
        and to see the unloved,<br/>
        both are painful.
      </li>
      <li>
        Therefore hold nothing dear,<br/>
        for separation from the dear is painful.<br/>
        There are no bonds<br/>
        for those who have nothing beloved or unloved.
      </li>
      <li>
        From endearment springs grief,<br/>
        from endearment springs fear.<br/>
        From him who is wholly free from endearment<br/>
        there is no grief, whence then fear?
      </li>
      <li>
        From affection springs grief,<br/>
        from affection springs fear.<br/>
        From him who is wholly free from affection<br/>
        there is no grief, whence then fear?
      </li>
      <li>
        From attachment springs grief,<br/>
        from attachment springs fear.<br/>
        From him who is wholly free from attachment<br/>
        there is no grief, whence then fear?
      </li>
      <li>
        From lust springs grief,<br/>
        from lust springs fear.<br/>
        From him who is wholly free from craving<br/>
        there is no grief; whence then fear?
      </li>
      <li>
        From craving springs grief,<br/>
        from craving springs fear.<br/>
        From him who is wholly free from craving<br/>
        there is no grief; whence then fear?
      </li>
      <li>
        People hold dear him<br/>
        who embodies virtue and insight,<br/>
        who is principled,<br/>
        has realized the truth,<br/>
        and who himself does what he ought to be doing.<br/>
      </li>
      <li>
        One who is intent upon the Ineffable (Nibbana),<br/>
        dwells with mind inspired (by supramundane wisdom),<br/>
        and is no more bound by sense pleasures â€”<br/>
        such a man is called "One Bound Upstream."
      </li>
      <li>
        When, after a long absence,<br/>
        a man safely returns from afar,<br/>
        his relatives, friends and well-wishers<br/>
        welcome him home on arrival.
      </li>
      <li>
        As kinsmen welcome a dear one on arrival,<br/>
        even so his own good deeds<br/>
        will welcome the doer of good<br/>
        who has gone from this world to the next.
