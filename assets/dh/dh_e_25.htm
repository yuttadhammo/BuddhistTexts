      <li>
        Good is restraint over the eye;<br/>
        good is restraint over the ear;<br/>
        good is restraint over the nose;<br/>
        good is restraint over the tongue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Good is restraint in the body;<br/>
        good is restraint in speech;<br/>
        good is restraint in thought.<br/>
        Restraint everywhere is good.<br/>
        The monk restrained in every way<br/>
        is freed from all suffering.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who has control over his hands,<br/>
        feet and tongue;<br/>
        who is fully controlled,<br/>
        delights in inward development,<br/>
        is absorbed in meditation,<br/>
        keeps to himself and is contented —<br/>
        him do people call a monk.
      </li>
      <li>
        That monk who has control over his tongue,<br/>
        is moderate in speech, unassuming<br/>
        and who explains the Teaching<br/>
        in both letter and spirit —<br/>
        whatever he says is pleasing.
      </li>
      <li>
        The monk who abides in the Dhamma,<br/>
        delights in the Dhamma,<br/>
        meditates on the Dhamma,<br/>
        and bears the Dhamma well in mind —<br/>
        he does not fall away<br/>
        from the sublime Dhamma.
      </li>
      <li>
        One should not despise<br/>
        what one has received,<br/>
        nor envy the gains of others.<br/>
        The monk who envies the gains of others<br/>
        does not attain to meditative absorption.
      </li>
      <li>
        A monk who does not despise<br/>
        what he has received,<br/>
        even though it be little,<br/>
        who is pure in livelihood<br/>
        and unremitting in effort —<br/>
        him even the gods praise.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who has no attachment whatsoever<br/>
        for the mind and body,<br/>
        who does not grieve for what he has not —<br/>
        he is truly called a monk.
      </li>
      <li>
        The monk who abides in universal love<br/>
        and is deeply devoted<br/>
        to the Teaching of the Buddha<br/>
        attains the peace of Nibbana,<br/>
        the bliss of the cessation<br/>
        of all conditioned things.
      </li>
      <li>
        Empty this boat, O monk!<br/>
        Emptied, it will sail lightly.<br/>
        Rid of lust and hatred,<br/>
        you shall reach Nibbana.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut off the five, abandon the five,<br/>
        and cultivate the five.<br/>
        The monk who has overcome the five bonds<br/>
        is called one who has crossed the flood.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meditate, O monk! Do not be heedless.<br/>
        Let not your mind whirl on sensual pleasures.<br/>
        Heedless, do not swallow a red-hot iron ball,<br/>
        lest you cry when burning, "O this is painful!"
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no meditative concentration<br/>
        for him who lacks insight,<br/>
        and no insight for him<br/>
        who lacks meditative concentration.<br/>
        He in whom are found both<br/>
        meditative concentration and insight,<br/>
        indeed, is close to Nibbana.
      </li>
      <li>
        The monk who has retired<br/>
        to a solitary abode<br/>
        and calmed his mind,<br/>
        who comprehends the Dhamma with insight,<br/>
        in him there arises a delight<br/>
        that transcends all human delights.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whenever he sees with insight<br/>
        the rise and fall of the aggregates,<br/>
        he is full of joy and happiness.<br/>
        To the discerning one<br/>
        this reflects the Deathless.
      </li>
      <li>
        Control of the senses, contentment, restraint<br/>
        according to the code of monastic discipline —<br/>
        these form the basis of holy life<br/>
        here for the wise monk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let him associate with friends<br/>
        who are noble, energetic, and pure in life,<br/>
        let him be cordial and refined in conduct.<br/>
        Thus, full of joy,<br/>
        he will make an end of suffering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as the jasmine creeper<br/>
        sheds its withered flowers,<br/>
        even so, O monks,<br/>
        should you totally shed lust and hatred!
      </li>
      <li>
        The monk who is calm in body,<br/>
        calm in speech,<br/>
        calm in thought,<br/>
        well-composed<br/>
        and who has spewn out worldliness —<br/>
        he, truly, is called serene.
      </li>
      <li>
        By oneself one must censure oneself<br/>
        and scrutinize oneself.<br/>
        The self-guarded and mindful monk<br/>
        will always live in happiness.
      </li>
      <li>
        One is one's own protector,<br/>
        one is one's own refuge.<br/>
        Therefore, one should control oneself,<br/>
        even as a trader controls a noble steed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Full of joy, full of faith<br/>
        in the Teaching of the Buddha,<br/>
        the monk attains the Peaceful State,<br/>
        the bliss of cessation of conditioned things.
      </li>
      <li>
        That monk who while young devotes himself<br/>
        to the Teaching of the Buddha<br/>
        illumines this world like the moon<br/>
        freed from clouds.
      </li>
