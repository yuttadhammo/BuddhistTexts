   <ol class="verse">
     <li>
      Long is the night to the sleepless;<br/>
      long is the league to the weary.<br/>
      Long is worldly existence to fools<br/>
      who know not the Sublime Truth.
    </li>
    <li>
      Should a seeker not find a companion<br/>
      who is better or equal,<br/>
      let him resolutely pursue a solitary course;<br/>
      there is no fellowship with the fool.
    </li>
    <li>
      The fool worries, thinking,<br/>
      "I have sons, I have wealth."<br/>
      Indeed, when he himself is not his own,<br/>
      whence are sons, whence is wealth?
    </li>
    <li>
      A fool who knows his foolishness<br/>
      is wise at least to that extent,<br/>
      but a fool who thinks himself wise<br/>
      is a fool indeed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Though all his life<br/>
      a fool associates with a wise man,<br/>
      he no more comprehends the Truth<br/>
      than a spoon tastes the flavor of the soup.
    </li>
    <li>
      Though only for a moment<br/>
      a discerning person associates with a wise man,<br/>
      quickly he comprehends the Truth,<br/>
      just as the tongue tastes the flavor of the soup.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fools of little wit<br/>
      are enemies unto themselves<br/>
      as they move about doing evil deeds,<br/>
      the fruits of which are bitter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ill done is that action of doing<br/>
      which one repents later,<br/>
      and the fruit of which<br/>
      one, weeping, reaps with tears.
    </li>
    <li>
      Well done is that action of doing<br/>
      which one repents not later,<br/>
      and the fruit of which<br/>
      one reaps with delight and happiness.
    </li>
    <li>
      So long as an evil deed has not ripened,<br/>
      the fool thinks it as sweet as honey.<br/>
      But when the evil deed ripens,<br/>
      the fool comes to grief.
    </li>
    <li>
      Month after month a fool may eat his food<br/>
      with the tip of a blade of grass,<br/>
      but he still is not worth a sixteenth part<br/>
      of the those who have comprehended the Truth.
    </li>
    <li>
      Truly, an evil deed committed<br/>
      does not immediately bear fruit,<br/>
      like milk that does not turn sour all at once.<br/>
      But smoldering,<br/>
      it follows the fool like fire covered by ashes.
    </li>
    <li>
      To his own ruin the fool gains knowledge,<br/>
      for it cleaves his head<br/>
      and destroys his innate goodness.
    </li>
    <li>
      The fool seeks undeserved reputation,<br/>
      precedence among monks,<br/>
      authority over monasteries,<br/>
      and honor among householders.
    </li>
    <li>
      "Let both laymen and monks think<br/>
      that it was done by me.<br/>
      In every work, great and small,<br/>
      let them follow me" â€”<br/>
      such is the ambition of the fool;<br/>
      thus his desire and pride increase.
    </li>
    <li>
      One is the quest for worldly gain,<br/>
      and quite another is the path to Nibbana.<br/>
      Clearly understanding this,<br/>
      let not the monk, the disciple of the Buddha,<br/>
      be carried away by worldly acclaim,<br/>
      but develop detachment instead.
    </li>
    </ol>
