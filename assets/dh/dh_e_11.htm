      <li>
        When this world is ever ablaze,<br/>
        why this laughter,<br/>
        why this jubilation?<br/>
        Shrouded in darkness,<br/>
        will you not see the light?
      </li>
      <li>
        Behold this body — a painted image,<br/>
        a mass of heaped up sores,<br/>
        infirm, full of hankering —<br/>
        of which nothing is lasting or stable!
      </li>
      <li>
        Fully worn out is this body,<br/>
        a nest of disease, and fragile.<br/>
        This foul mass breaks up,<br/>
        for death is the end of life.
      </li>
      <li>
        These dove-colored bones are like gourds<br/>
        that lie scattered about in autumn.<br/>
        Having seen them, how can one seek delight?
      </li>
      <li>
        This city (body) is built of bones,<br/>
        plastered with flesh and blood;<br/>
        within are decay and death,<br/>
        pride and jealousy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even gorgeous royal chariots wear out,<br/>
        and indeed this body too wears out.<br/>
        But the Dhamma of the Good does not age;<br/>
        thus the Good make it known to the good.
      </li>
      <li>
        The man of little learning<br/>
        grows old like a bull.<br/>
        He grows only in bulk,<br/>
        but, his wisdom does not grow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Through many a birth in samsara<br/>
        have I wandered in vain,<br/>
        seeking the builder of this house (of life).<br/>
        Repeated birth is indeed suffering!
      </li>
      <li>
        O house-builder, you are seen!<br/>
        You will not build this house again.<br/>
        For your rafters are broken<br/>
        and your ridgepole shattered.<br/>
        My mind has reached the Unconditioned;<br/>
        I have attained the destruction of craving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those who in youth have not led the holy life,<br/>
        or have failed to acquire wealth,<br/>
        languish like old cranes in the pond without fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those who in youth have not lead the holy life,<br/>
        or have failed to acquire wealth,<br/>
        lie sighing over the past,<br/>
        like worn out arrows (shot from) a bow.
      </li>
    </ol>
