    <ol class="verse">
      <li>
        All tremble at violence;<br/>
        all fear death.<br/>
        Putting oneself in the place of another,<br/>
        one should not kill<br/>
        nor cause another to kill.
      </li>
      <li>
        All tremble at violence;<br/>
        life is dear to all.<br/>
        Putting oneself in the place of another,<br/>
        one should not kill<br/>
        nor cause another to kill.
      </li>
      <li>
        One who, while himself seeking happiness,<br/>
        oppresses with violence other beings<br/>
        who also desire happiness,<br/>
        will not attain happiness hereafter.
      </li>
      <li>
        One who, while himself seeking happiness,<br/>
        does not oppress with violence other beings<br/>
        who also desire happiness,<br/>
        will find happiness hereafter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Speak not harshly to anyone,<br/>
        for those thus spoken to might retort.<br/>
        Indeed, angry speech hurts,<br/>
        and retaliation may overtake you.
      </li>
      <li>
        If, like a broken gong,<br/>
        you silence yourself,<br/>
        you have approached Nibbana,<br/>
        for vindictiveness is no longer in you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as a cowherd<br/>
        drives the cattle to pasture with a staff,<br/>
        so do old age and death<br/>
        drive the life force of beings<br/>
        (from existence to existence).
      </li>
      <li>
        When the fool commits evil deeds,<br/>
        he does not realize (their evil nature).<br/>
        The witless man is tormented<br/>
        by his own deeds,<br/>
        like one burnt by fire.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who inflicts violence<br/>
        on those who are unarmed,<br/>
        and offends those who are inoffensive,<br/>
        will soon come upon one of these ten states:
      </li>
      <li>
        Sharp pain, or disaster, bodily injury,<br/>
        serious illness, or derangement of mind,<br/>
        trouble from the government, or grave charges,<br/>
        loss of relatives, or loss of wealth,<br/>
        or houses destroyed by ravaging fire;<br/>
        upon dissolution of the body<br/>
        that ignorant man is born in hell.
      </li>
      <li>
        Neither going about naked,<br/>
        nor matted locks, nor filth, nor fasting,<br/>
        nor lying on the ground,<br/>
        nor smearing oneself with ashes and dust,<br/>
        nor sitting on the heels (in penance)<br/>
        can purify a mortal<br/>
        who has not overcome doubt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even though he be well-attired,<br/>
        yet if he is poised, calm, controlled<br/>
        and established in the holy life,<br/>
        having set aside violence towards all beings â€”<br/>
        he, truly, is a holy man, a renunciate, a monk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only rarely is there a man in this world who,<br/>
        restrained by modesty, avoids reproach,<br/>
        as a thoroughbred horse avoids the whip.
      </li>
      <li>
        Like a thoroughbred horse touched by the whip,<br/>
        be strenuous, be filled with spiritual yearning.<br/>
        By faith and moral purity,<br/>
        by effort and meditation,<br/>
        by investigation of the truth,<br/>
        by being rich in knowledge and virtue,<br/>
        and by being mindful,<br/>
        destroy this unlimited suffering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Irrigators regulate the waters,<br/>
        fletchers straighten arrow shafts,<br/>
        carpenters shape wood,<br/>
        and the good control themselves.
      </li>
    </ol>
