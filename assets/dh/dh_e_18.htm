    <ol class="verse">
      <li>
        Like a withered leaf are you now;<br/>
        death's messengers await you.<br/>
        You stand on the eve of your departure,<br/>
        yet you have made no provision for your journey!
      </li>
      <li>
        Make an island for yourself!<br/>
        Strive hard and become wise!<br/>
        Rid of impurities and cleansed of stain,<br/>
        you shall enter the celestial abode of the Noble Ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your life has come to an end now;<br/>
        You are setting forth<br/>
        into the presence of Yama, the king of death.<br/>
        No resting place is there for you on the way,<br/>
        yet you have made no provision for the journey!
      </li>
      <li>
        Make an island unto yourself!<br/>
        Strive hard and become wise!<br/>
        Rid of impurities and cleansed of stain,<br/>
        you shall not come again to birth and decay.
      </li>
      <li>
        One by one, little by little, moment by moment,<br/>
        a wise man should remove his own impurities,<br/>
        as a smith removes his dross from silver.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as rust arising from iron<br/>
        eats away the base from which it arises,<br/>
        even so, their own deeds<br/>
        lead transgressors to states of woe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Non-repetition is the bane of scriptures;<br/>
        neglect is the bane of a home;<br/>
        slovenliness is the bane of personal appearance,<br/>
        and heedlessness is the bane of a guard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unchastity is the taint in a woman;<br/>
        niggardliness is the taint in a giver.<br/>
        Taints, indeed, are all evil things,<br/>
        both in this world and the next.
      </li>
      <li>
        A worse taint than these is ignorance,<br/>
        the worst of all taints.<br/>
        Destroy this one taint and become taintless, O monks!
      </li>
      <li>
        Easy is life for the shameless<br/>
        one who is impudent as a crow,<br/>
        is backbiting and forward,<br/>
        arrogant and corrupt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Difficult is life for the modest<br/>
        one who always seeks purity,<br/>
        is detached and unassuming,<br/>
        clean in life, and discerning.
      </li>
      <li>
        One who destroys life,<br/>
        utters lies,<br/>
        takes what is not given,<br/>
        goes to another man's wife,<br/>
        and is addicted to intoxicating drinks —<br/>
        such a man digs up his own root<br/>
        even in this world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Know this, O good man:<br/>
        evil things are difficult to control.<br/>
        Let not greed and wickedness<br/>
        drag you to protracted misery.
      </li>
      <li>
        People give according to their faith or regard.<br/>
        If one becomes discontented<br/>
        with the food and drink given by others,<br/>
        one does not attain meditative absorption,<br/>
        either by day or by night.
      </li>
      <li>
        But he in who this (discontent) is fully destroyed,<br/>
        uprooted and extinct,<br/>
        he attains absorption, both by day and by night.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no fire like lust;<br/>
        there is no grip like hatred;<br/>
        there is no net like delusion;<br/>
        there is no river like craving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Easily seen is the fault of others,<br/>
        but one's own fault is difficult to see.<br/>
        Like chaff one winnows another's faults,<br/>
        but hides one's own,<br/>
        even as a crafty fowler<br/>
        hides behind sham branches.
      </li>
      <li>
        He who seeks another's faults,<br/>
        who is ever censorious —<br/>
        his cankers grow.<br/>
        He is far from destruction of the cankers.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no track in the sky,<br/>
        and no recluse outside (the Buddha's dispensation).<br/>
        Mankind delights in worldliness,<br/>
        but the Buddhas are free from worldliness.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is not track in the sky,<br/>
        and no recluse outside (the Buddha's dispensation).<br/>
        There are no conditioned things<br/>
        that are eternal,<br/>
        and no instability in the Buddhas.
      </li>
