      <li>
        Better than a thousand useless words<br/>
        is one useful word,<br/>
        hearing which one attains peace.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better than a thousand useless verses<br/>
        is one useful verse,<br/>
        hearing which one attains peace.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better than reciting a hundred meaningless verses<br/>
        is the reciting of one verse of Dhamma,<br/>
        hearing which one attains peace.
      </li>
      <li>
        Though one may conquer a thousand times<br/>
        a thousand men in battle,<br/>
        yet he indeed is the noblest victor<br/>
        who conquers himself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Self-conquest is far better<br/>
        than the conquest of others.<br/>
        Not even a god, an angel, Mara or Brahma<br/>
        can turn into defeat the victory<br/>
        of a person who is self-subdued<br/>
        and ever restrained in conduct.
      </li>
      <li>
        Though month after month for a hundred years<br/>
        one should offer sacrifices by the thousands,<br/>
        yet if only for a moment<br/>
        one should worship those of perfected minds<br/>
        that honor is indeed better<br/>
        than a century of sacrifice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Though for a hundred years<br/>
        one should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest,<br/>
        yet if only for a moment<br/>
        one should worship those of perfected minds,<br/>
        that worship is indeed better<br/>
        than a century of sacrifice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whatever gifts and oblations<br/>
        one seeking merit<br/>
        might offer in this world for a whole year,<br/>
        all that is not worth one fourth of the merit<br/>
        gained by revering the Upright Ones,<br/>
        which is truly excellent.
      </li>
      <li>
        To one ever eager<br/>
        to revere and serve the elders,<br/>
        these four blessing accrue:<br/>
        long life and beauty, happiness and power.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better it is to live one day virtuous and meditative<br/>
        than to live a hundred years immoral and uncontrolled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better it is to live one day wise and meditative<br/>
        than to live a hundred years foolish and uncontrolled.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better it is to live one day strenuous and resolute<br/>
        than to live a hundred years sluggish and dissipated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better it is to live one day<br/>
        seeing the rise and fall of things<br/>
        than to live a hundred years<br/>
        without ever seeing the rise and fall of things.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better it is to live one day seeing the Deathless<br/>
        than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Deathless.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better it is to live one day seeing the Supreme Truth<br/>
        than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Supreme Truth.
