      <li>
        If one holds oneself dear,<br/>
        one should diligently watch oneself.<br/>
        Let the wise man keep vigil<br/>
        during any of the three watches of the night.
      </li>
      <li>
        One should first establish oneself<br/>
        in what is proper;<br/>
        then only should one instruct others.<br/>
        Thus the wise man will not be reproached.
      </li>
      <li>
        One should do what one teaches others to do;<br/>
        if one would train others,<br/>
        one should be well controlled oneself.<br/>
        Difficult, indeed, is self-control.
      </li>
      <li>
        One truly is the protector of oneself;<br/>
        who else could the protector be?<br/>
        With oneself fully controlled,<br/>
        one gains a mastery that is hard to gain.
      </li>
      <li>
        The evil a witless man does by himself,<br/>
        born of himself and produced by himself,<br/>
        grinds him as a diamond grinds a hard gem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just as a single creeper<br/>
        strangles the tree on which it grows,<br/>
        even so, a man who is exceedingly depraved<br/>
        harms himself as only an enemy might wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Easy to do are things<br/>
        that are bad and harmful to oneself.<br/>
        But exceedingly difficult to do<br/>
        are things that are good and beneficial.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whoever, on account of perverted views,<br/>
        scorns the Teaching of the Perfected Ones,<br/>
        the Noble and Righteous Ones â€”<br/>
        that fool, like the bamboo,<br/>
        produces fruits only for self destruction.
      </li>
      <li>
        By oneself is evil done;<br/>
        by oneself is one defiled.<br/>
        By oneself is evil left undone;<br/>
        by oneself is one made pure.<br/>
        Purity and impurity depended on oneself;<br/>
        no one can purify another.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let one not neglect one's own welfare<br/>
        for the sake of another, however great.<br/>
        Clearly understanding one's own welfare,<br/>
        let one be intent upon the good.
      </li>
