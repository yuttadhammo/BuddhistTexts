      <li>
        Hasten to do good;<br/>
        restrain your mind from evil.<br/>
        He who is slow in doing good,<br/>
        his mind delights in evil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Should a person commit evil,<br/>
        let him not do it again and again.<br/>
        Let him not find pleasure therein,<br/>
        for painful is the accumulation of evil.

        Should a person do good,<br/>
        let him do it again and again.<br/>
        Let him find pleasure therein,<br/>
        for blissful is the accumulation of good.
      </li>
      <li>
        It may be well with the evil-doer<br/>
        as long as the evil ripens not.<br/>
        But when it does ripen,<br/>
        then the evil-doer sees<br/>
        (the painful results of) his evil deeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        It may be ill with the doer of good<br/>
        as long as the good ripens not.<br/>
        But when it does ripen,<br/>
        then the doer of good sees<br/>
        (the pleasant results of) his good deeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Think not lightly of evil, saying,<br/>
        "It will not come to me."<br/>
        Drop by drop is the water pot filled.<br/>
        Likewise, the fool,<br/>
        gathering it little by little,<br/>
        fills himself with evil.

        fills himself with good.

      <li>
        Just as a trader<br/>
        with a small escort and great wealth<br/>
        would avoid a perilous route,<br/>
        or just as one desiring to live avoids poison,<br/>
        even so should one shun evil.
      </li>
      <li>
        If on the hand there is no wound,<br/>
        one may carry even poison in it.<br/>
        Poison does not affect one who is free from wounds.<br/>
        For him who does no evil,<br/>
        there is no ill.
      </li>
      <li>
        Like fine dust thrown against the wind,<br/>
        evil falls back upon that fool<br/>
        who offends an inoffensive, pure and guiltless man.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some are born in the womb;<br/>
        the wicked are born in hell;<br/>
        the devout go to heaven;<br/>
        the stainless pass into Nibbana.
      </li>
      <li>
        Neither in the sky nor in mid-ocean,<br/>
        nor by entering into mountain clefts,<br/>
        nowhere in the world is there a place<br/>
        where one may escape<br/>
        from the results of evil deeds.

        where one will not be overcome by death.
