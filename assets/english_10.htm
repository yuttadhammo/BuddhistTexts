<DIV style="position:absolute;top:313;left:140"><nobr><span class="ft3490">[(1) LOVING-KINDNESS]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:335;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3497">1.&nbsp;[295] The four divine abidings were mentioned next to the recollections as<br>meditation subjects (III.105). They are loving-kindness, compassion, gladness<br>and equanimity. A meditator, who wants to develop firstly loving-kindness<br>among these, if he is a beginner, should sever the impediments and learn the<br>meditation subject. Then, when he has done the work&nbsp;connected with the meal<br>and got rid of any dizziness due to it, he should seat himself comfortably on a<br>well-prepared seat in a secluded place. To start with, he should review the<br>danger in hate and the advantage in patience.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:479;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3490">2.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:479;left:98"><nobr><span class="ft3490">Why? Because hate has to be abandoned and patience attained in the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:496;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3497">development of this meditation subject, and he cannot abandon unseen dangers<br>and attain unknown advantages.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:536;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft3490">Now,&nbsp;the danger in hate should be seen in accordance with such suttas as</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:553;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3497">this: “Friends, when a man hates, is a prey to hate and his mind is obsessed by<br>hate, he kills living things, and …” (A I 216). And the advantage in patience<br>should be understood according to such suttas as these:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:610;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft3497">“No higher rule, the Buddhas say,&nbsp;than patience,<br>And no Nibbāna higher than forbearance” (D&nbsp;II&nbsp;49; Dhp 184);</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:649;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft3497">“Patience in force,&nbsp;in strong array:<br>’Tis him I call a brahman” (Dhp 399);</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:688;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft3490">“No greater thing exists than patience” (S I 222).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:710;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3497">3.&nbsp;Thereupon he should embark upon the development of loving-kindness for<br>the purpose of secluding the mind from hate seen as a danger and introducing<br>it to patience known as an advantage.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:767;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft3490">But when he begins, he must know&nbsp;that some persons are of the wrong sort at</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:784;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3497">the very beginning and that loving-kindness should be developed towards<br>certain kinds of persons and not towards certain other kinds at&nbsp;first. [296]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:824;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3497">4.&nbsp;For loving-kindness should not be developed at&nbsp;first towards the following<br>four kinds of persons: an antipathetic person, a very dearly loved friend, a neutral<br>person, and a hostile person. Also it should not be developed specifically (see<br>§49) towards the opposite sex, or towards a dead person.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:53;left:379"><nobr><span class="ft3502"><i>Part 2: Concentration (Samādhi)</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:917;left:308"><nobr><span class="ft3500">292</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3500">5.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:89"><nobr><span class="ft3500">What is the reason why it should not be developed at&nbsp;first towards an</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:105;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3505">antipathetic person and the others? To put an antipathetic person in a dear<br>one’s place is fatiguing. To put a very dearly loved friend in a neutral person’s<br>place is fatiguing; and if the slightest mischance befalls the friend, he feels like<br>weeping. To put a neutral person in a respected one’s or a dear one’s place is<br>fatiguing. Anger springs up in him if he recollects a hostile person. That is why<br>it should not be developed at&nbsp;first towards an antipathetic person and the rest.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:214;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3505">6.&nbsp;Then, if he develops it specifically towards the opposite sex, lust inspired by<br>that person springs up in him. An elder supported by&nbsp;a family was asked, it<br>seems, by&nbsp;a friend’s son, “Venerable sir, towards whom should loving-kindness<br>be developed?” The elder told him, “Towards a person one loves.” He loved his<br>own wife.&nbsp;Through developing loving-kindness towards her he was fighting<br>against the wall all the night.1&nbsp;That is why it should not be developed specifically<br>towards the opposite sex.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:341;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3505">7.&nbsp;But if he develops it towards a dead person, he reaches neither absorption<br>nor access. A young bhikkhu, it seems, had started developing loving-kindness<br>inspired by&nbsp;his teacher. His loving-kindness made no headway&nbsp;at&nbsp;all. He went to<br>a senior elder and told him, “Venerable sir, I am quite familiar with attaining<br>jhāna through loving-kindness, and yet I cannot attain it. What is the matter?”<br>The elder said, “Seek the sign, friend, [the object of your meditation].” He did so.<br>Finding that his teacher had died, he proceeded with developing loving-kindness<br>inspired by&nbsp;another and attained absorption. That is why it should not be<br>developed towards one who is dead.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:502;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3505">8.&nbsp;First of all it should be developed only towards oneself, doing it repeatedly<br>thus: “May I be happy and free from suffering” or “May I keep myself free from<br>enmity, affliction and anxiety and live&nbsp;happily.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:558;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3505">9.&nbsp;If that is so, does it not conflict with what&nbsp;is said in the texts? For there is no<br>mention of any development of it towards oneself in what&nbsp;is said in the Vibhaṅga:<br>“And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart filled<br>with loving-kindness? Just as he would feel loving-kindness on seeing a dearly<br>loved person, so he pervades all beings with loving-kindness” (Vibh 272); and<br>in what&nbsp;is said in the Paṭisambhidā: “In what&nbsp;five&nbsp;ways is the mind-deliverance<br>of loving-kindness [practiced] with unspecified pervasion? May all beings be<br>free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live&nbsp;happily. May all breathing things<br>[297] … all who are born … all persons … all those who have&nbsp;a personality be<br>free from enmity, affliction and anxiety and live&nbsp;happily” (Paṭis II 130); and in<br>what&nbsp;is said in the Mettā Sutta: “In joy and safety may all beings be joyful at<br>heart” (Sn 145). [Does it not conflict with those texts?]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:814;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3504">1.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:814;left:87"><nobr><span class="ft3504">“‘Fighting against the wall’: having undertaken the precepts of virtue and sat</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:830;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3506">down on a seat in his room with the door locked, he was developing loving-kindness.<br>Blinded by&nbsp;lust arisen under cover of the loving-kindness, he wanted to go to his wife,<br>and without noticing the door he beat on the wall in his desire to get out even by<br>breaking the wall down” (Vism-mhṭ 286).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:53;left:457"><nobr><span class="ft3512"><i>The Divine Abidings</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:917;left:317"><nobr><span class="ft3510">293</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3510">10.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:104"><nobr><span class="ft3510">It does not conflict. Why not? Because that refers to absorption. But this</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:105;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3516">[initial development towards oneself] refers to [making oneself] an example.&nbsp;For<br>even if he developed loving-kindness for a hundred or a thousand years in this<br>way,&nbsp;“I am happy” and so on, absorption would never arise. But if he develops it<br>in this way: “I am happy.&nbsp;Just as I want to be happy and dread pain, as I want to<br>live&nbsp;and not to die, so do other beings, too,” making himself the example, then<br>desire for other beings’ welfare and happiness arises in him. And this method is<br>indicated by&nbsp;the Blessed One’s saying:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft3516">I visited all quarters with my mind<br>Nor found I any dearer than myself;<br>Self is likewise to every other dear;<br>Who loves himself will never harm another (S I 75; Ud 47).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:306;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3516">11.&nbsp;So he should first, as example, pervade himself with loving-kindness. Next<br>after that, in order to proceed easily, he can recollect such gifts,2&nbsp;kind words, etc.,<br>as inspire love&nbsp;and endearment, such virtue, learning, etc., as inspire respect<br>and reverence met with in a teacher or his equivalent or a preceptor or his<br>equivalent, developing loving-kindness towards him in the way beginning, “May<br>this good man be happy and free from suffering.” With such a person, of course,<br>he attains absorption.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:432;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3516">12.&nbsp;But if this bhikkhu does not rest content with just that much and wants to<br>break down the barriers, he should next, after that, develop loving-kindness<br>towards a very dearly loved friend, then towards a neutral person as a very<br>dearly loved friend, then towards a hostile person as neutral. And while he does<br>so, he should make his mind malleable and wieldy in each instance before<br>passing on to the next.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:541;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3516">13.&nbsp;But if he has no enemy, or he is of the type of a great man who does not<br>perceive&nbsp;another as an enemy even when the other does him harm, he should<br>not interest himself as follows: “Now&nbsp;that my consciousness of loving-kindness<br>has become wieldy towards a neutral person, I shall apply it to a hostile one.”<br>[298] Rather it was about one who actually has an enemy that it was said above<br>that he should develop loving-kindness towards a hostile person as neutral.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:660;left:245"><nobr><span class="ft3512"><i>[Getting Rid of Resentment]</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:690;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3516">14.&nbsp;If resentment arises in him when he applies his mind to a hostile person<br>because he remembers wrongs done by&nbsp;that person, he should get rid of the<br>resentment by&nbsp;entering repeatedly into loving-kindness [jhāna] towards any of<br>the first-mentioned persons and then, after he has emerged each time, directing<br>loving-kindness towards that person.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:781;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3510">15.&nbsp;But if it does not die out in spite of his efforts, then:</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:350;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft3520">And this: “Bhikkhus, there are seven things gratifying and helpful to an</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:367;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3525">enemy that happen to one who is angry, whether woman or man. What seven?<br>Here, bhikkhus, an enemy wishes thus for his enemy, ‘Let him be ugly!’ Why is<br>that? An enemy does not delight in an enemy’s beauty. Now,&nbsp;this angry person<br>is a prey to anger, ruled by&nbsp;anger; though well bathed, well anointed, with hair<br>and beard trimmed and clothed in white,&nbsp;yet he is ugly, being a prey to anger.<br>This is the first thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is<br>angry, whether woman or man.

An enemy does not delight in an enemy’s going to a<br>happy destiny. Now,&nbsp;this angry person is a prey to anger, ruled by&nbsp;anger; he<br>misconducts himself in body, speech and mind. Misconducting himself thus in<br>body, speech and mind, on the breakup of the body, after death, he reappears in<br>a state of loss, in an unhappy destiny, in perdition, in hell, being a prey to anger”<br>(A IV 94).? And this: “As a log from a pyre, burnt at&nbsp;both ends and fouled in the<br>middle, serves neither for timber in the village nor for timber in the forest, so is<br>such a person as this I say” (A II 95, It 90)?. “If you are angry now,&nbsp;you will be one<br>who does not carry out the Blessed One’s teaching; by repaying an angry man<br>in kind you will be worse than the angry man and not win the battle hard to win;<br>you will yourself do to yourself the things that help your enemy; and you will be<br>like a pyre log.” (<i>Source untraced</i>)</span></nobr></DIV>

Then the latter should be ignored and the<br>control in his mental behaviour remembered.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:432;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3536">20.&nbsp;But there may be another in whom not even one of these three things is<br>controlled. Then compassion for that person should be aroused thus: “Though<br>he is going about in the human world now,&nbsp;nevertheless after a certain number<br>of days he will find himself in [one of] the eight great hells or the sixteen<br>prominent hells.4” For irritation subsides too through compassion. In yet another<br>all three may be controlled. Then he can remember any of the three in that<br>person, whichever he likes; for the development of loving-kindness towards<br>such a person is easy.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:576;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3536">21.&nbsp;And in order to make the meaning of this clear the following sutta from the<br>Book of Fives should be cited in full: “Bhikkhus, there are five&nbsp;ways of dispelling<br>annoyance whereby annoyance arisen in a bhikkhu can be entirely dispelled”<br>(A III 186–90).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:650;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3530">22.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:650;left:105"><nobr><span class="ft3530">But if irritation still arises in him in spite of his efforts, then he should</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:667;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3530">admonish himself thus:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:689;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft3536">Suppose an enemy has hurt<br>You now in what&nbsp;is his domain,<br>Why try yourself as well to hurt<br>Your mind?—That is not his domain.</span></nobr></DIV>

Again when he was<br>buried, along with a thousand companions, up to the neck in a hole dug in the<br>earth in a charnel ground, he had no thought of hate. And when, after saving<br>his life by&nbsp;a heroic effort helped by&nbsp;jackals scraping away&nbsp;soil when they had<br>come to devour the corpses, he went with the aid of a spirit to his own bedroom<br>and saw his enemy lying on his own bed, he was not angry but treated him as a<br>friend, undertaking a mutual pledge, and he then exclaimed:</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:345;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3586">36.&nbsp;But if, as he reviews the special qualities of the Master’s former conduct,<br>the resentment still does not subside in him, since he has long been used to the<br>slavery of defilement, then he should review the suttas that deal with the<br>beginninglessness [of the round of rebirths]. Here is what&nbsp;is said: “Bhikkhus, it<br>is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father<br>… your brother … your sister … your son … your daughter” (S II 189–90).<br>Consequently he should think about that person thus: “This person, it seems, as<br>my mother in the past carried me in her womb for ten months and removed from<br>me without disgust, as if it were yellow sandalwood, my urine, excrement, spittle,<br>snot, etc., and played with me in her lap,&nbsp;and nourished me, carrying me about<br>on her hip. And this person as my father went by&nbsp;goat paths and paths set on<br>piles,5&nbsp;etc., to pursue the trade of merchant, and he risked his life for me by&nbsp;going<br>into battle in double array, by&nbsp;sailing on the great ocean in ships and doing other<br>difficult things, and he nourished me by&nbsp;bringing back wealth by&nbsp;one means or<br>another thinking to feed his children. And as my brother, sister, son, daughter,<br>this person gave&nbsp;me such and such help. So it is unbecoming for me to harbour<br>hate for him in my mind.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:645;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3586">37.&nbsp;But if he is still unable to quench that thought in this way,&nbsp;then he should<br>review the advantages of loving-kindness thus: “Now,&nbsp;you who have&nbsp;gone forth<br>into homelessness, has it not been said by&nbsp;the Blessed One as follows: ‘Bhikkhus,<br>when the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is cultivated, developed, much<br>practiced, made the vehicle, made the foundation, established, consolidated,<br>and properly undertaken, eleven blessings can be expected. What are the eleven?<br>A man sleeps in comfort, wakes in comfort, and dreams no evil dreams, he is<br>dear to human beings, he is dear to non-human beings, deities guard him, fire<br>and poison and weapons do not affect him, his mind is easily concentrated, the<br>expression of his face is serene, he dies unconfused, if he penetrates no higher</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3593">he will be reborn in the Brahmā-world’ (A V 342). [306] If you do not stop this<br>thought, you will be denied these advantages.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:127;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3593">38.&nbsp;But if he is still unable to stop it in this way,&nbsp;he should try resolution into<br>elements. How? “Now,&nbsp;you who have&nbsp;gone forth into homelessness, when you<br>are angry with him, what&nbsp;is it you are angry with? Is it head hairs you are angry<br>with? Or body hairs? Or nails? … Or is it urine you are angry with? Or<br>alternatively, is it the earth element in the head hairs, etc., you are angry with? Or<br>the water element? Or the fire element? Or is it the air element you are angry<br>with? Or among the five&nbsp;aggregates or the twelve bases or the eighteen elements<br>with respect to which this venerable one is called by&nbsp;such and such a name,<br>which then, is it the materiality aggregate you are angry with? Or the feeling<br>aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, the consciousness<br>aggregate you are angry with? Or is it the eye base you are angry with? Or the<br>visible-object base you are angry with? … Or the mind base you are angry with?<br>Or the mental-object base you are angry with? Or is it the eye element you are<br>angry with? Or the visible-object element? Or the eye-consciousness element? …<br>Or the mind element? Or the mental-object element? Or the mind-consciousness<br>element you are angry with?” For when he tries the resolution into elements, his<br>anger finds no foothold, like a mustard seed on the point of an awl or a painting<br>on the air.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:445;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3593">39.&nbsp;But if he cannot effect the resolution into elements, he should try the giving<br>of a gift. It can either be given by&nbsp;himself to the other or accepted by&nbsp;himself from<br>the other. But if the other’s livelihood is not purified and his requisites are not<br>proper to be used, it should be given by&nbsp;oneself. And in the one who does this the<br>annoyance with that person entirely subsides. And in the other even anger that<br>has been dogging him from a past birth subsides at&nbsp;the moment, as happened to<br>the senior elder who received a bowl given to him at&nbsp;the Cittalapabbata<br>Monastery by&nbsp;an almsfood-eater elder who had been three times made to move<br>from his lodging by&nbsp;him, and who presented it with these words: “Venerable sir,<br>this bowl worth eight ducats was given me by&nbsp;my mother who is a lay devotee,<br>and it is rightly obtained; let the good lay devotee acquire merit.” So efficacious<br>is this act of giving. And this is said:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:658;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft3593">A gift for taming the untamed,<br>A gift for every kind of good;<br>Through giving gifts they do unbend<br>And condescend to kindly speech. [307]</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:772;left:105"><nobr><span class="ft3590">When his resentment towards that hostile person has been thus allayed,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:789;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3593">then he can turn his mind with loving-kindness towards that person too, just as<br>towards the one who is dear, the very dear friend, and the neutral person.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3603">41.&nbsp;The characteristic of it is this.&nbsp;Suppose this person is sitting in a place with<br>a dear, a neutral, and a hostile person, himself being the fourth; then bandits<br>come to him and say,&nbsp;“Venerable sir, give&nbsp;us a bhikkhu,” and on being asked<br>why,&nbsp;they answer, “So that we&nbsp;may kill him and use the blood of his throat as an<br>offering;” then if that bhikkhu thinks, “Let them take this one, or this one,” he<br>has not broken down the barriers. And also if he thinks, “Let them take me but<br>not these three,” he has not broken down the barriers either. Why? Because he<br>seeks the harm of him whom he wishes to be taken and seeks the welfare of the<br>other only. But it is when he does not see a single one among the four people to<br>be given to the bandits and he directs his mind impartially towards himself and<br>towards those three people that he has broken down the barriers. Hence the<br>Ancients said:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:301;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3600">42.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:301;left:171"><nobr><span class="ft3603">When he discriminates between<br>The four, that is himself, the dear,<br>The neutral, and the hostile one,<br>Then “skilled” is not the name he gets,<br>Nor “having amity at&nbsp;will,”<br>But only “kindly towards beings.”<br>Now,&nbsp;when a bhikkhu’s barriers<br>Have&nbsp;all the four been broken down,<br>He treats with equal amity<br>The whole world with its deities;<br>Far more distinguished than the first<br>Is he who knows no barriers.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:532;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3603">with the breaking down of the barriers. But when breaking down of the barriers<br>has been effected, he reaches absorption in the way described under the earth<br>kasiṇa without trouble by&nbsp;cultivating, developing, and repeatedly practicing<br>that same sign.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:606;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft3600">At&nbsp;this point he has attained the first jhāna, which abandons five&nbsp;factors,</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:725;left:245"><nobr><span class="ft3602"><i>[Texts and Commentary]</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:755;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3603">44.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;it is by&nbsp;means of one of these jhānas beginning with the first that he<br>“Dwells pervading (intent upon) one direction with his heart endued with loving-<br>kindness, likewise the second direction, likewise the third direction, likewise<br>the fourth direction, and so above, below,&nbsp;and around; everywhere and equally<br>he dwells pervading the entire world with his heart endued with loving-<br>kindness, abundant, exalted, measureless, free from enmity,&nbsp;and free from<br>affliction” (Vibh 272; D I 250).

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:104"><nobr><span class="ft3612"><i>So above</i>: in that same way in the upper direction is what&nbsp;is meant.&nbsp;<i>Below,</i></span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:564;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft3660">But if he does not encounter such a person, then he can arouse compassion</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:581;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3663">for an evil-doing person, even though he is happy,&nbsp;by&nbsp;comparing him to one<br>about to be executed. How?</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:620;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3660">79.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:620;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft3660">Suppose a robber has been caught with stolen goods, and in accordance</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:638;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3663">with the king’s command to execute him, the king’s men bind him and lead him<br>off to the place of execution, giving him a hundred blows in sets of four. Then<br>people give&nbsp;him things to chew and eat and also garlands and perfumes,<br>unguents and betel leaves.&nbsp;Although [315] he goes along eating and enjoying<br>these things as though he were happy and well off, still no one fancies that&nbsp;he is<br>really happy and well off. On the contrary people feel compassion for him,<br>thinking, “This poor wretch is now about to die; every step he takes brings him<br>nearer to the presence of death.” So too a bhikkhu whose meditation subject is<br>compassion should arouse compassion for an [evil-doing] person even if he is<br>happy: “Though this poor wretch is now happy,&nbsp;cheerful, enjoying his wealth,<br>still for want of even one good deed done now in any one of the three doors [of<br>body, speech and mind] he can come to experience untold suffering in the states<br>of loss.”</span></nobr></DIV>
