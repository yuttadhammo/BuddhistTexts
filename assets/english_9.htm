<DIV style="position:absolute;top:331;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft28310">1.&nbsp;[229] Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness of death,<br>which was listed next (III.105).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:380;left:289"><nobr><span class="ft2837"><i>[Definitions]</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:410;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft28310">Herein,&nbsp;<i>death&nbsp;</i>(<i>maraṇa</i>) is the interruption of the life faculty included within [the<br>limits of] a single becoming (existence). But death as termination (cutting off), in<br>other words, the Arahant’s termination of the suffering of the round, is not<br>intended here, nor is momentary death, in other words, the momentary dissolution<br>of formations, nor the “death” of conventional (metaphorical) usage in such<br>expressions as “dead tree,” “dead metal,” and so on.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:519;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft28310">2.&nbsp;As intended here it is of two kinds, that is to say,&nbsp;timely death and untimely<br>death. Herein,&nbsp;<i>timely death&nbsp;</i>comes about with the exhaustion of merit or with the<br>exhaustion of a life span or with both.&nbsp;<i>Untimely death&nbsp;</i>comes about through<br>kamma that interrupts [other, life-producing] kamma.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:593;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft28310">3.&nbsp;Herein, death through&nbsp;<i>exhaustion of merit&nbsp;</i>is a term for the kind of death that<br>comes about owing to the result of [former] rebirth-producing kamma’s having<br>finished ripening although favourable conditions for prolonging the continuity<br>of a life span may be still present. Death through&nbsp;<i>exhaustion of a life span&nbsp;</i>is a term<br>for the kind of death that comes about owing to the exhaustion of the normal life<br>span of men of today,&nbsp;which measures only a century owing to want of such<br>excellence in destiny [as deities have] or in time [as there is at&nbsp;the beginning of<br>an aeon] or in nutriment [as the Uttarakurus and so on have].1&nbsp;<i>Untimely death&nbsp;</i>is<br>a term for the death of those whose continuity is interrupted by&nbsp;kamma capable<br>of causing them to fall (<i>cāvana</i>) from their place at&nbsp;that very moment, as in the<br>case of Dūsi-Māra (see M I 337), Kalāburājā (see J-a III 39), etc.,2&nbsp;or for the death<br>of those whose [life’s] continuity is interrupted by&nbsp;assaults with weapons, etc.,<br>due to previous kamma.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:167;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2846">4.&nbsp;One who wants to develop this should go into solitary retreat and exercise<br>attention wisely in this way: “Death will take place; the life faculty will be<br>interrupted,” or “Death, death.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:224;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2846">5.&nbsp;If he exercises his attention unwisely in recollecting the [possible] death of<br>an agreeable person, sorrow&nbsp;arises, as in a mother on recollecting the death of<br>her beloved child she bore; and gladness arises in recollecting the death of a<br>disagreeable person, as in enemies on recollecting the death of their enemies;<br>and no sense of urgency arises on recollecting the death of neutral people, as<br>happens in a corpse-burner on seeing a dead body; and anxiety arises on<br>recollecting one’s own death, as happens in a timid person on seeing a murderer<br>with a poised dagger.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:367;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2846">6.&nbsp;In all that there is neither mindfulness nor sense of urgency nor knowledge. So<br>he should look here and there at&nbsp;beings that have&nbsp;been killed or have&nbsp;died, and<br>advert to the death of beings already dead but formerly seen enjoying good things,<br>doing so with mindfulness, with a sense of urgency and with knowledge, after<br>which he can exercise his attention in the way beginning, “Death will take place.”<br>By so doing he exercises it wisely. He exercises it as a [right] means, is the meaning.3</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:476;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2846">7.&nbsp;When some exercise it merely in this way,&nbsp;their hindrances get suppressed,<br>their mindfulness becomes established with death as its object, and the meditation<br>subject reaches access.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:573;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2846">8.&nbsp;But one who finds that it does not get so far should do his recollecting of<br>death in eight ways, that is to say: (1) as having the appearance of a murderer, (2)<br>as the ruin of success, (3) by&nbsp;comparison, (4) as to sharing the body with many,<br>(5) as to the frailty of life,&nbsp;(6) as signless, (7) as to the limitedness of the extent, (8)<br>as to the shortness of the moment.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:664;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2846">9.&nbsp;<i>1.</i>&nbsp;Herein,&nbsp;<i>as having the appearance of a murderer</i>: he should do his recollecting<br>thus, “Just as a murderer appears with a sword, thinking, ‘I shall cut this man’s<br>head off,’ and applies it to his neck, so death appears.” Why? Because it comes<br>with birth and it takes away&nbsp;life.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:738;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2846">10.&nbsp;As budding toadstools always come up lifting dust on their tops, so beings<br>are born along with aging and death. For accordingly their rebirth-linking<br>consciousness reaches aging immediately next to its arising and then breaks<br>up together with its associated aggregates, like a stone that falls from the summit<br>of a rock. [231] So to begin with, momentary death comes along with birth. But<br>death is inevitable for what&nbsp;is born; consequently the kind of death intended<br>here also comes along with birth.</span></nobr></DIV>

Hence it is said:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:197;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft2855">“Right from the very day a man<br>Has been conceived inside a womb<br>He cannot but go on and on,<br>Nor going can he once turn back” (J-a IV 494).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:271;left:105"><nobr><span class="ft2850">And whilst he goes on thus death is as near to him as drying up is to</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:288;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2855">rivulets in the summer heat, as falling is to the fruits of trees when the sap<br>reaches their attachments in the morning, as breaking is to clay pots tapped by<br>a mallet, as vanishing is to dewdrops touched by&nbsp;the sun’s rays. Hence it is said:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:345;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft2855">“The nights and days go slipping by<br>As life keeps dwindling steadily<br>Till mortals’ span, like water pools<br>In failing rills, is all used up” (S I 109).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:419;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft2855">“As there is fear, when fruits are ripe,<br>That in the morning they will fall,<br>So mortals are in constant fear,<br>When they are born, that they will die.<br>And as the fate of pots of clay<br>Once fashioned by the potter’s hand,<br>Or small or big or baked or raw,4<br>Condemns them to be broken up,<br>So mortals’ life leads but to death” (Sn p.&nbsp;576f.).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:580;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft2855">“The dewdrop on the blade of grass<br>Vanishes when the sun comes up;<br>Such is a human span of life;<br>So, mother, do not hinder me” (J-a IV 122).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:654;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2855">13.&nbsp;So this death, which comes along with birth, is like a murderer with poised<br>sword. And like the murderer who applies the sword to the neck, it carries off life<br>and never returns to bring it back. [232] That is why,&nbsp;since death appears like&nbsp;a<br>murderer with poised sword owing to its coming along with birth and carrying<br>off life,&nbsp;it should be recollected as “having the appearance of a murderer.”</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:303;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft2923">Something may be said about the word&nbsp;<i>paññatti</i>&nbsp;here. Twenty-four kinds are dealt</span></nobr></DIV>

(Pug 1) The commentary explains the<br>word in this sense as&nbsp;<i>paññāpana</i>&nbsp;(making known) and&nbsp;<i>ṭhapana</i>&nbsp;(placing), quoting “He<br>announces, teaches, declares (<i>paññāpeti</i>), establishes” (cf. M III 248), and also “a well-<br>appointed (<i>supaññatta</i>) bed and chair” (?).

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:465;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft2923">It then gives six kinds of&nbsp;<i>paññatti</i>&nbsp;“according to the commentarial method but not</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:481;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2926">in the texts”: (1)&nbsp;<i>Concept of the existent</i>&nbsp;(<i>vijjamāna-paññatti</i>), which is the conceptualizing<br>of (making known) a dhamma that is existent, actual, become, in the true and ultimate<br>sense (e.g. aggregates, etc.). (2)&nbsp;<i>Concept of the non-existent</i>, which is, for example, the<br>conceptualizing of “female,” “male,” “persons,” etc., which are non-existent by&nbsp;that<br>standard and are only established by&nbsp;means of current speech in the world; similarly<br>“such impossibilities as concepts of a fifth truth or the other sectarians’ Atom,<br>Primordial Essence, World Soul, and the like.” (3)&nbsp;<i>Concept of the non-existent based on<br>the existent</i>, e.g. the expression, “One with the three clear-visions,” where the “person”<br>(“one”) is nonexistent and the “clear-visions” are existent. (4)<i>&nbsp;Concept of the existent<br>based on the non-existent</i>, e.g. the “female form,” “visible form” (= visible datum base)<br>being existent and “female” non-existent. (5)&nbsp;<i>Concept of the existent</i>&nbsp;based on the<br>existent, e.g. “eye-contact,” both “eye” and “contact” being existent.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:145;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2953">43.&nbsp;Herein, the three, that is to say,&nbsp;the sections on postures, on the four kinds of<br>full awareness (see M-a I 253f.), and on attention directed to elements, as they are<br>stated [in that sutta], deal with insight. Then the nine sections on the charnel-<br>ground contemplations, as stated there, deal with that particular phase of insight<br>knowledge called contemplation of danger. And any development of<br>concentration in the bloated, etc., that might be implied there has already been<br>explained in the Description of Foulness (Ch. VI). So there are only the two,&nbsp;that<br>is, the sections on breathing and on directing attention to repulsiveness, that, as<br>stated there, deal with concentration. Of these two,&nbsp;the section on breathing is a<br>separate meditation subject, namely, mindfulness of breathing.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:363;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2953">44.&nbsp;What is intended here as mindfulness occupied with the body is the thirty-<br>two aspects. This meditation subject is taught as the direction of attention to<br>repulsiveness thus: “Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this body, up from the<br>soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and contained in the skin, as<br>full of many kinds of filth thus: In this body there are head hairs, body hairs,<br>nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidney,&nbsp;heart, liver,&nbsp;midriff,<br>spleen, lungs, bowels, entrails, gorge, dung, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat,<br>tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine” (M III 90), the brain being<br>included in the bone marrow&nbsp;in this version [with a total of only thirty-one aspects].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:524;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2953">45.&nbsp;Here is the description of the development introduced by&nbsp;a commentary on<br>the text.</span></nobr></DIV>

For the meditation subject only becomes<br>evident to some through recitation, as it did to the two elders who learned the<br>meditation subject from the Elder Mahā Deva&nbsp;of the Hill Country (Malaya). On<br>being asked for the meditation subject, it seems, the elder [242] gave&nbsp;the text of<br>the thirty-two aspects, saying, “Do only this recitation for four months.”<br>Although they were familiar respectively with two and three Piṭakas, it was only<br>at&nbsp;the end of four months of recitation of the meditation subject that they became<br>stream-enterers, with right apprehension [of the text].

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2993">out any [parts] that do not appear to him. For when a beginner gives his attention<br>to head hairs, his attention then carries on till it arrives at&nbsp;the last part, that is,<br>urine and stops there; and when he gives his attention to urine, his attention<br>then carries on till it arrives back at&nbsp;the first part, that is, head hairs, and stops<br>there. As he persists in giving his attention thus, some parts appear to him and<br>others do not. Then he should work&nbsp;on those that have&nbsp;appeared till one out of<br>any two appears the clearer. He should arouse absorption by&nbsp;again and again<br>giving attention to the one that has appeared thus.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:393;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2993">68.&nbsp;Here is a simile. Suppose a hunter wanted to catch a monkey&nbsp;that lived in a<br>grove of thirty-two palms, and he shot an arrow&nbsp;through a leaf of the palm that<br>stood at&nbsp;the beginning and gave&nbsp;a shout; then the monkey&nbsp;went leaping<br>successively from palm to palm till it reached the last palm; and when the<br>hunter went there too and did as before, it came back in like manner to the first<br>palm; and being followed thus again and again, after leaping from each place<br>where a shout was given, it eventually jumped on to one palm, and firmly seizing<br>the palm shoot’s leaf spike in the middle, would not leap any more even when<br>shot—so it is with this.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:554;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2993">69.&nbsp;The application of the simile is this. The thirty-two parts of the body are like<br>the thirty-two palms in the grove.&nbsp;The monkey&nbsp;is like the mind. The meditator is<br>like the hunter. The range of the meditator’s mind in the body with its thirty-two<br>parts as object is like the monkey’s inhabiting the palm grove of thirty-two<br>palms. The settling down of the meditator’s mind in the last part after going<br>successively [from part to part] when he began by&nbsp;giving his attention to head<br>hairs is like the monkey’s leaping from palm to palm and going to the last palm,<br>[246] when the hunter shot an arrow&nbsp;through the leaf of the palm where it was<br>and gave&nbsp;a shout. Likewise in the return to the beginning. His doing the<br>preliminary work&nbsp;on those parts that have&nbsp;appeared, leaving behind those that<br>did not appear while, as he gave&nbsp;his attention to them again and again, some<br>appeared to him and some did not, is like the monkey’s being followed and<br>leaping up from each place where a shout is given. The meditator’s repeated<br>attention given to the part that in the end appears the more clearly of any two<br>that have&nbsp;appeared to him and his finally reaching absorption, is like the<br>monkey’s eventually stopping in one palm, firmly seizing the palm shoot’s leaf<br>spike in the middle and not leaping up even when shot.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:854;left:104"><nobr><span class="ft2990">There is another simile too. Suppose an alms-food-eater bhikkhu went to</span></nobr></DIV>

They are bounded above&nbsp;by&nbsp;space, and all round by&nbsp;each<br>other. There are no two hairs together.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:660;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3026">85.&nbsp;For on seeing the colour of a head hair in a bowl of inviting rice gruel or<br>cooked rice, people are disgusted and say,&nbsp;“This has got hairs in it. Take it<br>away.” So they are repulsive&nbsp;in&nbsp;<i>colour</i>. Also when people are eating at&nbsp;night, they<br>are likewise disgusted by&nbsp;the mere sensation of a hair-shaped&nbsp;<i>akka</i>-bark or&nbsp;<i>makaci</i>-<br>bark fibre.

And<br>it is sublime, something one cannot have&nbsp;enough of, both on account of the<br>sublimeness of its object and on [268] account of the sublimeness of the<br>aforesaid factor. Hence it is called “both peaceful and sublime.”</span></nobr></DIV>

So too, when a bhikkhu wants to tame his own mind which<br>has long been spoilt by&nbsp;being reared on visible data, etc., as object for its food<br>and drink, he should take it away&nbsp;from visible data, etc., as object and bring it<br>into the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place and tie it up there to the<br>post of in-breaths and out-breaths with the rope of mindfulness.

And<br>here the sign that arises with the breaths as its support is also called ‘in-breath and<br>out-breath.’ (cf. e.g. §206) ‘The establishment (foundation) is mindfulness’: mindfulness<br>is called ‘establishment (foundation)—(<i>upaṭṭhāna</i>)’ since it approaches (<i>upagantvā</i>) the<br>object and remains (<i>tiṭṭhati</i>) there. ‘The contemplation is knowledge’: contemplation</span></nobr></DIV>

For a skilled cowherd takes pebbles in his pocket and goes to the<br>cow pen in the morning, whip in hand; sitting on the bar of the gate, prodding<br>the cows in the back, he counts each one as it reaches the gate, saying “One,<br>two,” dropping a pebble for each. And the cows of the herd, which have&nbsp;been<br>spending the three watches of the night uncomfortably in the cramped space,<br>come out quickly in parties, jostling each other as they escape. So he counts<br>quickly (early) “Three, four, five” and so up to ten. In this way the in-breaths and<br>out-breaths, which had already become evident to him while he counted them in<br>the former way,&nbsp;now keep moving along quickly.</span></nobr></DIV>

For the<br>notion of a beginning (<i>ādi cintā</i>) is here in the sense of first arising, not in the sense of<br>just arising [once only]. For they actually go on arising throughout [the whole length]<br>from the navel to the nose-tip; and wherever they arise, there in that same place they<br>dissolve,&nbsp;because there is no going (movement) of dhammas. The ordinary term<br>‘motion’ (<i>gatisamaññā</i>) refers to successive&nbsp;arisings in adjacent locations<br>(<i>desantaruppatti</i>) according to conditions. ‘The heart is the middle’: near the heart, just<br>above&nbsp;it is the middle. ‘The nose tip is the end’: the place where the nostrils are is the<br>end; that is the limit of the application of the ordinary term ‘in-breaths and out-<br>breaths,’ for it is accordingly that they are called ‘consciousness-originated,’ there<br>being no production externally of what&nbsp;is consciousness-originated” (Vism-mhṭ 268).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:415;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3346">unmanifest state of the meditation subject and consider thus: “Where do these<br>in-breaths and out-breaths exist? Where do they not? In whom do they&nbsp;exist? In<br>whom not?” Then, as he considers thus, he finds that they do not exist in one<br>inside the mother’s womb, or in those drowned in water, or likewise in unconscious<br>beings,58&nbsp;or in the dead, or in those attained to the fourth jhāna, or in those born<br>into a fine-material or immaterial existence, or in those attained to cessation [of<br>perception and feeling]. So he should apostrophize himself thus: “You with all<br>your wisdom are certainly not inside a mother’s womb or drowned in water or in<br>the unconscious existence or dead or attained to the fourth jhāna or born into<br>the fine-material or immaterial existence or attained to cessation. Those in-breaths<br>and out-breath are actually existent in you, only you are not able to discern them<br>because your understanding is dull.” Then, fixing his mind on the place<br>normally touched [by the breaths], he should proceed to give&nbsp;his attention to<br>that.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:663;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3340">210.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:663;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft3340">These in-breaths and out-breaths occur striking the tip of the nose in a</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:680;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3346">long-nosed man [284] and the upper lip in a short-nosed man. So he should fix<br>the sign thus: “This is the place where they strike.” This was why the Blessed<br>One said: “Bhikkhus, I do not say of one who is forgetful, who is not fully aware,<br>[that he practices] development of mindfulness of breathing” (M III 84).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:784;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3347">57.&nbsp;The point made here is that if the breaths themselves get temporarily too faint to<br>be observed, he should carry on by&nbsp;observing the tip of the nose where they normally<br>touch until they become apparent again. He brings the meditation back to mind for<br>the moment, “as the place (<i>desato</i>)” where they were last noticed, instead of “as<br>breaths,” which have&nbsp;temporarily vanished.<br>58.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft3350">Although any meditation subject, no matter what, is successful only in</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:105;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3355">one who is mindful and fully aware, yet any meditation subject other than this<br>one gets more evident as he goes on giving it his attention. But this mindfulness<br>of breathing is difficult, difficult to develop, a field in which only the minds of<br>Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and Buddhas’ sons are at&nbsp;home. It is no trivial matter,<br>nor can it be cultivated by&nbsp;trivial persons. In proportion as continued attention is<br>given to it, it becomes more peaceful and more subtle. So strong mindfulness<br>and understanding are necessary here.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3350">212.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft3350">Just as when doing needlework&nbsp;on a piece of fine cloth a fine needle is</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3355">needed, and a still finer instrument for boring the needle’s eye,&nbsp;so too, when<br>developing this meditation subject, which resembles fine cloth, both the<br>mindfulness, which is the counterpart of the needle, and the understanding<br>associated with it, which is the counterpart of the instrument for boring the<br>needle’s eye,&nbsp;need to be strong. A bhikkhu must have&nbsp;the necessary mindfulness<br>and understanding and must look for the in-breaths and out-breaths nowhere<br>else than the place normally touched by them.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3355">213.&nbsp;Suppose a ploughman, after doing some ploughing, sent his oxen free to<br>graze and sat down to rest in the shade, then his oxen would soon go into the forest.<br>Now,&nbsp;a skilled ploughman who wants to catch them and yoke&nbsp;them again does not<br>wander through the forest following their tracks, but rather he takes his rope and<br>goad and goes straight to the drinking place where they meet, and he sits or lies<br>there. Then after the oxen have&nbsp;wandered about for a part of the day,&nbsp;they come to the<br>drinking place where they meet and they bathe and drink, and when he sees that<br>they have&nbsp;come out and are standing about, he secures them with the rope, and<br>prodding them with the goad, he brings them back, yokes them, and goes on with<br>his ploughing. So too, the bhikkhu should not look for the in-breaths and out-<br>breaths anywhere else than the place normally touched by&nbsp;them. And he should<br>take the rope of mindfulness and the goad of understanding, and fixing his mind<br>on the place normally touched by&nbsp;them, he should go on giving his attention to that.<br>[285] For as he gives his attention in this way they reappear after no long time, as the<br>oxen did at&nbsp;the drinking place where they met. So he can secure them with the rope<br>of mindfulness, and yoking them in that same place and prodding them with the<br>goad of understanding, he can keep on applying himself to the meditation subject.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:676;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3350">214.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:676;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft3350">When he does so in this way,&nbsp;the sign59&nbsp;soon appears to him. But it is not</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:693;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3355">the same for all; on the contrary, some say that when it appears it does so to<br>certain people producing a light touch like cotton or silk-cotton or a draught.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:732;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3350">215.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:732;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft3350">But this is the exposition given in the commentaries: It appears to some</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:750;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3355">like a star or a cluster of gems or a cluster of pearls, to others with a rough touch<br>like that of silk-cotton seeds or a peg made of heartwood, to others like a long<br>braid string or a wreath of flowers or a puff of smoke,&nbsp;to others like a stretched-</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:127;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft3360">In fact this resembles an occasion when a number of bhikkhus are sitting</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:145;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3366">together reciting a suttanta. When a bhikkhu asks, “What does this sutta appear<br>like to you?” one says, “It appears to me like a great mountain torrent,” another<br>“To me it is like a line of forest trees,” another “To me it is like a spreading fruit<br>tree giving cool shade.” For the one sutta appears to them differently because of<br>the difference in their perception. Similarly this single meditation subject appears<br>differently because of difference in perception.60&nbsp;It is born of perception, its source<br>is perception, it is produced by perception. Therefore it should be understood<br>that when it appears differently it is because of difference in perception.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:288;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3360">217.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:288;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft3360">And here, the consciousness that has in-breath as its object is one, the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:306;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3366">consciousness that has out-breath as its object is another, and the consciousness<br>that has the sign as its object is another. For the meditation subject reaches<br>neither absorption nor even access in one who has not got these three things<br>[clear]. But it reaches access and also absorption in one who has got these three<br>things [clear]. For this is said:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:397;left:171"><nobr><span class="ft3366">“Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object<br>Of a single consciousness;<br>By one who knows not these three things<br>Development is not obtained.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:546;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3360">218.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:546;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft3360">And when the sign has appeared in this way,&nbsp;the bhikkhu should go to</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:563;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3366">the teacher and tell him, “Venerable sir, such and such has appeared to me.” But<br>[say the Dīgha reciters] the teacher should say neither “This is the sign” nor<br>“This is not the sign”; after saying “It happens like this, friend,” he should tell<br>him, “Go on giving it attention again and again;” for if he were told “It is the<br>sign,” he might [become complacent and] stop short at&nbsp;that (see M I 193f.), and<br>if he were told “It is not the sign,” he might get discouraged and give&nbsp;up; so he<br>should encourage him to keep giving it his attention without saying either. So<br>the Dīgha reciters say,&nbsp;firstly. But the Majjhima reciters say that he should be<br>told, “This is the sign, friend. Well done. Keep giving attention to it again and<br>again.”</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:741;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft3360">Then he should fix his mind on that same sign; and so from now on, his</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:759;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft3360">development proceeds by&nbsp;way of fixing. For the Ancients said this:</span></nobr></DIV>

Just as, when a man who is looking for a snake discovers (experiences)<br>its abode, the snake is, as it were, already discovered (experienced) and caught, owing<br>to the ease with which he will then be able to catch it with charms and spells, so too,<br>when the object, which is the abode of the happiness, is experienced (discovered),<br>then the happiness itself is experienced (discovered) too, owing to the ease with which<br>it will be apprehended in its specific and general characteristics. ‘By his penetration of<br>its characteristics’: by&nbsp;penetration of the specific and general characteristics of<br>happiness. For when the specific and general characteristics of anything are<br>experienced then that thing is experienced according to reality” (Vism-mhṭ 276).</span></nobr></DIV>

The<i>&nbsp;experiencing&nbsp;</i>of bliss must<br>be understood to be through three jhānas, and that of the&nbsp;<i>mental formation&nbsp;</i>through<br>four. The mental formation consists of the two aggregates of feeling and<br>perception. And in the case of the clause,&nbsp;<i>experiencing bliss</i>, it is said in the<br>Paṭisambhidā in order to show the plane of insight here [as well]: “‘Bliss’: there<br>are two kinds of bliss, bodily bliss and mental bliss” (Paṭis I 188).&nbsp;<i>Tranquilizing<br>the mental formation</i>: tranquilizing the gross mental formation; stopping it, is the<br>meaning.

Hence it is said: [290] “He trains thus: ‘I<br>shall breathe in … shall breathe out liberating the [manner of] consciousness.65<br>’” So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of mind.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:111;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft3410">(xiii) But in the fourth tetrad, as to&nbsp;<i>contemplating impermanence</i>, here firstly,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:129;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3415">the impermanent should be understood, and impermanence, and the<br>contemplation of impermanence, and one contemplating impermanence.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:168;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft3410">Herein, the five&nbsp;aggregates are&nbsp;<i>the impermanent</i>. Why? Because their essence</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:185;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3415">is rise and fall and change.&nbsp;<i>Impermanence&nbsp;</i>is the rise and fall and change in those<br>same aggregates, or it is their non-existence after having been; the meaning is, it<br>is the breakup of produced aggregates through their momentary dissolution<br>since they do not remain in the same mode.&nbsp;<i>Contemplation of impermanence&nbsp;</i>is<br>contemplation of materiality, etc., as “impermanent” in virtue of that<br>impermanence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>One contemplating impermanence&nbsp;</i>possesses that contemplation.<br>So it is when one such as this is breathing in and breathing out that it can be<br>understood of him: “He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in … shall breathe out<br>contemplating impermanence.’”66</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:365;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3416">mundane knowledge only that he causes greed to cease and does not arouse it. The<br>meaning is that he does not bring about its arising. Or alternatively, his greed having<br>thus faded away, he causes by&nbsp;means of his own knowledge the cessation of the<br>unseen field of formations just as that of the seen, he does not arouse it; the meaning<br>is that he brings about only its cessation, he does not bring about its arising. Having<br>entered on this way,&nbsp;he relinquishes, he does not grasp. What is meant? It is that this<br>contemplation of impermanence, etc., is called relinquishment as giving up and<br>relinquishment as entering into because it gives up defilements along with aggregate-<br>producing kamma-formations and because, by&nbsp;seeing the flaws in what&nbsp;is formed and<br>by&nbsp;inclining towards the opposite of what&nbsp;is formed, namely Nibbāna, it enters into<br>that Nibbāna. Consequently the meditator who has that contemplation gives up<br>defilements and enters into Nibbāna in the way stated. Herein, the contemplation of<br>what&nbsp;is impermanent as only impermanent is ‘contemplation of impermanence’; this<br>is a name for insight that occurs by&nbsp;taking formations of the three [mundane] planes<br>[and leaving aside the supramundane] as impermanent. ‘From the perception of<br>permanence’: from the wrong perception that occurs perceiving formed things as<br>permanent, eternal; also the various views should be regarded as included under the<br>heading of perception. Likewise with the perception of pleasure and so on. ‘By means<br>of the contemplation of dispassion’: by&nbsp;means of the contemplation that occurs in the<br>mode of dispassion for formations. ‘From delight’: from craving accompanied by<br>happiness. ‘By means of the contemplation of fading away’: by&nbsp;means of the<br>contemplation that occurs similarly in the mode of fading away; hence ‘delivering<br>from greed’ is said. ‘By means of the contemplation of cessation’: by&nbsp;means of the<br>successive&nbsp;seeing of formations’ cessation. Or contemplating cessation is contemplation<br>such that formations cease only and do not arise with future renewal. For this is<br>knowledge of desire for deliverance grown strong. Hence he said, ‘delivering from<br>arousing.’ Contemplation that occurs in the mode of relinquishing is ‘contemplation<br>of relinquishment.’ ‘From grasping’: from taking as permanent, etc.; or the meaning<br>can also here be regarded as ‘from grasping rebirth-linking.’ (Vism-mhṭ 279) See<br>Chapters XX and XXI.<br>66.&nbsp;“What is called ‘permanent’ is what&nbsp;is lasting, eternal, like Nibbāna. What is<br>called ‘impermanent’ is what&nbsp;is not permanent, and is possessed of rise and fall. He<br>said ‘The five&nbsp;aggregates are “the impermanent,’” signifying that they are formed</span></nobr></DIV>

Herein, formed<br>dhammas’ arising owing to cause and condition, their coming to be after non-existence,<br>their acquisition of an individual self (<i>attalābha</i>), is ‘rise.’ Their momentary cessation<br>when arisen is ‘fall.’<br>67.&nbsp;“‘Destruction’ is the vanishing of formations; it is the act of those formations’<br>fading away, their disintegration, that is ‘fading away.’ Destruction itself as fading away<br>is ‘fading away&nbsp;as destruction’; this is momentary cessation.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:194;left:290"><nobr><span class="ft3432"><i>[Conclusion]</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:224;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3435">This mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases thus is of great fruit, of<br>great benefit.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:263;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3430">238.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:263;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft3430">Its great beneficialness should be understood here as peacefulness both</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:280;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3435">because of the words, “And, bhikkhus, this concentration through mindfulness<br>of breathing, when developed and much practiced, is both peaceful and sublime”<br>(S V 321), etc., and because of its ability to cut off applied thoughts; for it is<br>because it is peaceful, sublime, and an unadulterated blissful abiding that it cuts<br>off the mind’s running hither and thither with applied thoughts obstructive&nbsp;to<br>concentration, and keeps the mind only on the breaths as object. Hence it is said:<br>“Mindfulness of breathing should be developed in order to cut off applied<br>thoughts” (A IV 353).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:424;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3430">239.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:424;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft3430">Also its great beneficialness should be understood as the root condition</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:441;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3435">for the perfecting of clear vision and deliverance; for this has been said by&nbsp;the<br>Blessed One: “Bhikkhus, mindfulness of breathing, when developed and much<br>practiced, perfects the four foundations of mindfulness.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:550;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft3430">Again its great beneficialness should be understood to reside in the fact</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:568;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3435">that it causes the final in-breaths and out-breaths to be known; for this is said by<br>the Blessed One: “Rāhula, when mindfulness of breathing is thus developed,<br>thus practiced much, the final in-breaths and out-breaths, too, are known as they<br>cease, not unknown” (M I 425f.).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:642;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3430">241.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:642;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft3430">Herein, there are three kinds of [breaths that are] final because of cessation,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:659;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3435">that is to say,&nbsp;final in becoming, final in jhāna, and final in death. For,&nbsp;among the<br>various kinds of becoming (existence), in-breaths and out-breaths occur in the<br>sensual-sphere becoming, not in the fine-material and immaterial kinds of<br>becoming. That is why there are final ones in becoming. In the jhānas they occur</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:749;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3436">&nbsp;the case of perception of pain, and so on. ‘Through seeing the wretchedness of what<br>is formed’: through seeing the fault of impermanence, etc., in the formed three-plane<br>field of formations. It is ‘the opposite of the formed’ owing to its permanence, and so<br>on. When defilements are given up by&nbsp;the path, then kamma-formations are called<br>‘given up’ through producing (<i>āpādana</i>) in them the nature of not causing result, and<br>aggregates rooted in them are called ‘given up’ through their being rendered fit for<br>non-arising. So the path gives up all these, is what&nbsp;is meant” (Vism-mhṭ 281). The<br>word&nbsp;<i>pakkhandana</i>&nbsp;(rendered by&nbsp;“entering into”) is used to define the act of faith, and<br>can also be rendered by&nbsp;“launching out into” or by&nbsp;“leap.”</span></nobr></DIV>

That kind of dhamma is excluded by&nbsp;his saying,&nbsp;<i>‘Dhammas<br>[means] individual essences.’</i>&nbsp;The act of becoming (<i>bhavana</i>), which constitutes existing-<br>ness (<i>vijjamānatā</i>) in the ultimate sense, is essence (<i>bhāva</i>); it is with essence (<i>saha<br>bhāvena</i>), thus it is an individual essence (<i>sabhāva</i>); the meaning is that it is possible<br>(<i>labbhamānarūpa</i>) in the true sense, in the ultimate sense. For these are called ‘dhammas<br>(bearers)’ because they bear (<i>dhāraṇa</i>) their own individual essences (<i>sabhāva</i>), and<br>they are called ‘individual essences’ in the sense already explained” (Vism-mhṭ 282;<br>cf. Ch. VII, n. 1).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:380;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft3454">In the Piṭakas the word&nbsp;<i>sabhāva</i>&nbsp;seems to appear only once (Paṭis II 178). It next</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:396;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3457">appears in the Netti (p.79), the&nbsp;<i>Milindapañhā</i>&nbsp;(pp. 90, 164, 212, 360). It is extensively<br>used for exegetical purposes in the&nbsp;<i>Visuddhimagga</i>&nbsp;and main commentaries and likewise<br>in the subcommentaries. As has just been shown, it is narrower than dhamma (see<br>also Ch. XXIII. n. 18). It often roughly corresponds to&nbsp;<i>dhātu</i>&nbsp;(element—see e.g. Dhs-a<br>263) and to&nbsp;<i>lakkhaṇa</i>&nbsp;(characteristic—see below), but less nearly to the vaguer and (in<br>Pali) untechnical&nbsp;<i>pakati</i>&nbsp;(nature), or to&nbsp;<i>rasa</i>&nbsp;(function—see I.21). The&nbsp;<i>Atthasālinī&nbsp;</i>observes:<br>“It is the individual essence, or the generality, of such and such dhammas that is called<br>their characteristic” (Dhs-a 63); on which the&nbsp;<i>Mūla Þīkā</i>&nbsp;comments: “The&nbsp;<i>individual<br>essence</i>&nbsp;consisting in, say,&nbsp;hardness as that of earth, or touching as that of contact, is<br>not common to all dhammas. The&nbsp;<i>generality</i>&nbsp;is the individual essence common to all<br>consisting in impermanence, etc.; also in this context (i.e. Dhs §1) the characteristic of<br>being profitable may be regarded as general because it is the individual&nbsp;<i>essence<br></i>common to all that is profitable; or alternatively it is their individual&nbsp;<i>essence</i>&nbsp;because it<br>is not common to the unprofitable and indeterminate [kinds of consciousness]” (Dhs-<br>a 63). The individual&nbsp;<i>essence</i>&nbsp;of any formed dhamma is manifested in the three instants<br>of its existence (<i>atthitā, vijjamānatā</i>), namely, arising, presence (= aging) and dissolution.<br>It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere (XV.15) and is borne by&nbsp;the mind. Dhammas<br>without individual essence (<i>asabhāvadhamma</i>) include the attainment of cessation (see<br>Ch. XXIII, n. 18) and some concepts. Space and time belong to the last-mentioned. Of<br>space (<i>ākāsa</i>) the&nbsp;<i>Majjhima Nikāya</i>&nbsp;<i>Þīkā</i>&nbsp;says: “Space, which is quite devoid of individual<br>essence, is called empty” (commenting on MN 106), while of time (<i>kāla</i>) the&nbsp;<i>Mūla Þīkā<br></i>says: “Though time is determined by the kind of consciousness [e.g. as specified in<br>the first paragraph of the Dhammasaṅgaṇī] and is non-existent (<i>avijjamāna</i>) as to<br>individual essence, yet as the non-entity (<i>abhāva</i>) before and after the moment in<br>which those [conascent and co-present] dhammas occur,&nbsp;it is called the ‘container<br>(<i>adhikaraṇa</i>)’; it is perceived (symbolized) only as the state of a receptacle (<i>ādhāra-bhāva</i>)<br>(Dhs-a 62). Of Nibbāna (for which see XVI.46ff.), which has its own individual essence,&nbsp;the<br><i>Mūla Þīkā</i>&nbsp;says “Nibbāna is not like other dhammas; because of its extreme profundity it<br>cannot be made an object of consciousness (<i>ālambituṃ</i>) by one who has not realized it.<br>That is why it has to be realized by&nbsp;change-of-lineage. It has profundity surpassing any<br>individual essence belonging to the three periods of time” (Vibh-a 38).</span></nobr></DIV>

This may be remembered when&nbsp;<i>sabhāva</i>&nbsp;is defined as above&nbsp;thus: “It is with<br>essence (<i>sahabhāvena</i>), thus it is individual essence (<i>sabhāva</i>)” (Vism-mhṭ 282), and<br>when it is defined again thus: “A dhamma’s own essence or its existing essence (<i>sako<br>vā bhāvo samāno vā bhāvo</i>) is its individual essence (<i>sabhāva</i>)” (Vism-mhṭ 433).&nbsp;<i>Sabhāva<br></i>can also be the basis of a wrong view,&nbsp;if regarded as the sole efficient cause or<br>condition of any formed thing (Ch. XVI, n.23). The Sanskrit equivalent,&nbsp;<i>svabhāva</i>, had<br>a great vogue and checkered history in philosophical discussions on the Indian<br>mainland.</span></nobr></DIV>

The word is a purely exegetical one;<br>consequently vagueness is undesirable. “Individual essence” has been chosen<br>principally on etymological grounds, and the word “essence” (an admittedly slippery<br>customer) must be understood from the contexts in which it is used and not prejudged.<br>Strictly it refers here to the triple moment of arising etc., of formed dhammas that can<br>have&nbsp;such “existence” in their own right and be experienced as such; and it refers to<br>the realizability of Nibbāna. We&nbsp;are here in the somewhat&nbsp;magical territory of ontology,<br>a subject that is at&nbsp;present undergoing one of its periodical upheavals in Europe, this<br>time in the hands of the existentialists. Consequently it is important to approach the<br>subject with an open mind.<br>70.</span></nobr></DIV>

Herein, ‘vanity of conceit (<i>māna-<br>mada</i>)’ is conceit (<i>māna</i>) that occurs as conceiving (<i>maññanā</i>) ‘I am superior’ (Vibh 353).<br>‘Vanity of manhood’ is vanity about being of the male sex. The words ‘such as’ refer<br>to vanity of birth, and so on (Vibh 345)” (Vism-mhṭ 282).</span></nobr></DIV>

It is called&nbsp;<i>Nibbāna&nbsp;</i>(extinction) because<br>it has gone away&nbsp;from (<i>nikkhanta</i>), has escaped from (<i>nissaṭa</i>), is dissociated from<br>craving, which has acquired in common usage the name “fastening” (<i>vāna</i>)<br>because, by&nbsp;ensuring successive&nbsp;becoming, craving serves as a joining together,<br>a binding together, a lacing together, of the four kinds of generation, five&nbsp;destinies,<br>seven stations of consciousness and nine abodes of beings.73&nbsp;[294]</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:197;left:114"><nobr><span class="ft3470">This is how peace, in other words, Nibbāna, should be recollected</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3476">according to its special qualities beginning with disillusionment of vanity. But<br>it should also be recollected according to the other special qualities of peace<br>stated by&nbsp;the Blessed One in the suttas beginning with: “Bhikkhus, I shall teach<br>you the unformed … the truth … the other shore … the hard-to-see … the<br>undecaying … the lasting … the undiversified … the deathless … the auspicious<br>… the safe … the marvellous … the intact … the unafflicted … the purity … the<br>island … the shelter ….” (S IV 360–72).74</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:358;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3476">etc., in this way,&nbsp;then: “On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by&nbsp;greed or<br>obsessed by&nbsp;hate or obsessed by&nbsp;delusion; his mind has rectitude on that occasion,<br>being inspired by peace” (see VII.65, etc.). So when he has suppressed the<br>hindrances in the way already described under the recollection of the<br>Enlightened One, etc., the jhāna factors arise in a single moment. But owing to<br>the profundity of the special qualities of peace, or owing to his being occupied<br>in recollecting special qualities of various kinds, the jhāna is only access and<br>does not reach absorption. And that jhāna itself is known as “recollection of<br>peace” too because it arises by means of the special qualities of peace.</span></nobr></DIV>

And even if he<br>penetrates no higher, he is at&nbsp;least headed for a happy destiny.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:730;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft3477">73.&nbsp;Modern etymology derives the word Nibbāna (Skr.&nbsp;<i>nirvāṇa</i>) from the negative<br>prefix&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>nir</i>&nbsp;plus the root&nbsp;<i>vā</i>&nbsp;(to blow). The original literal meaning was probably<br>“extinction” of a fire by&nbsp;ceasing to blow&nbsp;on it with bellows (a smith’s fire for example).<br>It seems to have&nbsp;been extended to extinction of fire by&nbsp;any means,&nbsp;for example, the<br>going out of a lamp’s flame (<i>nibbāyati—</i>M III 245). By analogy it was extended to the<br>extinction of the five-aggregate process on the Arahant’s death (see It 38). Nibbāna is<br>not the “extinction of a self or of a living lasting being,” such a mistaken opinion being<br>the annihilation view (see e.g. M I 140, S III 109).<br>74.</span></nobr></DIV>
