<DIV style="position:absolute;top:53;left:352"><nobr><span class="ft7612"><i>Purification by Knowledge and Vision</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7616">7.&nbsp;Herein, conformity is able to dispel the murk&nbsp;of defilements that conceals the<br>truths, but is unable to make Nibbāna its object. Change-of-lineage is only able<br>to make Nibbāna its object, but it is unable to dispel the murk&nbsp;that conceals the<br>truths.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:162;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7616">8.&nbsp;Here is a simile: [674] A man with eyes went out at&nbsp;night, it seems, to find out<br>the conjunction of the stars, and he looked up to see the moon. It was invisible<br>because it was concealed by&nbsp;clouds. Then a wind sprang up and blew&nbsp;away&nbsp;the<br>thick clouds; another blew&nbsp;away&nbsp;the medium clouds; and another blew&nbsp;away&nbsp;the<br>fine clouds as well. Then the man saw the moon in the sky free from clouds, and<br>he found out the conjunction of the stars.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:271;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7616">9.&nbsp;Herein, the thick, medium and fine kinds of darkness that conceal the truths<br>are like the three kinds of cloud. The three kinds of conformity consciousness<br>are like the three winds. Change-of-lineage knowledge is like the man with eyes.<br>Nibbāna is like the moon. The dispelling of the murk&nbsp;that conceals the truths by<br>each kind of conformity consciousness is like the successive&nbsp;blowing away&nbsp;of<br>the clouds by&nbsp;each wind. Change-of-lineage knowledge’s seeing the clear<br>Nibbāna when the murk&nbsp;that concealed the truths has disappeared is like the<br>man’s seeing the clear moon in the sky free from cloud.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:415;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7616">10.&nbsp;Just as the three winds are able only to blow&nbsp;away&nbsp;the clouds that conceal<br>the moon but cannot see the moon, so the three kinds of conformity are able only<br>to dispel the murk&nbsp;that conceals the truths but cannot see Nibbāna. Just as the<br>man can only see the moon but cannot blow&nbsp;away&nbsp;the clouds, so change-of-<br>lineage knowledge can only see Nibbāna but cannot dispel the defilements.<br>Hence it is called “adverting to the path.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:524;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7616">11.&nbsp;For although it is not adverting, it occupies the position of adverting; and<br>then, after, as it were, giving a sign to the path to come into being, it ceases. And<br>without pausing after the sign given by&nbsp;that the change-of-lineage knowledge,<br>the path follows upon it in uninterrupted continuity, and as it comes into being<br>it pierces and explodes the mass of greed, the mass of hate, and the mass of<br>delusion never pierced and exploded before (cf. Paṭis II 20).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7616">12.&nbsp;Here is a simile for this. An archer, it seems, had a target3&nbsp;set up at&nbsp;a distance<br>of eight&nbsp;<i>usabhas</i>&nbsp;(about 100 yards), and wrapping his face in a cloth and arming<br>himself with an arrow, he stood on a wheel contrivance (a revolving platform).<br>Another man turned the wheel contrivance, and when the target was opposite<br>the archer, he gave&nbsp;him a sign with a stick. Without pausing after the sign the<br>archer shot the arrow&nbsp;and hit the target.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:741;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7616">13.&nbsp;Herein, change-of-lineage knowledge is like the sign with the stick. Path<br>knowledge is like the archer. Path knowledge’s [675] making Nibbāna its object<br>without pausing after the sign given by&nbsp;change-of-lineage, and its piercing and<br>exploding the mass of greed, hate and delusion never pierced and exploded<br>before, is like the archer’s hitting the target without pausing after the sign.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:845;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7614">3.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:845;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft7615"><i>Phalakasataṃ—</i>“target”: not in PED. Vism-mhṭ says “<i>Phalakasatan ti asana-sāra-</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:861;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7617"><i>mayaṃ phalakasataṃ—</i>a “<i>phalakasata</i>” is one made of the heart (pith) of the&nbsp;<i>asana</i>&nbsp;tree.”<br>The “wheel contrivance” resembles a potter’s wheel according to Vism-mhṭ (p.867).</span></nobr></DIV>

For change-of-lineage knowledge arises<br>at&nbsp;the end of conformity’s repetition, so at&nbsp;the minimum there must be two<br>conformity consciousnesses, since one alone does not act as repetition condition.<br>And a single series of impulsions has a maximum of seven [impulsion]<br>consciousnesses.

Trainers may or may not have&nbsp;the reviewing of the defilements<br>abandoned and those still remaining. In fact it was owing to the absence of such<br>reviewing that Mahānāma asked the Blessed One, “What state is there still<br>unabandoned by&nbsp;me internally owing to which at&nbsp;times states of greed invade<br>my mind and remain?” (M I 91) all of which should be quoted.</span></nobr></DIV>

He brings to bear the faculties,6&nbsp;the powers, and the enlightenment factors,<br>and he works over and turns up that same field of formations, classed as<br>materiality, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, with the<br>knowledge that they are impermanent, painful, not-self, and he embarks upon<br>the progressive&nbsp;series of insights.</span></nobr></DIV>

But this is called ‘change-of-lineage’<br>figuratively because of its similarity to the other. It is also called ‘cleansing’ (<i>vodāna</i>) because<br>it purifies from certain defilements and because it makes absolute purification its object.<br>Hence it is said in the Paṭṭhāna, ‘Conformity is a condition, as proximity condition, for<br>cleansing’ (Paṭṭh I 59). But ‘<i>next to change-of-lineage</i>’ is said here because it is said in the<br>Paṭisambhidāmagga that for the purpose of ‘overcoming arising,’ etc., ‘eight states of<br>change-of-lineage arise through concentration’ and ‘ten states of change-of-lineage arise<br>through concentration’ and ‘ten states of change-of-lineage arise through insight’ (Paṭis I<br>68–69), and it is given in the same way in this page” (Vism-mhṭ 869).</span></nobr></DIV>

[679]<br>That is why “four foundations of mindfulness” is said.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:214;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7660">35.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:214;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft7660">By it they endeavour (<i>padahanti</i>), thus it is endeavour (<i>padhāna</i>); a good</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7666">endeavour is a right (<i>sammā</i>) endeavour. Or alternatively: by&nbsp;its means people<br>endeavour rightly (<i>sammā padahanti</i>), thus it is right endeavour (<i>sammappa-<br>dhāna</i>). Or alternatively: it is good because of abandoning the unseemliness<br>of defilement, and it is endeavour because of bringing about improvement<br>and giving precedence (<i>padhāna-bhāva-kāraṇa</i>) in the sense of producing<br>well-being and bliss, thus it is right endeavour. It is a name for energy. It<br>accomplishes the functions of abandoning arisen unprofitable things,<br>preventing the arising of those not yet arisen, arousing unarisen profitable<br>things, and maintaining those already arisen; thus it is fourfold. That is why<br>“four right endeavours” is said.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:410;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7666">36.&nbsp;Power (<i>iddhi</i>) is in the sense of success (<i>ijjhana</i>) as already described (XII.44). It<br>is the road (basis—<i>pāda</i>) to that power (for that success—<i>iddhi</i>) in the sense of being<br>the precursor of that success which is associated with it and in the sense of being the<br>prior cause of that success which is its fruit, thus it is a road to power (basis for<br>success). It is fourfold as zeal (desire), and so on. That is why “four roads to power”<br>are spoken of, according as it is said: “Four roads to power:&nbsp;the road to power<br>consisting in zeal, the road to power consisting in energy, the road to power consisting<br>in [natural purity of] consciousness, the road to power consisting in inquiry” (Vibh<br>223). These are supramundane only. But because of the words “If a bhikkhu obtains<br>concentration, obtains mental unification by&nbsp;making zeal predominant, this is called<br>concentration through zeal” (Vibh 216), etc., they are also mundane as states acquired<br>by&nbsp;predominance of zeal, etc., respectively.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:624;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7666">37.&nbsp;“Faculty” is in the sense of predominance, in other words, of overcoming,<br>because [these states, as faculties] respectively overcome faithlessness, idleness,<br>negligence, distraction, and confusion.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:680;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7660">“Power” is in the sense of unwaveringness because [these states, as powers]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:698;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7666">are incapable of being overcome respectively by&nbsp;faithlessness, and so on. Both<br>are fivefold as consisting in faith, [energy, mindfulness, concentration, and<br>understanding]. That is why “five&nbsp;faculties” and “five&nbsp;powers” is said.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:770;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7668">and from a different angle in the commentary to the Magga Vibhaṅga. The five&nbsp;faculties<br>and the five&nbsp;powers are not apparently dealt with in the Nikāya and the Abhidhamma<br>Commentaries by&nbsp;adding anything further to what&nbsp;is said here (§37).<br>9.&nbsp;The Paṭisambhidā (Paṭis I 177) derives&nbsp;<i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<i>sati</i>&nbsp;(mindfulness) and<br><i>paṭṭhāna</i>&nbsp;(foundation, establishment). The commentaries prefer to derive&nbsp;it from&nbsp;<i>sati<br></i>and&nbsp;<i>upaṭṭhāna</i>&nbsp;(establishment, appearance, and also waiting upon: see M-a I 238). The<br>readings of the Ee and Ae&nbsp;eds. disagree here and that of the former has been followed<br>though the result is much the same.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7756">79.&nbsp;That is not an original argument; for in the text first the question is put:<br>“When a man abandons defilements, does he abandon past defilements? Does<br>he abandon future defilements? Does he abandon present defilements?” Then<br>the objection is put in this way: “If he abandons past defilements, he destroys<br>what&nbsp;has already been destroyed, causes to cease what&nbsp;has already ceased,<br>causes to vanish what&nbsp;has already vanished, causes to subside what&nbsp;has already<br>subsided. What is past, which is non-existent, that he abandons.” But this is<br>denied in this way: “He does not abandon past defilements.” Then the objection<br>is put in this way: “If he abandons future defilements, he abandons what&nbsp;has<br>not been born, he abandons what&nbsp;has not been generated, he abandons what<br>has not arisen, he abandons what&nbsp;has not become manifest. What is future,<br>which is non-existent, that he abandons.” But this is denied in this way: “He<br>does not abandon future defilements.” Then the objection is put in this way: “If<br>he abandons present defilements, then though inflamed with greed he abandons<br>greed, though corrupted with hate he abandons hate, though deluded he<br>abandons delusion, though shackled17&nbsp;he abandons conceit (pride), though<br>misconceiving he abandons [false] view,&nbsp;though distracted he abandons<br>agitation, though not having made up his mind he abandons uncertainty, though<br>not having inveterate habits he abandons inherent tendency, dark and bright<br>states occur coupled together, and there is development of a path that has<br>defilement.” But this is all denied in this way: “He does not abandon past<br>defilements, he does not abandon future defilements, he does not abandon present<br>defilements.” Finally it is asked: “Then there is no path development, there is no<br>realization of fruition, there is no abandoning of defilements,&nbsp;there is no<br>penetration to the Dhamma (convergence of states)?” Then it is claimed: “There<br>is path development … there is penetration to the Dhamma (convergence of<br>states).”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:562;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft7750">And when it is asked: “In what&nbsp;way?” this is said: “Suppose there were a</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:145;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7766">80.&nbsp;What does that show? It shows abandoning of defilements that have&nbsp;soil [to<br>grow&nbsp;in].

And kamma-result that&nbsp;has its<br>opportunity made in this way,&nbsp;even when as yet unarisen, is called “arisen by<br>opportunity made,” too, because it is sure to arise when an opportunity for it has<br>been made in this way.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7776">so on. And if that&nbsp;were what&nbsp;is called “arisen by&nbsp;having soil [to grow&nbsp;in]” no one<br>could abandon the root of becoming because it would be unabandonable. But “arisen<br>by&nbsp;having soil [to grow&nbsp;in]” should be understood [subjectively] with respect to the<br>basis [for them in oneself].20&nbsp;For the defilements that are the root of the round are<br>inherent in [one’s own] aggregates not fully understood by&nbsp;insight from the instant<br>those aggregates arise. And that is what&nbsp;should be understood as “arisen by&nbsp;having<br>the soil [to grow&nbsp;in],” in the sense of its being unabandoned. [688]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7776">84.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;when defilements are inherent, in the sense of being unabandoned,<br>in someone’s aggregates, it is only those aggregates of his that are the basis for<br>those defilements, not aggregates belonging to another. And only past<br>aggregates, not others, are the basis for defilements that inhere unabandoned in<br>past aggregates. Likewise in the case of future aggregates, and so on. Similarly<br>too only sense-sphere aggregates, not others, are the basis for defilements that<br>inhere unabandoned in sense-sphere aggregates. Likewise in the case of the<br>fine material and immaterial.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:358;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7776">85.&nbsp;But in the case of the stream-enterer, etc., when a given defilement, which is<br>a root of the round, has been abandoned by&nbsp;means of a given path in a given<br>noble person’s aggregates, then his aggregates are no longer called “soil” for<br>such defilement since they are no longer a basis for it. But in an ordinary man<br>the defilements that are the root of the round are not abandoned at&nbsp;all, and so<br>whatever kamma he performs is always either profitable or unprofitable. So for<br>him the round goes on revolving with kamma and defilements as its condition.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:484;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7776">86.&nbsp;But while it is thus the root of the round it cannot be said that it is only in<br>his materiality aggregate, and not in his other aggregates beginning with feeling<br>… that it is only in his consciousness aggregate, and not in his other aggregates<br>beginning with materiality. Why? Because it is inherent in all five&nbsp;aggregates<br>indiscriminately. How? Like the juice of humus, etc., in a tree.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:576;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7776">87.&nbsp;For when a great tree is growing on the earth’s surface supported by&nbsp;the<br>essences of humus and water and, with that as condition, increases its roots,<br>trunks, branches, twigs, shoots, foliage, flowers, and fruit, till it fills the sky, and<br>continues the tree’s lineage through the succession of the seed up till the end of<br>the eon, it cannot be said that the essence of humus, etc., are found only in its root<br>and not in the trunk, etc., … that they are only in the fruit and not in the root, etc.,<br>Why? Because they spread indiscriminately through the whole of it from the<br>root onwards.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:720;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7776">88.&nbsp;But some man who felt revulsion for that same tree’s flowers, fruits, etc.,<br>might puncture it on four sides with the poison thorn called “<i>maṇḍūka</i>&nbsp;thorn,”<br>and then the tree, being poisoned, would be no more able to prolong its continuity<br>since it would have&nbsp;become barren with the contamination of the essences of<br>humus and water.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:850;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7777">20.&nbsp;“No one would be able to abandon the root of becoming if it were in another’s<br>continuity. ‘<i>With respect to the basis&nbsp;</i>[<i>for them in oneself</i>]’ means as the place of their<br>arising; in that particular becoming or continuity” (Vism-mhṭ 880).</span></nobr></DIV>

Then the<br>continuity of his aggregates is rendered incapable of prolonging the continuity<br>to a subsequent becoming. It is now unproductive&nbsp;of future becoming since all<br>kinds of kamma beginning with bodily kamma are now merely functional: for<br>the effect of the four paths’ poison has entirely exterminated the defilements that<br>are the root of the round.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:284;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft7780">Besides these there are four other ways of classing “arisen,” namely, (v)</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:341;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7780">Herein, (v)&nbsp;<i>arisen as happening</i>&nbsp;is the same as (i) “arisen as actually occurring.”</span></nobr></DIV>

Like the defilement that arose in the Elder Mahā-Tissa<br>after seeing the form of a person of the opposite sex while wandering for alms in<br>the village of Kalyāna (cf. M-a I 66 and A-a to A I 4).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:471;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7780">(vii) As long as a defilement is not suppressed by either serenity or insight,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:489;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7783">though it may not have&nbsp;actually entered the conscious continuity, it is nevertheless<br>called&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>arisen through non-suppression</i>&nbsp;because there is no cause to prevent its<br>arising [if suitable conditions combine]. (viii) But even when they are suppressed<br>by serenity or insight they are still called&nbsp;<i>arisen through non-abolition</i>&nbsp;because the<br>necessity for their arising has not been transcended unless they have&nbsp;been cut<br>off by&nbsp;the path. Like the elder who had obtained the eight attainments, and the<br>defilements that arose in him while he was going through the air on his hearing<br>the sound of a woman singing with a sweet voice as she was gathering flowers<br>in a grove of blossoming trees.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:650;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7780">90.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:650;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft7780">And the three kinds, namely, (vi) arisen with apprehension of an object,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:667;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7783">(vii) arisen through non-suppression, and (vii) arisen through non-abolition,<br>should be understood as included by&nbsp;(iv) arisen by&nbsp;having soil [to grow&nbsp;in].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:707;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7780">91.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:707;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft7780">So as regard the kinds of “arisen” stated, the four kinds, namely, (i) as</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:724;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7783">actually occurring, (ii) as been and gone, (iii) by&nbsp;opportunity made, and (v) as<br>happening, cannot be abandoned by&nbsp;any [of these four kinds of] knowledge<br>because they cannot be eliminated by&nbsp;the paths. But the four kinds of “arisen,”<br>namely, (iv) by&nbsp;having soil [to grow&nbsp;in], (vi) with apprehension of an object, (vii)<br>through non-suppression, and (viii) through non-abolition, can all be<br>abandoned because a given mundane or supramundane knowledge, when it<br>arises, nullifies a given one of these modes of being arisen.</span></nobr></DIV>

And further it is said: “The knowledge of one who possesses<br>the path is knowledge of suffering and it is knowledge of the origin of suffering<br>and it is knowledge of the cessation of suffering and it is knowledge of the way<br>leading to the cessation of suffering” (Paṭis I 119).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7803">97.&nbsp;So when his knowledge occurs with the four functions in a single moment<br>at&nbsp;the time of penetrating the four truths, then the four truths have&nbsp;a single<br>penetration in the sense of trueness (reality) in sixteen ways, as it is said: “How<br>is there single penetration of the four truths in the sense of trueness? There is<br>single penetration of the four truths in the sense of trueness in sixteen aspects:<br>suffering has the meaning of oppressing, meaning of being formed, meaning of<br>burning (torment), meaning of change, as its meaning of trueness; origin has<br>the meaning of accumulation, meaning of source, meaning of bondage, meaning<br>of impediment, as its meaning of trueness; cessation has the meaning of escape,<br>meaning of seclusion, meaning of being not formed, meaning of deathlessness,<br>as its meaning of trueness; the path has the meaning of outlet, meaning of cause,<br>meaning of seeing, meaning of dominance, as its meaning of trueness. The four<br>truths in these sixteen ways are included as one. What is included as one is<br>unity. Unity is penetrated by&nbsp;a single knowledge. Thus the four truths have&nbsp;a<br>single penetration” (Paṭis II 107).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:497;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7803">98.&nbsp;Here it may be asked: “Since there are other meanings of suffering, etc., too,<br>such as ‘a disease, a tumour’ (Paṭis II 238; M I 435), etc., why then are only four<br>mentioned for each?” We&nbsp;answer that in this context it is better because of what<br>is evident through seeing the other [three truths in each case].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:571;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7800">Firstly, in the passage beginning, “Herein, what&nbsp;is knowledge of suffering? It</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:589;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7803">is the understanding, the act of understanding … that arises contingent upon<br>suffering” (Paṭis I 119), knowledge of the truths is presented as having a single<br>truth as its object [individually]. But in the passage beginning, “Bhikkhus, he<br>who sees suffering also sees its origin” (S V 437), it is presented as accomplishing<br>its function with respect to the other three truths simultaneously with its making<br>one of them its object.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:698;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7803">99.&nbsp;As regards these [two contexts], when, firstly, knowledge makes each truth<br>its object singly, then [when suffering is made the object], suffering has the<br>characteristic of&nbsp;<i>oppressing</i>&nbsp;as its individual essence, but its&nbsp;<i>sense of being formed<br></i>becomes evident through seeing origin because that suffering is accumulated,<br>formed, agglomerated, by&nbsp;the origin, which has the characteristic of<br>accumulating. Then the cooling path removes the burning of the defilements,<br>[692] and so suffering’s&nbsp;<i>sense of burning&nbsp;</i>becomes evident through seeing the<br>path, as the beauty’s (Sundarī’s) ugliness did to the venerable Nanda through<br>seeing the celestial nymphs (see Ud 23). But its&nbsp;<i>sense of changing</i>&nbsp;becomes evident<br>through seeing cessation as not subject to change, which needs no explaining.</span></nobr></DIV>
