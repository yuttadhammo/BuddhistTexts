That progress is difficult for some, being troublesome<br>owing to the tenacious resistance of the inimical states beginning with the<br>hindrances. The meaning is that it is cultivated without ease.&nbsp;[87] It is easy for<br>others because of the absence of those difficulties. Also the direct-knowledge is<br>sluggish in some and occurs slowly, not quickly. In others it is swift and occurs<br>rapidly, not slowly.</span></nobr></DIV>

When he cultivates what&nbsp;is suitable, his progress is<br>easy and his direct-knowledge swift. But if he cultivates the unsuitable in the earlier<br>stage and the suitable in the later stage, or if he cultivates the suitable in the earlier<br>stage and the unsuitable in the later stage, then it should be understood as mixed in<br>his case. Likewise if he devotes himself to development without carrying out the<br>preparatory tasks of severing impediments, etc., his progress is difficult. It is easy in<br>the opposite case. And if he is not accomplished in skill in absorption, his direct-<br>knowledge is sluggish. It is swift if he is so accomplished.</span></nobr></DIV>

Do you live&nbsp;in this way all the time?”—<br>“Yes, friend.”—”Venerable sir, Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī is comfortable; let us go there.”<br>Now,&nbsp;as the elder came out from the city [91] by&nbsp;the southern gate he took the<br>Kumbhakāragāma road [which leads to Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī]. The visitor asked, “But,<br>venerable sir, why do you take this road?”—”Did you not recommend<br>Pācīnakhaṇḍarājī, friend?”—”But how is this, venerable sir, have&nbsp;you no extra<br>belongings in the place you have&nbsp;lived in for so long?”—”That is so, friend. The<br>bed and chair belong to the Community, and they are put away&nbsp;[as usual]. There is<br>nothing else.”—”But, venerable sir,&nbsp;I have&nbsp;left my staff and my oil tube and my<br>sandal bag there.”—”Have&nbsp;you already collected so much, friend, living there for<br>just one day?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:478;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1466">34.&nbsp;He was glad in his heart, and he paid homage to the elder: “For those like<br>you, venerable sir, everywhere is a forest dwelling. The Thūpārāma is a place where<br>the relics of four Buddhas are deposited; there is suitable hearing of the Dhamma<br>in the Brazen Palace; there is the Great Shrine to be seen; and one can visit elders.<br>It is like the time of the Buddha. It is here that you should live.” On the following<br>day he took his bowl and [outer] robe and went away&nbsp;by&nbsp;himself. It is no impediment<br>for one like that.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:605;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1466">35.&nbsp;<i>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Family&nbsp;</i>means a family consisting of relatives or of supporters. For even a<br>family consisting of supporters is an impediment for someone who lives in close<br>association with it in the way beginning, “He is pleased when they are pleased” (S<br>III 11), and who does not even go to a neighbouring monastery to hear the Dhamma<br>without members of the family.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:696;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1466">36.&nbsp;But even mother and father are not an impediment for another, as in the case<br>of the young bhikkhu, the nephew of the elder who lived at&nbsp;the Koraṇḍaka<br>Monastery. He went to Rohaṇa for instruction, it seems. The elder’s sister, who was<br>a lay devotee, was always asking the elder how her son was getting on. One day<br>the elder set out for Rohaṇa to fetch him back.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:788;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1466">37.&nbsp;The young bhikkhu too thought, “I have&nbsp;lived here for a long time. Now I<br>might go and visit my preceptor and find out how the lay devotee is,” and he left</span></nobr></DIV>

When asked, “Where are you going?” he told him his<br>purpose. The elder said: “You have&nbsp;done well. The lay devotee is always asking<br>after you. That was why I came. You may go, but I shall stay here for the Rains,”<br>and he dismissed him. [92] He arrived at&nbsp;the monastery on the actual day for taking<br>up residence for the Rains. The lodging allotted to him happened to be the one for<br>which his father had undertaken responsibility.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:213;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1476">38.&nbsp;His father came on the following day and asked, “To whom was our lodging<br>allotted, venerable sirs?” When he heard that it had fallen to a young visitor,&nbsp;he<br>went to him. After paying homage to him, he said, “Venerable sir, there is an<br>obligation for him who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging.”—<br>”What is it, lay follower?”—”It is to take alms food only in our house for the three<br>months, and to let us know the time of departure after the Pavāraṇā ceremony.”<br>He consented in silence. The lay devotee went home and told his wife.&nbsp;“There is a<br>visiting lord who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging. He must be<br>carefully looked after,” and she agreed. She prepared good food of various kinds<br>for him.14&nbsp;Though the youth went to his relatives’ home at&nbsp;the time of the meal, no<br>one recognized him.</span></nobr></DIV>

Then his<br>relatives said, “Let it be tomorrow, venerable sir,” and on the following day,&nbsp;when<br>they had fed him in their house and filled his oil tube and given him a lump of<br>sugar and a nine-cubit length of cloth, they said, “Now you are leaving, venerable<br>sir.” He gave&nbsp;his blessing and set out for Rohaṇa.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:518;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1476">40.&nbsp;His preceptor had completed the Pavāraṇā ceremony and was on his way<br>back. They met at&nbsp;the same place as before. He did the duties to the elder at&nbsp;the<br>foot of a tree. The elder asked him, “How&nbsp;was it, my dear, did you see the good<br>woman lay devotee?” He replied, “Yes, venerable sir,” and he told him all that had<br>happened. He then anointed the elder’s feet with the oil, made him a drink with<br>the sugar, and presented him with the length of cloth. He then, after paying homage<br>to the elder, told him, “Venerable sir, only Rohaṇa suits me,” and he departed. The<br>elder too arrived back at&nbsp;his monastery, and next day he went into the village of<br>Koraṇḍaka.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:679;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1476">41.&nbsp;The lay devotee, his sister, had always kept looking down the road, thinking,<br>“My brother is now coming with my son.” When she saw him coming alone, she<br>thought, “My son must be dead; that is why the elder is coming alone,” and she<br>fell at&nbsp;the elder’s feet, lamenting and weeping. Suspecting that it must have&nbsp;been<br>out of fewness of wishes that the youth had gone away&nbsp;without announcing himself,<br>[93] the elder comforted her and told her all that had happened, and he took the<br>length of cloth out of his bag and showed it to her.</span></nobr></DIV>

She prostrated herself in the direction taken by&nbsp;her son,<br>and she said: “Surely the Blessed One taught the way of the Rathavinīta, the way<br>of the Nālaka, the way of the Tuvaṭaka, and the way of the great Noble Ones’<br>heritages15&nbsp;showing contentment with the four requisites and delight in<br>development, making a bhikkhu such as my son a body-witness. So, although for<br>three months he ate in the house of the mother who bore him, yet he never said ‘I<br>am your son, you are my mother!’ Oh, admirable man!” Even mother and father<br>are no impediment for one such as him, so how much less any other family that<br>supports him.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:248;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1481">43.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:248;left:23"><nobr><span class="ft1483"><i>3.&nbsp;Gain&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>is the four requisites. How are they an impediment? Wherever a</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:265;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1486">meritorious bhikkhu goes, people give&nbsp;him a large supply of requisites. With giving<br>blessings to them and teaching them the Dhamma he gets no chance to do the<br>ascetic’s duties.&nbsp;From sunrise till the first watch of the night he never breaks his<br>association with people. Again, even at&nbsp;dawn, alms-food eaters fond of opulence<br>come and say,&nbsp;“Venerable sir, such and such a man lay follower,&nbsp;woman lay follower,<br>friend, friend’s daughter, wants to see you,” and being ready to go, he replies,<br>“Take the bowl and robe, friend.” So he is always on the alert. Thus these requisites<br>are an impediment for him. He should leave&nbsp;his group and wander by&nbsp;himself<br>where he is not known. This is the way his impediment is severed.</span></nobr></DIV>

He should sever that impediment<br>in this way: if those bhikkhus have&nbsp;already acquired the main part and little still<br>remains, he should finish that off and then go to the forest. If they have&nbsp;only acquired<br>little and much still remains, [94] he should, without travelling more than a league,<br>approach another instructor of a class within the radius of a league and say,&nbsp;“Help<br>those venerable ones with instruction, etc.” If he does not find anyone in this way,<br>he should take leave&nbsp;of the class, saying. “I have&nbsp;a task to see to, friends; go where<br>it suits you,” and he should do his own work.</span></nobr></DIV>

If much<br>remains, it should be handed over to the Community or to bhikkhus who are<br>entrusted with the Community’s affairs, if it is a new building for the Community;<br>or if it is for himself, it should be handed over to those whom he entrusts with his<br>own affairs, but if these are not available, he should relinquish it to the Community<br>and depart.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:195;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1494">47.&nbsp;<i>7&nbsp;Kin&nbsp;</i>in the case of the monastery means teacher, preceptor, co-resident, pupil,<br>those with the same preceptor as oneself, and those with the same teacher as oneself;<br>and in the case of the house it means mother, father, brother, and so on. When they<br>are sick they are an impediment for him. Therefore that impediment should be<br>severed by&nbsp;curing them with nursing.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:287;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1494">48.&nbsp;Herein, when the preceptor is sick he must be cared for as long as life lasts if<br>the sickness does not soon depart.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:448;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1494">49.&nbsp;Mother and father should be treated like the preceptor; if they live&nbsp;within the<br>kingdom and look to their son for help, it should be given. [95] Also if they have&nbsp;no<br>medicine, he should give&nbsp;them his own. If he has none, he should go in search of it<br>as alms and give&nbsp;that. But in the case of brothers or sisters, one should only give<br>them what&nbsp;is theirs. If they have&nbsp;none, then one should give&nbsp;one’s own temporarily<br>and later get it back, but one should not complain if one does not get it back. It is<br>not allowed either to make medicine for or to give&nbsp;it to a sister’s husband who is<br>not related by&nbsp;blood; but one can give&nbsp;it to one’s sister saying, “Give&nbsp;it to your<br>husband.” The same applies to one’s brother’s wife.&nbsp;But it is allowed to make it for<br>their children since they are blood relatives.</span></nobr></DIV>

It is an impediment when it is actually<br>afflicting; therefore it should be severed by&nbsp;treatment with medicine.

He told bhikkhus who came for<br>recitation: “I have&nbsp;not looked at&nbsp;the scriptures for twenty years, friends, [96] yet I<br>am familiar with them.

The Community of Bhikkhus said, “‘Which teachers’ teaching is<br>it? Unless you give&nbsp;only the teaching of our own teachers we&nbsp;shall not let you<br>speak.” Also his preceptor asked him when he went to wait on him, “Did you have<br>the drum beaten, friend?”—”Yes,&nbsp;venerable sir.”—”For what&nbsp;reason?”—”I shall<br>expound the scriptures, venerable sir.”—”Friend Abhaya, how do the teachers<br>explain this passage?”—”They explain it in this way,&nbsp;venerable sir.” The elder<br>dissented, saying “Hum.” Again three times, each time in a different way,&nbsp;he said,<br>“They explain it in this way,&nbsp;venerable sir.” The elder always dissented, saying,<br>“Hum.” Then he said, “Friend, your first explanation was the way of the teachers.<br>But it is because you have&nbsp;not actually learnt it from the teachers’ lips that you are<br>unable to maintain that the teachers say such and such. Go and learn it from our<br>own teachers.”—”Where shall I go, venerable sir?”—”There is an elder named Mahā<br>Dhammarakkhita living in the Tulādhārapabbata Monastery in the Rohaṇa country<br>beyond the [Mahaveli] River.&nbsp;He knows all the scriptures. Go to him.” Saying,<br>“Good, venerable sir,” he paid homage to the elder. He went with five&nbsp;hundred<br>bhikkhus to the Elder Mahā-Dhammarakkhita, and when he had paid homage to<br>him, he sat down. The elder asked, “Why have&nbsp;you come?”—”To hear the Dhamma,<br>venerable sir.”—”Friend Abhaya, they ask me about the Dīgha and the Majjhima<br>from time to time, but I have&nbsp;not looked at&nbsp;the others for thirty years. Still you may<br>repeat them in my presence by&nbsp;night, and I shall explain them to you by&nbsp;day.” He<br>said, “Good, venerable sir,” and he acted accordingly.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:709;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1504">54.&nbsp;The inhabitants of the village had a large pavilion built at&nbsp;the door of his<br>dwelling, and they came daily to hear the Dhamma. Explaining by&nbsp;day what&nbsp;had<br>been repeated by&nbsp;night, [97] the Elder [Dhammarakkhita] eventually completed<br>the instruction. Then he sat down on a mat on the ground before the Elder Abhaya<br>and said, “Friend, explain a meditation subject to me.”—”What are you saying,<br>venerable sir, have&nbsp;I not heard it all from you? What can I explain to you that you<br>do not already know?” The senior elder said, “This path is different for one who<br>has actually travelled by.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:853;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1504">55.&nbsp;The Elder Abhaya&nbsp;was then, it seems, a stream-enterer. When the Elder Abhaya<br>had given his teacher a meditation subject, he returned to Anurādhapura. Later,</span></nobr></DIV>

So the<br>supernormal powers are an impediment that should be severed by&nbsp;one who<br>seeks insight; the others are impediments to be severed by&nbsp;one who seeks<br>concentration.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:344;left:18"><nobr><span class="ft1511">This, in the first place, is the detailed explanation of the impediments.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:366;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1516">57.&nbsp;<i>Approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation subject&nbsp;</i>(§28): meditation subjects<br>are of two kinds, that is, generally useful meditation subjects and special meditation<br>subjects.

Then towards all the principal people in the village that<br>is his alms resort; then to [all human beings there and to] all living beings<br>dependent on the human beings. With loving-kindness towards the Community<br>of Bhikkhus he produces kindliness in his co-residents; then they are easy for<br>him to live&nbsp;with. With loving-kindness towards the deities within the boundary<br>he is protected by&nbsp;kindly deities with lawful protection. [98] With loving-<br>kindness towards the principal people in the village that is his alms resort his<br>requisites are protected by&nbsp;well-disposed principal people with lawful<br>protection. With loving-kindness to all human beings there he goes about<br>without incurring their dislike since they trust him.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:51;left:314"><nobr><span class="ft1523"><i>Part 2: Concentration (Samādhi)</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:87;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1526">59.&nbsp;So these are called “generally useful” and they are “called meditation subjects”<br>since they are needed17&nbsp;generally and desirable owing to their great helpfulness<br>and since they are subjects for the meditation work&nbsp;intended.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:143;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1526">60.&nbsp;What is called a “special meditation subject” is that one from among the forty<br>meditation subjects that is suitable to a man’s own temperament. It is “special”<br>(<i>pārihāriya</i>) because he must carry it (<i>pariharitabbattā</i>) constantly about with him,<br>and because it is the proximate cause for each higher stage of development.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:217;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft1521">So it is the one who gives this twofold meditation subject that is called the&nbsp;<i>giver</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:235;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1523"><i>of a meditation subject</i>.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:257;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1521">61.&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>good friend&nbsp;</i>is one who possesses such special qualities as these:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:279;left:45"><nobr><span class="ft1526">He is revered and dearly loved,<br>And one who speaks and suffers speech;<br>The speech he utters is profound,<br>He does not urge without a reason (A IV 32) and so on.<br>He is wholly solicitous of welfare and partial to progress.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:370;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1526">62.&nbsp;Because of the words beginning, “Ánanda, it is owing to my being a good<br>friend to them that living beings subject to birth are freed from birth” (S I 88), it is<br>only the Fully Enlightened One who possesses all the aspects of the good friend.<br>Since that is so, while he is available only a meditation subject taken in the Blessed<br>One’s presence is well taken.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:462;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft1521">But after his final attainment of Nibbāna, it is proper to take it from anyone of</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:479;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1526">the eighty great disciples still living. When they are no more available, one who<br>wants to take a particular meditation subject should take it from someone with<br>cankers destroyed, who has, by&nbsp;means of that particular meditation subject,<br>produced the fourfold and fivefold jhāna, and has reached the destruction of cankers<br>by&nbsp;augmenting insight that had that jhāna as its proximate cause.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:570;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1526">63.&nbsp;But how then, does someone with cankers destroyed declare himself thus: “I am<br>one whose cankers are destroyed?” Why not? He declares himself when he knows<br>that his instructions will be carried out. Did not the Elder Assagutta [99] spread out<br>his leather mat in the air and sitting cross-legged on it explain a meditation subject to<br>a bhikkhu who was starting his meditation subject, because he knew that that bhikkhu<br>was one who would carry out his instructions for the meditation subject?</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:679;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1526">64.&nbsp;So if someone with cankers destroyed is available,&nbsp;that is good. If not, then<br>one should take it from a non-returner, a once-returner, a stream-enterer, an<br>ordinary man who has obtained jhāna, one who knows three Piṭakas, one who<br>knows two Piṭakas, one who knows one Piṭaka, in descending order [according as<br>available]. If not even one who knows one Piṭaka is available, then it should be<br>taken from one who is familiar with one Collection together with its commentary<br>and one who is himself conscientious. For a teacher such as this, who knows the<br>texts, guards the heritage, and protects the tradition, will follow the teachers’<br>opinion rather than his own. Hence the Ancient Elders said three times, “One who<br>is conscientious will guard it.”</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:87;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1534">65.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;those beginning with one whose cankers are destroyed, mentioned above,<br>will describe only the path they have&nbsp;themselves reached. But with a learned man,<br>his instructions and his answers to questions are purified by&nbsp;his having approached<br>such and such teachers, and so he will explain a meditation subject showing a<br>broad track, like a big elephant going through a stretch of jungle, and he will select<br>suttas and reasons from here and there, adding [explanations of] what&nbsp;is suitable<br>and unsuitable. So a meditation subject should be taken by&nbsp;approaching the good<br>friend such as this, the giver of a meditation subject, and by&nbsp;doing all the duties to<br>him.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:248;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1534">66.&nbsp;If he is available in the same monastery, it is good. If not, one should go to<br>where he lives.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:287;left:18"><nobr><span class="ft1531">When [a bhikkhu] goes to him, he should not do so with feet washed and</span></nobr></DIV>

When entering that monastery, he should do so [expecting nothing,<br>and even provided] with a tooth-stick that he has had made allowable on the way<br>[according to the rules]. And he should not enter some other room, thinking, “I<br>shall go to the teacher after resting awhile and after washing and anointing my<br>feet, and so on.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:465;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1534">67.&nbsp;Why? If there are bhikkhus there who are hostile to the teacher, they might<br>ask him the reason for his coming and speak dispraise of the teacher, saying, “You<br>are done for if you go to him”; [100] they might make him regret his coming and<br>turn him back. So he should ask for the teacher’s dwelling and go straight there.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:540;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1534">68.&nbsp;If the teacher is junior, he should not consent to the teacher’s receiving his<br>bowl and robe, and so on. If the teacher is senior, then he should go and pay homage<br>to him and remain standing. When told, “Put down the bowl and robe, friend,” he<br>may put them down. When told, “Have&nbsp;some water to drink,” he can drink if he<br>wants to. When told, “You may wash your feet,” he should not do so at&nbsp;once, for if<br>the water has been brought by&nbsp;the teacher himself, it would be improper. But when<br>told “Wash, friend, it was not brought by&nbsp;me, it was brought by&nbsp;others,” then he<br>can wash his feet, sitting in a screened place out of sight of the teacher, or in the<br>open to one side of the dwelling.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:701;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1534">69.&nbsp;If the teacher brings an oil tube, he should get up and take it carefully with<br>both hands. If he did not take it, it might make the teacher wonder, “Does this<br>bhikkhu resent sharing so soon?” but having taken it, he should not anoint his feet<br>at&nbsp;once. For if it were oil for anointing the teacher’s limbs, it would not be proper.<br>So he should first anoint his head, then his shoulders, etc.; but when told, “This is<br>meant for all the limbs, friend, anoint your feet,” he should put a little on his head<br>and then anoint his feet. Then he should give&nbsp;it back, saying when the teacher<br>takes it, “May I return this oil tube, venerable sir?”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:844;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1534">70.&nbsp;He should not say,&nbsp;“Explain a meditation subject to me, venerable sir” on the<br>very day he arrives.&nbsp;But starting from the next day,&nbsp;he can, if the teacher has a</span></nobr></DIV>

Herein, this is the right<br>performance of duties. He should rise early; removing his sandals and arranging<br>his robe on one shoulder, he should give&nbsp;the tooth-sticks and the mouth-washing<br>water, and he should prepare the seat.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:339;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1544">72.&nbsp;To please the teacher by&nbsp;perfection in the duties he should pay homage in the<br>evening, and he should leave&nbsp;when dismissed with the words, “You may go.” When<br>the teacher asks him, “Why have&nbsp;you come?” he can explain the reason for his<br>coming. If he does not ask but agrees to the duties being done, then after ten days<br>or a fortnight have&nbsp;gone by&nbsp;he should make an opportunity by&nbsp;staying back one<br>day at&nbsp;the time of his dismissal, and announcing the reason for his coming; or he<br>should go at&nbsp;an unaccustomed time, and when asked, “What have&nbsp;you come for?”<br>he can announce it.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:483;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1544">73.&nbsp;If the teacher says, “Come in the morning,” he should do so. But if his stomach<br>burns with a bile affliction at&nbsp;that hour, or if his food does not get digested owing<br>to sluggish digestive&nbsp;heat, or if some other ailment afflicts him, he should let it be<br>known, and proposing a time that suits himself, he should come at&nbsp;that time. For if<br>a meditation subject is expounded at&nbsp;an inconvenient time, one cannot give&nbsp;attention.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:574;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft1541">This is the detailed explanation of the words “approach the good friend, the</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:614;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1544">74.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;as to the words,&nbsp;<i>one that suits his temperament&nbsp;</i>(§28): there are six kinds of<br>temperament, that is, greedy temperament, hating temperament, deluded<br>temperament, faithful temperament, intelligent temperament, and speculative<br>temperament. Some would have&nbsp;fourteen, taking these six single ones together<br>with the four made up of the three double combinations and one triple combination<br>with the greed triad and likewise with the faith triad. But if this classification is<br>admitted, there are many more kinds of temperament possible by&nbsp;combining greed,<br>etc., with faith, etc.; therefore the kinds of temperament should be understood<br>briefly as only six. As to meaning the temperaments are one, that is to say,&nbsp;personal<br>nature, idiosyncrasy. According to [102] these there are only six types of persons,<br>that is, one of greedy temperament, one of hating temperament, one of deluded<br>temperament, one of faithful temperament, one of intelligent temperament, and<br>one of speculative&nbsp;temperament.</span></nobr></DIV>

And hate occurs in the mode of<br>condemning living beings, while understanding occurs in the mode of condemning<br>formations.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:322;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1556">77.&nbsp;One of speculative&nbsp;temperament is parallel to one of deluded temperament<br>because obstructive&nbsp;applied thoughts arise often in one of deluded temperament<br>who is striving to arouse unarisen profitable states,&nbsp;owing to their special qualities<br>being near to those of delusion. For just as delusion is restless owing to perplexity,<br>so are applied thoughts that are due to thinking over various aspects. And just as<br>delusion vacillates owing to superficiality, so do applied thoughts that are due to<br>facile conjecturing.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:448;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1556">78.&nbsp;Others say that there are three more kinds of temperament with craving, pride,<br>and views. Herein craving is simply greed; and pride18&nbsp;is associated with that, so<br>neither of them exceeds greed. And since views have&nbsp;their source in delusion, the<br>temperament of views falls within the deluded temperament.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:522;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1556">79.&nbsp;What is the source of these temperaments? And how is it to be known that<br>such a person is of greedy temperament, that such a person is of one of those<br>beginning with hating temperament?

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:579;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1556">80.&nbsp;Herein, as some say,19&nbsp;the first three kinds of temperament to begin with have<br>their source in previous habit; and they have&nbsp;their source in elements and humours.<br>Apparently one of greedy temperament has formerly had plenty of desirable tasks<br>and gratifying work&nbsp;to do, or has reappeared here after dying in a heaven.

In<br>sense, however,&nbsp;it tends to become associated with&nbsp;<i>maññati,&nbsp;</i>to conceive&nbsp;(false notions,<br>see M I 1), to imagine, to think (as e.g. at&nbsp;Nidd I 80, Vibh 390 and comy.). As one of the<br>“defilements” (see M I 36) it is probably best rendered by&nbsp;“pride.” In the expression<br><i>asmi-māna&nbsp;</i>(often rendered by&nbsp;“the pride that says ‘I am’”) it more nearly approaches<br><i>maññanā&nbsp;</i>(false imagining, misconception, see M III 246) and is better rendered by&nbsp;the<br>“conceit ‘I am,’” since the word “conceit” straddles both the meanings of “pride” (i.e.<br>haughtiness) and “conception.”<br>19.&nbsp;“<i>‘Some’&nbsp;</i>is said with reference to the Elder Upatissa. For it is put in this way by<br>him in the&nbsp;<i>Vimuttimagga</i>. The word&nbsp;<i>‘apparently’&nbsp;</i>indicates dissent from what&nbsp;follows”<br>(Vism-mhṭ 103). A similar passage to that referred to appears in Ch. 6 (Taisho ed. p.&nbsp;410a)<br>of the Chinese version of the&nbsp;<i>Vimuttimagga</i>, the only one extant.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:104;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1606">free generosity, desire to see Noble Ones, desire to hear the Good Dhamma, great<br>gladness, ingenuousness, honesty, and trust in things that inspire trust. In one of<br>intelligent temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as readiness to<br>be spoken to, possession of good friends, knowledge of the right amount in eating,<br>mindfulness and full awareness, devotion to wakefulness, a sense of urgency about<br>things that should inspire a sense of urgency, and wisely directed endeavour. In<br>one of speculative&nbsp;temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as<br>talkativeness, sociability, boredom with devotion to the profitable, failure to finish<br>undertakings, smoking by&nbsp;night and flaming by&nbsp;day (see M I 144—that is to say,<br>hatching plans at&nbsp;night and putting them into effect by&nbsp;day), and mental running<br>hither and thither (see Ud 37).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:300;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft1601">This is how the temperaments may be recognized by&nbsp;the kind of states occurring.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:322;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1606">96.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;these directions for recognizing the temperaments have&nbsp;not been handed<br>down in their entirety in either the texts or the commentaries; they are only expressed<br>according to the opinion of the teachers and cannot therefore be treated as authentic.<br>For even those of hating temperament can exhibit postures, etc., ascribed to the greedy<br>temperament when they try diligently. And postures, etc., never arise with distinct<br>characteristics in a person of mixed temperament. Only such directions for recognizing<br>temperament as are given in the commentaries should be treated as authentic; for this<br>is said: “A teacher who has acquired penetration of minds will know the temperament<br>and will explain a meditation subject accordingly; one who has not should question<br>the pupil.” So it is by&nbsp;penetration of minds or by&nbsp;questioning the person, that it can be<br>known whether he is one of greedy temperament or one of those beginning with<br>hating temperament.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:535;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft1606">97.&nbsp;<i>What suits one of what&nbsp;kind of temperament</i>? (§79). A suitable lodging for one of<br>greedy temperament has an unwashed sill and stands level with the ground, and<br>it can be either an overhanging [rock with an] unprepared [drip-ledge] (see Ch. II,<br>note 15), a grass hut, or a leaf house, etc. It ought to be spattered with dirt, full of<br>bats,24&nbsp;dilapidated, too high or too low,&nbsp;in bleak surroundings, threatened [by lions,<br>tigers, etc.,] with a muddy, uneven path, [108] where even the bed and chair are full<br>of bugs. And it should be ugly and unsightly, exciting loathing as soon as looked<br>at. Suitable inner and outer garments are those that have&nbsp;torn-off edges with threads<br>hanging down all round like a “net cake,”25&nbsp;harsh to the touch like hemp, soiled,<br>heavy and hard to wear. And the right kind of bowl for him is an ugly clay bowl<br>disfigured by&nbsp;stoppings and joints, or a heavy and misshapen iron bowl as<br>unappetizing as a skull. The right kind of road for him on which to wander for<br>alms is disagreeable, with no village near, and uneven. The right kind of village for<br>him in which to wander for alms is where people wander about as if oblivious of<br>him, where, as he is about to leave&nbsp;without getting alms even from a single family,<br>people call him into the sitting hall, saying, “Come, venerable sir,” and give&nbsp;him</span></nobr></DIV>

If the latter are extended, it is only a<br>quantity of corpses that is extended [112] and there is no benefit. And this is said in<br>answer to the question of Sopāka: “Perception of visible forms is quite clear, Blessed<br>One, perception of bones is not clear” (Source untraced29); for here the perception of<br>visible forms is called “quite clear” in the sense of extension of the sign, while the<br>perception of bones is called “not quite clear” in the sense of its non-extension.</span></nobr></DIV>

Quadrupeds grazing in their pastures drop the grass in their mouths and listen<br>to the sound. Beasts of prey hunting small animals pause with one foot raised. Hunted<br>animals lose their fear of death and halt in their tracks. Birds flying in the air stay with<br>wings outstretched. Fishes in the water keep still, not moving their fins. All listen to<br>the sound, so beautiful is the Karavīka’s song. Dhammāsoka’s queen Asandhamittā<br>asked the Community: ‘Venerable sirs, is there anything that sounds like the Buddha?’—<br>‘The Karavīka birds does.’—‘Where are those birds, venerable sirs?’—‘In the Himalaya.’</span></nobr></DIV>

Herein, these nineteen, that is to say,&nbsp;nine<br>kasiṇas omitting the air kasiṇa and the ten kinds of foulness, must be apprehended<br>by&nbsp;the seen. The meaning is that in the early stage their sign must be apprehended<br>by&nbsp;constantly looking with the eye.&nbsp;In the case of mindfulness occupied with the<br>body the five&nbsp;parts ending with skin must be apprehended by&nbsp;the seen and the rest<br>by&nbsp;the heard, so its object must be apprehended by&nbsp;the seen and the heard.<br>Mindfulness of breathing must be apprehended by&nbsp;the touched; the air kasiṇa by<br>the seen and the touched; the remaining eighteen by&nbsp;the heard. The divine abiding<br>of equanimity and the four immaterial states are not apprehendable by&nbsp;a beginner;<br>but the remaining thirty-five&nbsp;are.

The ten kasiṇas are conditions for<br>the kinds of direct-knowledge. Three divine abidings are conditions for the fourth<br>divine abiding. Each lower immaterial state is a condition for each higher one. The<br>base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is a condition for the<br>attainment of cessation. All are conditions for living in bliss, for insight, and for<br>the fortunate kinds of becoming. This is “as to condition.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:448;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft1676">121.&nbsp;<i>10.&nbsp;As to suitability to temperament</i>: here the exposition should be understood<br>according to what&nbsp;is suitable to the temperaments. That is to say: first, the ten<br>kinds of foulness and mindfulness occupied with the body are eleven meditation<br>subjects suitable for one of greedy temperament. The four divine abidings and<br>four colour kasiṇas are eight suitable for one of hating temperament. Mindfulness<br>of breathing is the one [recollection as a] meditation subject suitable for one of<br>deluded temperament and for one of speculative&nbsp;temperament. The first six<br>recollections are suitable for one of faithful temperament. Mindfulness of death,<br>the recollection of peace, the defining of the four elements, and the perception of<br>repulsiveness in nutriment, are four suitable for one of intelligent temperament.<br>The remaining kasiṇas and the immaterial states are suitable for all kinds of<br>temperament. And anyone of the kasiṇas should be limited for one of speculative<br>temperament and measureless for one of deluded temperament. This is how the<br>exposition should be understood here “as to suitability to temperament.”</span></nobr></DIV>

And<br>in doing so, he can expound it in three ways: it can be expounded to one who has<br>already learnt the meditation subject by&nbsp;having him recite it at&nbsp;one or two sessions;<br>it can be expounded to one who lives in the same place each time he comes; and to<br>one who wants to learn it and then go elsewhere it can be expounded in such a<br>manner that it is neither too brief nor too long.</span></nobr></DIV>
