(ii) The<br>volition of the seventh impulsion that accomplishes its purpose is called kamma to<br>be experienced on rebirth: it gives its result in the next selfhood.

(vii)&nbsp;<i>Death-threshold<br></i>kamma is that remembered at&nbsp;the time of death; for when a man near death can<br>remember [kamma], he is born according to that. (viii) Kamma not included in<br>the foregoing three kinds that has been often repeated is called&nbsp;<i>kamma&nbsp;</i>[<i>stored up</i>]<br><i>by being performed</i>.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:639;left:99"><nobr><span class="ft6834">“Herein, the weighty ripens first of all and that is why it is so called. When</span></nobr></DIV>

And the last<br>three when produced can be strong or weak” (Vism-mhṭ 769ff.). Vism-mhṭ then cites<br>various Birth Stories and MN 136 in order to show how,&nbsp;for various reasons, the result<br>of one kind of kamma may be delayed or displaced by&nbsp;the result of another. Vism-<br>mhṭ concludes: “This is the province of the Tathāgata’s Knowledge of the Great<br>Exposition of Kamma, in other words, the mastery of the order of ripening of such<br>and such kamma for such and such reasons.”<br>4.&nbsp;“‘Productive’ kamma is what&nbsp;produces resultant continuity by&nbsp;providing rebirth-<br>linking and so on. ‘Consolidating’ kamma prolongs the occurrence of the continuity of<br>pleasure or pain, or the endurance of materiality. ‘Frustrating’ kamma slowly diminishes<br>the endurance of pleasure or pain when they occur. It cuts off the result of other kamma<br>without giving any result of its own. ‘Supplanting’ kamma, however,&nbsp;cuts off weak kamma<br>and makes its own result arise.&nbsp;This is their difference” (Vism-mhṭ 771).</span></nobr></DIV>

But when the opportunity has thus been furnished by&nbsp;the [other] kamma,<br>it is that [supplanting kamma’s] result that is called arisen.5</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:301;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft6846">17.&nbsp;The succession of kamma and its result in the twelve classes of kamma is<br>clear in its true nature only to the Buddhas’ “knowledge of kamma and its<br>result,” which knowledge is not shared by&nbsp;disciples.6&nbsp;But the succession of<br>kamma and its result can be known in part by&nbsp;one practicing insight.
