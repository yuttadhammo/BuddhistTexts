<DIV style="position:absolute;top:93;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7895">the “noble fruit.” Its taste is experienced in two ways, that is to say,&nbsp;in its occurrence<br>in the cognitive&nbsp;series of the path, and in its occurrence in the attainment of<br>fruition. Of these, only its occurrence in the cognitive&nbsp;series of the path has been<br>shown (XXII.3f.).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:167;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7895">4.&nbsp;Furthermore, when people say that the fruit is the mere abandoning of fetters1<br>and nothing more than that, the following sutta can be cited in order to convince<br>them that they are wrong: “How is it that understanding of the tranquilizing of<br>effort is knowledge of fruit? At&nbsp;the moment of the stream-entry path right view in<br>the sense of seeing emerges from wrong view,&nbsp;and it emerges from the defilements<br>and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon that [wrong view], and<br>externally it emerges from all signs. Right view arises because of the tranquilizing<br>of that effort. This is the fruit of the path” (Paṭis I 71), and this should be given in<br>detail. Also such passages as, “The four paths and the four fruits—these states<br>have&nbsp;a measureless object” (Dhs §1408), and, “An exalted state is a condition, as<br>proximity condition, for a measureless state” (Paṭṭh II 227 (Be)), establish the<br>meaning here.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:380;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7895">5.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;in order to show how it occurs in the attainment of fruition there is<br>the following set of questions:</span></nobr></DIV>

But each one attains his<br>appropriate fruition. This is what&nbsp;has been agreed here.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:746;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7895">7.&nbsp;But there are some who say that the stream-enterer and once-returner do not<br>attain it, and that only the two above&nbsp;them attain it. The reason they give&nbsp;is that</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7916">with formations as its object.4&nbsp;And immediately next to it consciousness becomes<br>absorbed in cessation with the attainment of fruition. And here it is only fruition,<br>not path, that arises even in a trainer, because his tendency is to fruition<br>attainment.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:162;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7916">11.&nbsp;But there are those5&nbsp;who say that when a stream-enterer embarks on insight,<br>thinking, “I shall attain fruition attainment,” he becomes a once-returner, and a<br>once-returner, a non-returner. They should be told: “In that case a non-returner<br>becomes an Arahant and an Arahant, a Paccekabuddha and a Paccekabuddha,<br>a Buddha. For that reason, and because it is contradicted as well by&nbsp;the text<br>quoted above, none of that should be accepted. Only this should be accepted:<br>fruition itself, not path, arises also in the trainer. And if the path he has arrived<br>at&nbsp;had the first jhāna, his fruition will have&nbsp;the first jhāna too when it arises. If<br>the path has the second, so will the fruition. And so with the other jhānas.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:323;left:28"><nobr><span class="ft7910">This, firstly, is how attaining comes about. [701]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:345;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7916">12.&nbsp;(vi) It is made to last in three ways, because of the words: “Friend, there are<br>three conditions for the persistence of the signless mind-deliverance: they are<br>the non-bringing to mind of all signs, the bringing to mind of the signless<br>element, and the&nbsp;<i>prior volition</i>” (M I 296–97). Herein, the prior volition is the<br>predetermining of the time before attaining;6&nbsp;for it is by&nbsp;determining it thus, “I<br>shall emerge at&nbsp;such a time,” that it lasts until that time comes. This is how it is<br>made to last.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:471;left:43"><nobr><span class="ft7910">(vii) Emergence from it comes about in two ways, because of the words:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:489;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7916">“Friend, there are two conditions for the emergence from the signless mind-<br>deliverance: they are the bringing to mind of all signs, and the non-bringing to<br>mind of the signless element” (M I 297). Herein, of all signs means the sign of<br>materiality, sign of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness. Of course,<br>a man does not bring all those to mind at&nbsp;once, but this is said in order to include<br>all. So the emergence from the attainment of fruition comes about in him when<br>he brings to mind whatever is the object of the life-continuum.7</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:615;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7916">14.&nbsp;(viii)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What is next to fruition</i>? (ix)&nbsp;<i>What is fruition next to</i>?

But<br>(ix) there is fruition that is (a) next to the path, (b) there is that next to fruition, (c)<br>there is that&nbsp;next to change-of-lineage, and (d) there is that next to the base<br>consisting of neither perception nor non-perception.</span></nobr></DIV>

Since it is not perfected they are<br>not, owing to want of power,&nbsp;able to attain the attainment of cessation, which has<br>to be attained by&nbsp;the two powers. But it is abandoned in the non-returner and so<br>his power is perfected. Since his power is perfected he is able to attain it.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:53;left:326"><nobr><span class="ft7962"><i>Part 3: Understanding (Paññā)</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft7966">29.&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;<i>Where do they attain it</i>? In the five-constituent becoming. Why? Because<br>of the necessity for the succession of [all] the attainments (cf. S IV 217). But in the<br>four-constituent becoming there is no arising of the first jhāna, etc., and so it is<br>not possible to attain it there. But some say that is because of the lack of a physical<br>basis [for the mind there].12</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft7966">30.&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;<i>Why do they attain it</i>? Being wearied by&nbsp;the occurrence and dissolution<br>of formations, they attain it thinking, “Let us dwell in bliss by&nbsp;being without<br>consciousness here and now and reaching the cessation that is Nibbāna.”13</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:236;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft7966">31.&nbsp;(vi)&nbsp;<i>How does its attainment come about</i>? It comes about in one who performs<br>the preparatory tasks by&nbsp;striving with serenity and insight and causes the<br>cessation of [consciousness belonging to] the base consisting of neither<br>perception nor non-perception. One who strives with serenity alone reaches the<br>base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception and remains there, while<br>one who strives with insight alone reaches the attainment of fruition and remains<br>there. But it is one who strives with both, and after performing the preparatory tasks,<br>causes the cessation of [consciousness belonging to] the base consisting of neither<br>perception nor non-perception, who attains it. This is in brief.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:397;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft7966">32.&nbsp;But the detail is this. When a bhikkhu who desires to attain cessation has<br>finished all that has to do with his meal and has washed his hands and feet<br>well, he sits down on a well-prepared seat in a secluded place. Having folded<br>his legs crosswise, set his body erect, established mindfulness in front of him, he<br>attains the first jhāna, and on emerging he sees the formations in it with insight<br>as impermanent, painful, not-self.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:506;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft7966">33.&nbsp;This insight is threefold as insight that discerns formations, insight for the<br>attainment of fruition, and insight for the attainment of cessation. Herein, insight<br>that discerns formations, whether sluggish or keen, is the proximate cause only for<br>a path. Insight for the attainment of fruition, which is only valid when keen, is<br>similar to that for the development of a path. Insight for the attainment of cessation<br>is only valid when it is not over-sluggish and not over-keen. Therefore he sees those<br>formations with insight that is not over-sluggish and not over-keen.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:633;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft7966">34.&nbsp;After that, he attains the second jhāna, and on emerging he sees formations<br>with insight in like manner. After that, he attains the third jhāna … (etc.) … After<br>that, he attains the base consisting of boundless consciousness, and on emerging<br>he sees the formations in it in like manner. Likewise he attains the base consisting</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:721;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft7967">12.&nbsp;“They say so because of absence of heart-basis; but the meaning is because of<br>absence of basis called physical body. For if anyone were to attain cessation in the<br>immaterial worlds he would become indefinable (<i>appaññattika</i>) owing to the non-<br>existence of any consciousness or consciousness concomitant at&nbsp;all, and he would be<br>as though attained to final Nibbāna without remainder of results of past clinging; for<br>what&nbsp;remainder of results of past clinging could be predicated of him when he had<br>entered into cessation? So it is because of the lack of the necessary factors that there<br>is no attaining of the attainment of cessation in the immaterial worlds” (Vism-mhṭ<br>902).<br>13.&nbsp;“‘<i>Reaching the cessation that is Nibbāna</i>’: as though reaching Nibbāna without<br>remainder of result of past clinging. ‘In bliss’ means without suffering” (Vism-mhṭ 902).</span></nobr></DIV>

[706]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:145;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7970">35.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:145;left:43"><nobr><span class="ft7970">(a) Herein,&nbsp;<i>non-damage to others’ property</i>&nbsp;refers to what&nbsp;the bhikkhu has</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:162;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7976">about him that is not his personal property: a robe and bowl, or a bed and chair,<br>or a living room, or any other kind of requisite kept by him but the property of<br>various others. It should be resolved14&nbsp;that such property will not be damaged,<br>will not be destroyed by&nbsp;fire, water, wind, thieves,&nbsp;rats, and so on. Here is the form<br>of the resolve: “During these seven days let this and this not be burnt by&nbsp;fire; let<br>it not be swept off by&nbsp;water; let it not be spoilt by&nbsp;wind; let it not be stolen by<br>thieves; let it not be devoured by&nbsp;rats, and so on.” When he has resolved in this<br>way,&nbsp;they are not in danger during the seven days.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:306;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7976">36.&nbsp;If he does not resolve in this way,&nbsp;they may be destroyed by&nbsp;fire, etc., as in the<br>case of the Elder Mahā Nāga. The elder, it seems, went for alms into the village<br>where his mother, a lay follower,&nbsp;lived. She gave&nbsp;him rice gruel and seated him in<br>the sitting hall. The elder sat down and attained cessation. While he was sitting<br>there the hall caught fire. The other bhikkhus each picked up their seats and<br>fled. The villagers gathered together, and seeing the elder, they said, “What a<br>lazy monk! What a lazy monk!” The fire burned the grass thatch, the bamboos,<br>and timbers, and it encircled the elder. People brought water and put it out. They<br>removed the ashes, did repairs,15&nbsp;scattered flowers, and then stood respectfully<br>waiting. The elder emerged at&nbsp;the time he had determined. Seeing them, he said,<br>“I am discovered!,” and he rose up into the air and went to Piyaṅgu Island. This<br>is “non-damage to others’ property.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:519;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7970">37.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:519;left:43"><nobr><span class="ft7970">There is no special resolving to be done for what&nbsp;is his own personal</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:537;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7976">property such as the inner and outer robes or the seat he is sitting on. He protects<br>all that by&nbsp;means of the attainment itself, like those of the venerable Sañjīva. And<br>this is said: “There was success by&nbsp;intervention of concentration in the venerable<br>Sañjīva. There was success by&nbsp;intervention of concentration in the venerable<br>Sāriputta” (Paṭis I 212—see XII.30).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:628;left:43"><nobr><span class="ft7970">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Community’s waiting</i>&nbsp;is the Community’s expecting. The meaning</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:645;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7976">is: till this bhikkhu comes there is no carrying out of acts of the Community. And<br>here it is not the actual Community’s waiting that is the preparatory task, but the<br>adverting to the waiting. So it should be adverted to in this way: “While I am<br>sitting for seven days in the attainment of cessation, if the Community wants to<br>enact a resolution, etc., I shall emerge before any bhikkhu comes to summon<br>me.” [707] One who attains it after doing this emerges at&nbsp;exactly that time.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:769;left:41"><nobr><span class="ft7974">“‘<i>It should be resolved</i>’: the thought should be aroused. For here the resolve</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:785;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7977">consists in arousing the thought. In the non-arising of consciousness-originated<br>materiality, etc., and in the absence of support by&nbsp;a postnascence condition, etc., the<br>physical body continues the same only for seven days; after that it suffers wastage. So<br>he limits the duration to seven days when he attains cessation, they say”<br>(Vism-mhṭ 903).<br>15.&nbsp;<i>Paribhaṇḍa—</i>“repair work”: this meaning is not given in PED; cf. M-a IV 157<br>(patching of old robes), and M-a I 291.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:558;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft7993">47.&nbsp;Just as when a man who has travelled that road before comes to that place,<br>he puts his inner garment on securely, and taking the other in his hand, crosses<br>over the ravine, or so acts as to tread only lightly on the hot rock and accordingly<br>gets to the other side, so too, when the bhikkhu does the preparatory task and<br>then attains the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, then<br>he achieves cessation, which is the other side,&nbsp;by&nbsp;becoming without<br>consciousness.</span></nobr></DIV>

It is<br>not classifiable as formed or unformed, mundane or supramundane. Why?<br>Because it has no individual essence. But since it comes to be attained by&nbsp;one<br>who attains it, it is therefore permissible to say that it is produced, not<br>unproduced.18</span></nobr></DIV>

Besides, they are produced (<i>nipphanna</i>) as well. For among<br>the dhammas that are individual essences (<i>sabhāva-dhamma</i>) it is only Nibbāna that is<br>un-positively-produced and un-produced (<i>anipphanna</i>).” The&nbsp;<i>Mūla Þīkā</i>&nbsp;comments on<br>this: “What is the difference between the positively-produced and the produced? A<br>dhamma that is an individual essence with a beginning and an end in time, produced<br>by&nbsp;conditions, and marked by&nbsp;the three characteristics, is&nbsp;<i>positively produced</i>. But<br>besides this, what&nbsp;is&nbsp;<i>produced</i>&nbsp;[but not positively produced] is a dhamma with no<br>individual essence (<i>asabhāva-dhamma</i>) when it is produced by the taking of a name or<br>by&nbsp;attaining [the attainment of cessation]” (Vibh-a 23).
