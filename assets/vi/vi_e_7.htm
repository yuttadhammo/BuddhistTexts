<DIV style="position:absolute;top:276;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2293">17.&nbsp;Besides, robbers may meet there thinking a charnel ground a safe place for<br>them whether or not they have&nbsp;done anything wrong.

When he has<br>done this, he characterizes the bloated sign of foulness by&nbsp;the fact of its having<br>attained that particular individual essence. (see §84) Then he sees that the sign<br>is properly apprehended, that it is properly remembered, that it is properly<br>defined, by&nbsp;its colour, by&nbsp;its mark, by&nbsp;its shape, by&nbsp;its direction, by&nbsp;its location, by<br>its delimitation, by&nbsp;its joints, by&nbsp;its openings, by&nbsp;its concavities, by&nbsp;its convexities,<br>and all round.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft2305">22.&nbsp;“When he has established reverence for it by&nbsp;seeing its advantages and by<br>perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love&nbsp;it, he anchors his mind upon that<br>object: ‘Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and death.’ Quite<br>secluded from sense desires, secluded from unprofitable things he enters upon<br>and dwells in the first jhāna&nbsp;<i>…</i>&nbsp;[seclusion].

His is a heavenly abiding and an instance of the meritorious<br>action consisting in [meditative] development.” (<i>Source untraced.</i>)</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:306;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft2305">23.&nbsp;So if he goes to the charnel ground to test his control of mind, let him do so<br>after striking the gong or summoning a chapter. If he goes there mainly for<br>[developing that] meditation subject, let him go alone with no companion, without<br>renouncing his basic meditation subject and keeping it always in mind, taking<br>a walking stick or a staff to keep off attacks by&nbsp;dogs, etc., [182] ensuring<br>unremitting mindfulness by&nbsp;establishing it well, with his mind not turned<br>outwards because he has ensured that his faculties, of which his mind is the<br>sixth, are turned inwards.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:450;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft2305">24.&nbsp;As he goes out of the monastery he should note the gate: “I have&nbsp;gone out in<br>such a direction by&nbsp;such a gate.” After that he should define the path by&nbsp;which he<br>goes: “This path goes in an easterly direction&nbsp;<i>…</i>&nbsp;westerly&nbsp;<i>…</i>&nbsp;northerly&nbsp;<i>…</i>&nbsp;southerly<br>direction” or “It goes in an intermediate direction”; and “In this place it goes to the<br>left, in this place to the right”; and “In this place there is a stone, in this a termite-<br>mound, in this a tree, in this a bush, in this a creeper.” He should go to the place<br>where the sign is, defining in this way the path by&nbsp;which he goes.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:576;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft2305">25.&nbsp;And he should not approach it upwind; for if he did so and the smell of<br>corpses assailed his nose, his brain3&nbsp;might get upset, or he might throw&nbsp;up his<br>food, or he might repent his coming, thinking “What a place of corpses I have<br>come to!” So instead of approaching it upwind, he should go downwind. If he<br>cannot go by&nbsp;a downwind path—if there is a mountain or a ravine or a rock or a<br>fence or a patch of thorns or water or a bog in the way—then he should go<br>stopping his nose with the corner of his robe. These are the duties in going.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:702;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft2305">26.&nbsp;When he has gone there in this way,&nbsp;he should not at&nbsp;once look at&nbsp;the sign<br>of foulness; he should make sure of the direction. For perhaps if he stands in a<br>certain direction, the object does not appear clearly to him and his mind is not<br>wieldy. So rather than there he should stand where the object appears clearly<br>and his mind is wieldy. And he should avoid standing to leeward or to windward<br>of it. For if he stands to leeward he is bothered by&nbsp;the corpse smell and his mind<br>strays; and if he stands to windward and non-human beings are dwelling there,</span></nobr></DIV>

For among the thirty-eight meditation subjects expounded in the<br>texts no object is so frightening as this one. There are some who lose jhāna in<br>this meditation subject. Why?

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2350">57.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:43"><nobr><span class="ft2350">So the meditator must stand firm. Establishing his mindfulness well, he</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:105;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2356">should remove&nbsp;his fears in this way: “No dead body gets up and pursues one. If<br>that stone or that creeper close to it were to come, the body might come too; but<br>since that stone or that creeper does not come, the body will not come either. Its<br>appearance to you in this way is born: of your perception, created by&nbsp;your<br>perception. Today&nbsp;your meditation subject has appeared to you. Do not be afraid,<br>bhikkhu.” He should laugh it off and direct his mind to the sign. In that way he<br>will arrive&nbsp;at&nbsp;distinction. The words “Characterizing the surrounding signs<br>has non-delusion for its purpose” are said on this account.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2357">58.&nbsp;To succeed in apprehending the sign in the eleven ways is to anchor the<br>meditation subject. For the opening of his eyes and looking conditions the arising<br>of the learning sign; and as he exercises his mind on that the counterpart sign<br>arises; and as he exercises his mind on that he reaches absorption. When he is<br>sure of absorption, he works up insight and realizes Arahantship. Hence it was<br>said:&nbsp;<i>apprehending the sign in the&nbsp;</i>[<i>other</i>]&nbsp;<i>eleven ways has anchoring&nbsp;</i>[<i>the mind</i>]&nbsp;<i>for its<br>purpose</i>.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:375;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2356">59.&nbsp;<i>The reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping&nbsp;</i>[<i>the mind</i>]&nbsp;<i>on the track<br>for its purpose</i>: the meaning is that the reviewing of the path gone by&nbsp;and of the<br>path come back by&nbsp;mentioned is for the purpose of keeping properly to the track<br>of the meditation subject.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:450;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2356">60.&nbsp;For if this bhikkhu is going along with his meditation subject and people<br>on the way ask him about the day,&nbsp;“What is today,&nbsp;venerable sir?” or they ask him<br>some question [about Dhamma], or they welcome him, he ought not to go on in<br>silence, thinking “I have&nbsp;a meditation subject.” The day must be told, the question<br>must be answered, even by&nbsp;saying “I do not know” if he does not know,&nbsp;a legitimate<br>welcome must be responded to. [188] As he does so, the newly acquired sign<br>vanishes. But even if it does vanish, he should still tell the day when asked; if he<br>does not know the answer to the question, he should still say “I do not know,”<br>and if he does know it, he should explain it surely;10&nbsp;and he must respond to a<br>welcome. Also reception of visitors must be attended to on seeing a visiting<br>bhikkhu, and all the remaining duties in the Khandhakas must be carried out<br>too, that is, the duties of the shrine terrace, the duties of the Bodhi-tree terrace, the<br>duties of the Uposatha house, the duties of the refectory and the bath house, and<br>those to the teacher,&nbsp;the preceptor, visitors, departing bhikkhus, and the rest.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:698;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2356">61.&nbsp;And the newly acquired sign vanishes while he is carrying out these too.<br>When he wants to go again, thinking “I shall go and take up the sign,” he finds<br>he cannot go to the charnel ground because it has been invaded by&nbsp;non-human<br>beings or by&nbsp;wild beasts, or the sign has disappeared. For a bloated corpse only<br>lasts one or two days and then turns into a livid corpse. Of all the meditation<br>subjects there is none so hard to come by&nbsp;as this.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:807;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2356">62.&nbsp;So when the sign has vanished in this way,&nbsp;the bhikkhu should sit down in<br>his night quarters or in his day quarters and first of all review the path gone by<br>and come by up to the place where he is actually sitting cross-legged, doing it in</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:33"><nobr><span class="ft2360">As he reviews it in this way,&nbsp;the sign becomes evident and appears as if</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft2364">placed in front of him; the meditation subject rides in its track as it did before.<br>Hence it was said:<i>&nbsp;the reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping&nbsp;</i>[<i>the<br>mind</i>]&nbsp;<i>on the track for its purpose</i>.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:306;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft2363">64.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;as to the words, when he has established reverence for it by&nbsp;seeing its<br>advantages and by&nbsp;perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love&nbsp;it, he anchors<br>the mind on that object: here, having gained jhāna by&nbsp;exercising his mind on the<br>repulsiveness in the bloated, he should increase insight with the jhāna as its<br>proximate cause, and then he should see the advantages in this way: [189]<br>“Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and death.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:415;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft2363">65.&nbsp;Just as a pauper who acquired a treasure of gems would guard and love&nbsp;it<br>with great affection, feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of<br>it, “I have&nbsp;got what&nbsp;is hard indeed to get!” so too [this bhikkhu] should guard<br>the sign, loving it and feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of<br>it, “I have&nbsp;got this meditation subject, which is indeed as hard to get as a very<br>valuable treasure is for a pauper to get. For one whose meditation subject is the<br>four elements discerns the four primary elements in himself, one whose meditation<br>subject is breathing discerns the wind in his own nostrils, and one whose<br>meditation subject is a kasiṇa makes a kasiṇa and develops it at&nbsp;his ease, so these<br>other meditation subjects are easily got. But this one lasts only one, or two days,<br>after which it turns into a livid corpse. There is none harder to get than this<br>one.” In his night quarters and in his day quarters he should keep his mind<br>anchored there thus, “Repulsiveness of the bloated, repulsiveness of the bloated.”<br>And he should advert to the sign, bring it to mind and strike&nbsp;at&nbsp;it with thought<br>and applied thought over and over again.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:680;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft2363">66.&nbsp;As he does so, the counterpart sign arises. Here is the difference between<br>the two signs.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:754;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft2360">67.</span></nobr></DIV>

[192] So he should go in the way<br>already described to where it has been put, and noticing any stones, etc., with<br>their surrounding signs and in relation, to the object, he should characterize it<br><i>by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essence</i>&nbsp;thus, “This is a<br>skeleton,” and he should apprehend the sign in the eleven ways by&nbsp;colour and<br>the rest. But if he looks at&nbsp;it, [apprehending it only] by&nbsp;its colour as white, it does<br>not appear to him [with its individual essence as repulsive], but only as a variant<br>of the white kasiṇa. Consequently he should only look at&nbsp;it as ‘a skeleton’ in the<br>repulsive&nbsp;aspect.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2393">79.&nbsp;“Mark” is a term for the hand, etc., here, so he should define it&nbsp;<i>by its mark<br></i>according to hand, foot, head, chest, arm, waist, thigh, and shin. He should<br>define it&nbsp;<i>by its shape</i>, however,&nbsp;according as it is long, short, square, round, small<br>or large.&nbsp;<i>By its direction and by its location</i>&nbsp;are as already described (§39–40).<br>Having defined it&nbsp;<i>by its delimitation</i>&nbsp;according to the periphery of each bone, he<br>should reach absorption by&nbsp;apprehending whichever appears most evident to<br>him. But it can also be defined&nbsp;<i>by its concavities</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>by its convexities</i>&nbsp;according to<br>the concave&nbsp;and convex places in each bone. And it can also be defined by<br>position thus: “I am standing in a concave&nbsp;place, the skeleton is in a convex<br>place; or I am standing in a convex place, the skeleton is in a concave&nbsp;place.” It<br>should be defined&nbsp;<i>by its joints</i>&nbsp;according as any two bones are joined together. It<br>should be defined&nbsp;<i>by its openings</i>&nbsp;according to the gaps separating the bones. It<br>should be defined&nbsp;<i>all round&nbsp;</i>by&nbsp;directing knowledge to it comprehensively thus:<br>“In this place there is this skeleton.” If the sign does not arise even in this way,<br>then the mind should be established on the frontal bone. And in this case, just as<br>in the case of those that precede it beginning with the worm-infested, the<br>apprehending of the sign should be observed in this elevenfold manner as<br>appropriate.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:567;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2393">80.&nbsp;This meditation subject is successful with a whole skeleton frame and even<br>with a single bone as well. So having learnt the sign in anyone of these in the<br>eleven ways, he should bring it to mind as “Repulsiveness of a skeleton,<br>repulsiveness of a skeleton.” Here the learning sign and the counterpart sign<br>are alike,&nbsp;so it is said. That is correct for a single bone. But when the learning<br>sign becomes manifest in a skeleton frame, what&nbsp;is correct [to say] is that there<br>are gaps in the learning sign while the counterpart sign appears whole. [193]<br>And the learning sign even in a single bone should be dreadful and terrifying<br>but the counterpart sign produces happiness and joy because it brings access.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:728;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2390">81.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:728;left:43"><nobr><span class="ft2390">What is said in the Commentaries in this context allows that deduction.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:745;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft2393">For there, after saying this, “There is no counterpart sign in the four divine<br>abidings and in the ten kinds of foulness; for in the case of the divine abidings<br>the sign is the breaking down of boundaries itself, and in the case of the ten<br>kinds of foulness the sign comes into being as soon as the repulsiveness is seen,<br>without any thinking about it,” it is again said, immediately next: “Here the<br>sign is twofold: the learning sign and the counterpart sign. The learning sign<br>appears hideous, dreadful and terrifying,” and so on. So what&nbsp;we&nbsp;said was well<br>considered. And it is only this that is correct here.
