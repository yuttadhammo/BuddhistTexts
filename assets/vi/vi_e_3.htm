For when his virtue is thus washed clean of stains by&nbsp;the<br>waters of such special qualities as fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement,<br>seclusion, dispersal, energy, and modest needs, it will become quite purified; and<br>his vows will succeed as well. And– so, when his whole behaviour has been purified<br>by&nbsp;the special quality of blameless virtue and vows and he has become established<br>in the [first] three of the ancient Noble Ones’ heritages, he may become worthy to<br>attain to the fourth called “delight in development” (A II 27).

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:217;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft1141">i.&nbsp;It is “refuse” (<i>paṃsukūla</i>) since, owing to its being found on refuse in any</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:235;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft1146">such place as a street, a charnel ground, or a midden, it belongs, as it were, to the<br>refuse in the sense of being dumped in anyone of these places.&nbsp;Or alternatively:<br>like refuse it gets to a vile state (<i>PAṂSU viya KUcchitabhāvaṃ ULAti</i>), thus it is<br>“refuse” (<i>paṃsukūla</i>); it goes to a vile state, is what&nbsp;is meant. The wearing of a<br>refuse-[rag], which has acquired its derivative&nbsp;name1&nbsp;in this way,&nbsp;is “refuse-[rag-<br>wearing]” (<i>paṃsukūla</i>). That is his habit, thus he is a “refuse-[rag-wear-]er”<br>(<i>paṃsukūlika</i>). The practice (<i>aṅga</i>) of the refuse-[rag-wear-]er is the “refuse-[rag-<br>wear-]er’s practice” (<i>paṃsukūlikaṅga</i>). It is the action that is called the “practice.”<br>Therefore it should be understood as a term for that by&nbsp;undertaking which one<br>becomes a refuse-[rag-wear-]er.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:413;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft1141">ii.&nbsp;In the same way,&nbsp;he has the habit of [wearing] the triple robe (<i>ti-cīvara</i>)—in</span></nobr></DIV>

He gleans that alms food (that<br>falling of lumps), he seeks it by&nbsp;approaching such and such a family, thus he is<br>called an “alms-food [eat-]er” (<i>piṇḍapātika</i>). Or his vow is to gather (<i>patituṃ</i>)2&nbsp;the<br>lump (<i>piṇḍa</i>), thus he is a “lump-gatherer” (<i>piṇḍapātin</i>). To “gather” is to wander<br>for.&nbsp;A “lump-gatherer” (<i>piṇḍapātin</i>) is the same as an “alms-food-eater” (<i>piṇḍapātika</i>).<br>The practice of the alms-food-eater is the “alms-food-eater’s practice.”</span></nobr></DIV>

His habit is<br>to wander on what-is-with-the-gapless, thus he is a “gapless wanderer” (<i>sapadāna-<br>cārin</i>). A gapless wanderer is the same as a “house-to-house-seeker” (<i>sapadāna-<br>cārika</i>). His practice is the “house-to-house-seeker’s practice.”</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:161;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1155">8.&nbsp;vii.&nbsp;“No” (<i>khalu</i>) is a particle in the sense of refusing. [61] Food (<i>bhatta</i>) obtained<br>later by&nbsp;one who has shown that he is satisfied is called “later-food” (<i>pacchā-bhatta</i>).<br>The eating of that later food is “later-food-eating.” Making “later-food” (<i>pacchā-<br>bhatta</i>) the name for that later-food-eating: later-food is his habit, thus he is a “later-<br>food-[eat-]er” (<i>pacchābhattika</i>). Not a later-food-eater is a “no-later-food-[eat-]er”<br>(<i>khalu-pacchābhattika</i>), [that is, a “later-food-refuser”]. This is the name for one who<br>as an undertaking refuses extra food. But it is said in the commentary4&nbsp;“Khalu is a<br>certain kind of bird. When it has taken a fruit into its beak and that drops, it does<br>not eat any more. This [bhikkhu] is like that.” Thus he is “a later-food-refuser”<br>(<i>khalu-pacchā-bhattika</i>). His practice is the “later-food-refuser’s practice.”</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:87;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1196">23.&nbsp;ii.&nbsp;Next there is the&nbsp;<i>triple-robe-wearer’s practice</i>. This is undertaken with one<br>of the following statements: “I refuse a fourth robe” or “I undertake the triple-<br>robe-wearer’s practice.” [65]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:143;left:28"><nobr><span class="ft1191">When a triple-robe wearer has got cloth for a robe, he can put it by&nbsp;for as long</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:161;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1196">as, owing to ill-health, he is unable to make it up, or for as long as he does not find<br>a helper, or lacks a needle, etc., and there is no fault in his putting it by. But it is not<br>allowed to put it by&nbsp;once it has been dyed. That is called cheating the ascetic practice.<br>These are the&nbsp;<i>directions</i>&nbsp;for it.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:235;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1196">24.&nbsp;This too has three&nbsp;<i>grades</i>. Herein, one who is strict should, at&nbsp;the time of dyeing,<br>first dye either the inner cloth or the upper garment, and having dyed it, he should<br>wear that round the waist and dye the other. Then he can put that on over the<br>shoulder and dye the cloak of patches. But he is not allowed to wear the cloak of<br>patches round the waist. This is the duty when in an abode inside a village. But it<br>is allowable for him in the forest to wash and dye two together. However,&nbsp;he should<br>sit in a place near [to the robes] so that, if he sees anyone, he can pull a yellow cloth<br>over himself. But for the medium one there is a yellow cloth in the dyeing room for<br>use while dyeing, and it is allowable for him to wear that [as an inner cloth] or to<br>put it on [as an upper garment] in order to do the work&nbsp;of dyeing. For the mild one<br>it is allowable to wear, or put on, the robes of bhikkhus who are in communion (i.e.<br>not suspended, etc.) in order to do the work&nbsp;of dyeing. A bedspread that remains<br>where it is10&nbsp;is also allowable for him, but he must not take it about him. And it is<br>allowed for him to use from time to time the robes of bhikkhus who are in<br>communion. It is allowed to one who wears the triple robe as an ascetic practice to<br>have&nbsp;a yellow shoulder-cloth too as a fourth; but it must be only a span wide and<br>three hands long.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:535;left:28"><nobr><span class="ft1191">The moment anyone of these three agrees to [accept] a fourth robe, his ascetic</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:552;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1191">practice is broken. This is the&nbsp;<i>breach</i>&nbsp;in this instance.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:574;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1196">25.&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>benefits</i>&nbsp;are these. The bhikkhu who is a triple-robe wearer is content<br>with the robe as a protection for the body. Hence he goes taking it with him as a<br>bird does its wings (M I 180); and such special qualities as having few undertakings,<br>avoidance of storage of cloth, a frugal existence, the abandoning of greed for many<br>robes, living in effacement by&nbsp;observing moderation even in what&nbsp;is permitted,<br>production of the fruits of fewness of wishes, etc., are perfected. [66]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:683;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1191">26.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:683;left:118"><nobr><span class="ft1196">No risk of hoarding haunts the man of wit<br>Who wants no extra cloth for requisite;<br>Using the triple robe where’er he goes<br>The pleasant relish of content he knows.</span></nobr></DIV>

They say accordingly (it is said in a commentary) that there&nbsp;is no breach of the<br>ascetic practice even when these two,&nbsp;that is, the bedspread and the undyed cloth, are<br>kept as extra robes” (Vism-mhṭ 78–79).

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:51;left:400"><nobr><span class="ft1253"><i>The Ascetic Practices</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:87;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1254">48.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;that forest dweller must leave&nbsp;an abode in a village in order to meet the<br>dawn in the forest. Herein, a village abode is the village itself with its precincts. A<br>“village” may consist of one cottage or several cottages, it may be enclosed by&nbsp;a<br>wall or not, have&nbsp;human inhabitants or not, and it can also be a caravan that is<br>inhabited for more than four months. [72] The “village precincts” cover the range<br>of a stone thrown by&nbsp;a man of medium stature standing between the gate-posts of<br>a walled village, if there are two gate-posts, as at&nbsp;Anurādhapura (cf. Vin III 46). The<br>Vinaya&nbsp;experts say that this [stone’s throw] is characterized as up to the place<br>where a thrown stone falls, as, for instance, when young men exercise their arms<br>and throw&nbsp;stones in order to show off their strength. But the Suttanta experts say<br>that it is up to where one thrown to scare crows normally falls. In the case of an<br>unwalled village, the house precinct is where the water falls when a woman standing<br>in the door of the outermost house of all throws water from a basin. Within a<br>stone’s throw&nbsp;of the kind already described from that point is the village. Within a<br>second stone’s throw&nbsp;is the village precinct.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:352;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1254">49.&nbsp;“Forest,” according to the Vinaya&nbsp;method firstly, is described thus: “Except<br>the village and its precincts, all is forest” (Vin III 46). According to the Abhidhamma<br>method it is described thus: “Having gone out beyond the boundary post, all that<br>is forest” (Vibh 251; Paṭis I 176). But according to the Suttanta method its<br>characteristic is this: “A forest abode is five&nbsp;hundred bow-lengths distant” (Vin IV<br>183). That should be defined by&nbsp;measuring it with a strung instructor’s bow from<br>the gate-post of a walled village, or from the range of the first stone’s throw&nbsp;from<br>an unwalled one, up to the monastery wall.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:496;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1254">50.&nbsp;But if the monastery is not walled, it is said in the Vinaya&nbsp;commentaries, it<br>should be measured by&nbsp;making the first dwelling of all the limit, or else the refectory<br>or regular meeting place or Bodhi Tree or shrine, even if that is far from a dwelling<br>[belonging to the monastery]. But in the Majjhima commentary it is said that,<br>omitting the precincts of the monastery and the village, the distance to be measured<br>is that between where the two stones fall. This is the measure here.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:605;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1254">51.&nbsp;Even if the village is close by&nbsp;and the sounds of men are audible to people in<br>the monastery, still if it is not possible to go straight to it because of rocks, rivers,<br>etc., in between, the five&nbsp;hundred bow-lengths can be reckoned by&nbsp;that road even if<br>one has to go by&nbsp;boat. But anyone who blocks the path to the village here and there<br>for the purpose of [lengthening it so as to be able to say that he is] taking up the<br>practice is cheating the ascetic practice.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:714;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1254">52.&nbsp;If a forest-dwelling bhikkhu’s preceptor or teacher is ill and does not get<br>what&nbsp;he needs in the forest, [73] he should take him to a village abode and attend<br>him there. But he should leave&nbsp;in time to meet the dawn in a place proper for the<br>practice. If the affliction increases towards the time of dawn, he must attend him<br>and not bother about the purity of his ascetic practice. These are the&nbsp;<i>directions</i>.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:805;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft1254">53.&nbsp;This too has three&nbsp;<i>grades</i>. Herein, one who is strict must always meet the dawn<br>in the forest. The medium one is allowed to live&nbsp;in a village for the four months of<br>the Rains. And the mild one, for the winter months too.</span></nobr></DIV>

And he should first inform the senior<br>elder of the Order or the king’s local representative&nbsp;in order to prevent trouble.<br>When he walks up and down, he should do so looking at&nbsp;the pyre with half an eye.<br>[77] On his way to the charnel ground he should avoid the main roads and take a<br>by-path.

He should not take such foods as sesame flour, pease pudding,<br>fish, meat, milk, oil, sugar, etc., which are liked by&nbsp;non-human beings.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:51;left:397"><nobr><span class="ft1343"><i>Part 1: Virtue (Sīla)</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:87;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft1344">together with the five&nbsp;individual practices, that is to say,&nbsp;the forest-dweller’s practice,<br>the refuse-rag-wearer’s practice, the triple-robe-wearer’s practice, the sitter’s<br>practice, and the charnel-ground-dweller’s practice, come to eight only.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:143;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft1344">88.&nbsp;Again they come to four, that is to say,&nbsp;two connected with robes, five&nbsp;connected<br>with alms food, five&nbsp;connected with the resting place, and one connected with<br>energy. Herein, it is the sitter’s practice that is connected with energy; the rest are<br>obvious.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:217;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft1341">Again they all amount to two only, since twelve are dependent on requisites</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:235;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft1344">and one on energy. Also they are two according to what&nbsp;is and what&nbsp;is not to be<br>cultivated. For when one cultivating an ascetic practice finds that his meditation<br>subject improves, he should cultivate it; but when he is cultivating one and finds<br>that his meditation subject deteriorates, he should not cultivate it. But when he<br>finds that, whether he cultivates one or not, his meditation subject only improves<br>and does not deteriorate,&nbsp;he should cultivate them out of compassion for later<br>generations. And when he finds that, whether he cultivates them or not, his<br>meditation subject does not improve,&nbsp;he should still cultivate them for the sake of<br>acquiring the habit for the future. So they are of two kinds as what&nbsp;is and what&nbsp;is<br>not to be cultivated.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:413;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft1344">89.&nbsp;And all are of one kind as volition. For there is only one ascetic practice,<br>namely, that consisting in the volition of undertaking. Also it is said in the<br>Commentary: “It is the volition that is the ascetic practice, they say.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:470;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft1344">90.&nbsp;<i>7.&nbsp;Singly</i>: with thirteen for bhikkhus, eight for bhikkhunīs, twelve for novices,<br>seven for female probationers and female novices, and two for male and female lay<br>followers, there are thus forty-two.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:527;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft1344">91.&nbsp;If there is a charnel ground in the open that complies with the forest-dweller’s<br>practice, one bhikkhu is able to put all the ascetic practices into effect simultaneously.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:566;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft1341">But the two,&nbsp;namely, the forest-dweller’s practice and the later-food-refuser’s</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:583;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft1344">practice, are forbidden to bhikkhunīs by&nbsp;training precept. [83] And it is hard for<br>them to observe the three, namely, the open-air-dweller’s practice, the tree-root-<br>dweller’s practice, and the charnel-ground-dweller’s practice, because a bhikkhunī<br>is not allowed to live&nbsp;without a companion, and it is hard to find a female companion<br>with like desire for such a place, and even if available, she would not escape having<br>to live&nbsp;in company. This being so, the purpose of cultivating the ascetic practice<br>would scarcely be served. It is because they are reduced by&nbsp;five&nbsp;owing to this<br>inability to make use of certain of them that they are to be understood as eight<br>only for bhikkhunīs.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:744;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft1344">92.&nbsp;Except for the triple-robe-wearer’s practice all the other twelve as stated should<br>be understood to be for novices, and all the other seven for female probationers<br>and female novices.</span></nobr></DIV>
