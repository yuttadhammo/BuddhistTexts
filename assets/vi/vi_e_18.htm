<DIV style="position:absolute;top:127;left:27"><nobr><span class="ft5920">Here is a brief explanation. The states that are conditions should be</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:145;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5923">understood as the&nbsp;<i>dependent origination</i>. The states generated by&nbsp;such and such<br>conditions are&nbsp;<i>dependently-originated states</i>.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:184;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5923">5.&nbsp;How is that to be known? By the Blessed One’s word. For it is precisely those<br>states which are conditions, that with the synonyms beginning with “reality”<br>have&nbsp;been called “dependent origination” by&nbsp;the Blessed One when teaching<br>the dependent origination in the sutta on the Teaching of the Dependent<br>Origination and Dependently-originated States thus:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:276;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft5920">“And what&nbsp;is dependent origination, bhikkhus?</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:297;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft5920">“With birth as condition, bhikkhus, there is ageing and death. Whether Perfect</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:315;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5923">Ones arise or do not arise, there yet remains that element, relatedness of states,<br>regularity of states, specific conditionally. The Perfect One discovers it, penetrates<br>to it. Having discovered it, penetrated to it, he announces it, teaches it, makes it<br>known, establishes, exposes, expounds, and explains it: ‘See,’ he says, ‘With<br>birth as condition there is ageing and death.’</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:406;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft5920">“With becoming as condition, bhikkhus, there is birth … With ignorance as</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:424;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5923">condition, bhikkhus, there are formations. Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not<br>arise, there yet remains that element, relatedness of states, regularity of states,<br>specific conditionally. The Perfect One discovers it, penetrates to it. Having<br>discovered it, penetrated to it, he announces it, teaches it, makes it known,<br>establishes, exposes, expounds and explains it: ‘See,’ he says, ‘With ignorance<br>as condition there are formations.’</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:533;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft5920">“So, bhikkhus, that herein which is reality, not unreality, not otherness, specific</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:550;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5920">conditionality: that is called dependent origination” (S II 25f.).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:572;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft5920">Consequently, it should be understood that dependent origination has the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:589;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5923">characteristic of being the conditions for the states beginning with ageing-and-<br>death. Its function is to continue [the process of] suffering. It is manifested as the<br>wrong path.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:646;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5920">6.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:646;left:27"><nobr><span class="ft5920">Because particular states are produced by&nbsp;particular conditions, neither</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:663;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5924">less nor more, it is called&nbsp;<i>reality</i>&nbsp;(suchness). Because once the conditions have<br>met in combination there is no non-producing, even for an instant, of the states<br>they generate,&nbsp;it is called not&nbsp;<i>unreality</i>&nbsp;(not unsuchness). Because there is no<br>arising of one state with another state’s conditions, it is called&nbsp;<i>not otherness</i>.<br>Because there is a condition, or because there is a total of conditions, for these<br>states beginning with ageing-and-death as already stated, it is called&nbsp;<i>specific<br>conditionality</i>.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:36"><nobr><span class="ft5930">The characteristic must be sought from grammar. Some, in fact, [say that</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:105;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft5933">the expression&nbsp;<i>paṭicca samuppāda</i>&nbsp;(dependent origination) is characterized<br>thus:] “having depended (<i>paṭicca</i>), a right (<i>sammā</i>) arising (<i>uppāda</i>),<br>[depending on causes rightly by] disregarding such causes conjectured by<br>sectarians as the Primordial Essence (<i>Prakºti</i>), World Soul (<i>Puruåa</i>), and so<br>on.” So what&nbsp;they call dependent origination (<i>paṭicca samuppāda</i>) is a simple<br>arising (<i>uppāda</i>) [for they equate the prefix&nbsp;<i>saṃ</i>&nbsp;only with&nbsp;<i>sammā</i>&nbsp;(rightly) and<br>ignore&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>saṃ</i>&nbsp;(with, con-)]. That is untenable. [519] Why? (1) There is no such<br>sutta; (2) it contradicts suttas; (3) it admits of no profound treatment; and (4)<br>it is ungrammatical.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:267;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft5930">9.&nbsp;(1) No sutta describes the dependent origination as simple arising.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:288;left:28"><nobr><span class="ft5930">(2) Anyone who asserts that dependent origination is of that kind involves</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:306;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft5933">himself in conflict with the Padesavihāra Sutta. How? The Newly Enlightened<br>One’s abiding (<i>vihāra</i>) is the bringing of the dependent origination to mind,<br>because, of these words of the Blessed One’s: “Then in the first watch of the night<br>the Blessed One brought to mind the dependent origination in direct and reverse<br>order” [as origination and cessation] (Vin I 1; Ud 2). Now,&nbsp;“<i>padesavihāra</i>” is the<br>abiding (<i>vihāra</i>) in one part (<i>desa</i>) of that, according as it is said, “Bhikkhus, I<br>abode in a part of the abiding in which I abode when I was newly enlightened”<br>(S V 12; Paṭis I 107). And there he abode in the vision of structure of conditions,<br>not in the vision of simple arising, according as it is said, “So I understood<br>feeling with wrong view as its condition, and feeling with right view as its<br>condition, and feeling with wrong thinking as its condition …” (S V 12), all of<br>which should be quoted in full. So anyone who asserts that dependent origination<br>is simple arising involves himself in conflict with the Padesavihāra Sutta.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:537;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft5930">10.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:537;left:43"><nobr><span class="ft5930">There is likewise contradiction of the Kaccāna Sutta. For in the Kaccāna</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:554;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft5933">Sutta it is said, “When a man sees correctly with right understanding the<br>origination of the world, Kaccāna, he does not say of the world that it is not” (S<br>II 17). And there it is the dependent origination in forward order, not simple<br>arising, that, as the origination of the world from its conditions, is set forth in<br>order to eliminate the annihilation view.&nbsp;For the annihilation view is not<br>eliminated by&nbsp;seeing simple arising; but it is eliminated by&nbsp;seeing the chain of<br>conditions as a chain of fruits following on a chain of conditions. So anyone<br>who asserts that the dependent origination is simple arising involves himself in<br>contradiction of the Kaccāna Sutta.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:715;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft5933">11.&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;<i>It admits of no profound treatment</i>: this has been said by&nbsp;the Blessed One,<br>“This dependent origination is profound, Ánanda, and profound it appears”<br>(D II 55; S II 92). And the profundity is fourfold as we&nbsp;shall explain below<br>(XVII.304f.); but there is none of that in simple arising. And this dependent<br>origination is explained [by the teachers] as adorned with the fourfold method<br>(XVII.309); but there is no [need of] any such tetrad of methods in simple arising.<br>So dependent origination is not simple arising, since that admits of no profound<br>treatment.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:859;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft5933">12.&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;<i>It is ungrammatical</i>: [520] this word&nbsp;<i>paṭicca</i>&nbsp;(lit. “having depended”; freely<br>“due to,” “dependent”), [being a gerund of the verb&nbsp;<i>paṭi</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>eti</i>, to go back to],</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5943">establishes a meaning [in a formula of establishment by&nbsp;verb] when it is construed<br>as past with the same subject [as that of the principal verb], as in the sentence<br>“Having depended on (<i>paṭicca</i>&nbsp;= ‘due to’) the eye and visible objects, eye-<br>consciousness arises (<i>uppajjati</i>)” (S II 72). But if it is construed here with the<br>word&nbsp;<i>uppāda</i>&nbsp;(arising), [which is a noun], in a formula of establishment by&nbsp;noun,<br>there is a breach of grammar, because there is no shared subject [as there is in<br>above-quoted sentence], and so it does not establish any meaning al all. So the<br>dependent origination is not simple arising because that is ungrammatical.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5940">13.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:34"><nobr><span class="ft5940">Here it might be [argued]: “We shall add the words ‘comes to be’ (<i>hoti</i>)</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5943">thus: ‘Having depended, arising comes to be’ (<i>paṭicca, samuppādo</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>hoti</i>).” That will<br>not do. Why not? Because there is no instance in which it has been added, and<br>because the fallacy of the arising of an arising follows. For in such passages as<br>“<i>Paṭiccasamuppādaṃ vo bhikkhave desessāmi. Katamo ca bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo<br></i>…&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo</i>&nbsp;(I shall teach you the dependent<br>origination, bhikkhus. And what&nbsp;is the dependent origination? … This is called<br>the dependent origination, bhikkhus)” (S II 1), the words “comes to be” (<i>hoti</i>) are<br>not added in any single instance. And there is no [such expression as] “arising<br>comes to be”: if there were, it would be tantamount to saying that arising itself<br>had an arising too.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:428;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5940">14.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:428;left:33"><nobr><span class="ft5940">And those are wrong who imagine that specific conditionality (<i>idappaccayatā</i>)</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:445;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5943">is the specific conditions’ [abstract] essence—what is called “abstract essence”<br>being a [particular] mode in ignorance, etc., that acts as cause in the manifestation<br>of formations, etc.—and that the term “dependent origination” is used for an<br>alteration in formations when there is that [particular mode in the way of<br>occurrence of ignorance]. Why are they wrong? Because it is ignorance, etc.,<br>themselves that are called causes.&nbsp;For in the following passage it is ignorance,<br>etc., themselves, not their alteration, that are called the causes [of these states]:<br>“Therefore, Ánanda, just this is the cause, this is the source, this is the origin,<br>this is the condition, for ageing-and-death, that is to say,&nbsp;birth … for formations,<br>that is to say,&nbsp;(ignorance)” (D II 57–63—the last clause is not in the Dīgha text).<br>Therefore it is the actual states themselves as conditions that should be<br>understood as “dependent origination.” So what&nbsp;was said above&nbsp;(§4) can be<br>understood as rightly said.</span></nobr></DIV>

Consequently: it is to be arrived<br>at&nbsp;(<i>paṭicco</i>) and it is a co-arising (<i>samuppādo</i>), thus it is dependent origination<br>(<i>paṭicca-samuppāda</i>). Again: it arises as a togetherness (<i>saha</i>), thus it is a co-<br>arising (<i>samuppāda</i>); but it does so having depended (<i>paṭicca—</i>ger.) in<br>combination with conditions, not regardless of them. Consequently: it, having<br>depended (<i>paṭicca</i>), is a co-arising (<i>samuppāda</i>), thus in this way also it is<br>dependent origination (<i>paṭicca-samuppāda</i>). And the total of causes is a condition<br>for that [total of states produced from the conditionality], so, because it is a<br>condition for that, this [total of causes] is called, “dependent origination,” using<br>for it the term ordinarily used for its fruit just as in the world molasses, which is<br>a condition for phlegm, is spoken of thus, “Molasses is phlegm,” or just as in<br>the Dispensation the arising of Buddhas, which is a condition for bliss, is spoken<br>of thus, “The arising of Buddhas is bliss” (Dhp 194).</span></nobr></DIV>

And it is called a “co-arising” (<i>samuppādo</i>) since it<br>causes the states that occur in unresolved mutual interdependence to arise<br>associatedly. Consequently: it is dependent (<i>paṭicco</i>) and a co-arising (<i>samuppādo</i>),<br>thus in this way also it is dependent origination (<i>paṭicca-samuppāda</i>).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:563;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft5966">24.&nbsp;<i>The two together</i>: since any given states are produced without interrupting<br>the [cause-fruit] continuity of any given combination of conditions, the whole<br>expression “dependent origination” (<i>paṭicca-samuppāda</i>) represents the middle<br>way,&nbsp;which rejects the doctrines, “He who acts is he who reaps” and “One acts<br>while another reaps” (S II 20), and which is the proper way described thus, “Not<br>insisting on local language and not overriding normal usage” (M III 234).4</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:189;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft5976">25.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;in teaching this dependent origination the Blessed One has set forth<br>the text in the way beginning, “With ignorance as condition there are<br>formations” (S II 20). Its meaning should be commented on by&nbsp;one who keeps<br>within the circle of the Vibhajjavādins,5&nbsp;who does not misrepresent the teachers,<br>who does not advertise his own standpoint, who does not quarrel with the<br>standpoint of others, who does not distort suttas, who is in agreement with the<br>Vinaya, who looks to the principal authorities (<i>mahāpadesa—</i>D II 123ff.), who<br>illustrates the law (<i>dhamma</i>), who takes up the meaning (<i>attha</i>), repeatedly<br>reverting to that same meaning, describing it in various different ways.6&nbsp;And it<br>is inherently difficult to comment on the dependent origination, as the Ancients<br>said:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:407;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft5977">&nbsp;mentality-materiality come,’ use the current forms ‘woman’ and ‘man.’ This is how,&nbsp;in<br>those who have&nbsp;not fully understood what&nbsp;a physical basis is, there comes to be the<br>insistence (misinterpretation), ‘This is really a woman, this is really a man.’ But since<br>this is a mere concept, which depends on states made to occur in such and such wise,<br>one who sees and knows the dependent origination does not insist on (misinterpret)<br>it as the ultimate meaning. ‘<i>Current speech</i>’<i>&nbsp;</i>is speech current in the world. ‘<i>Not overriding</i>’<br>is not going beyond. For when ‘a being’ is said, instead of making an analysis like this,<br>‘What is the [lasting] being here? Is it materiality? Or feeling?’ and so on, one who<br>does not override current usage should express a worldly meaning in ordinary language<br>as those in the world do, employing the usage current in the world” (Vism-mhṭ 557–<br>58)<i>.&nbsp;</i>The explanation differs somewhat&nbsp;from MN 139.<br>5.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:585;left:34"><nobr><span class="ft5974">The term “analyzer” (<i>vibhajjavādin</i>) appears at&nbsp;A V 190, and at&nbsp;M II 197, in this</span></nobr></DIV>

The “meaning” (<i>attha</i>) is<br>the meaning of that. Or they are the cause, and the fruit of the cause here, is what&nbsp;is meant.<br>Or “law” (<i>dhamma</i>) is regularity (<i>dhammatā</i>). Now some, misinterpreting the meaning of<br>the sutta passage, ‘Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise, there yet remains that<br>element …’ (S II 25), wrongly describe the regularity of the dependent origination as a<br>‘permanent dependent origination,’ instead of which it should be described as having the<br>individual essence of a cause (<i>kāraṇa</i>), defined according to its own fruit, in the way stated.<br>And some misinterpret the meaning of the dependent origination thus, ‘Without cessation,<br>without arising’ (<i>anuppādaṃ anirodhaṃ</i>) instead of taking the unequivocal meaning in the<br>way stated” (Vism-mhṭ 561). The last-mentioned quotation “Without cessation, without<br>arising” (<i>anuppādaṃ anirodhaṃ</i>), seems almost certainly to refer to a well-known stanza in<br>Nāgārjuna’s&nbsp;<i>Mūlamādhyamika Kārikā</i>:</span></nobr></DIV>

From what&nbsp;are they born? By what&nbsp;are they produced?<br>These four nutriments have&nbsp;craving as their source, craving as their origin, they<br>are born from craving, produced by&nbsp;craving.

(iii) And it<br>should be recognized that when he surveys the world as fallen upon trouble in<br>the way stated thus, “This world has fallen upon trouble; it is born, ages, dies,<br>passes away, and reappears” (S II 10), he employs his teaching of it backwards<br>starting from the end in order to show the [laws governing the] various kinds of<br>suffering beginning with ageing and death, which he discovered himself in the<br>early stage of his penetration.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:127;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft6013">41.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;as regards these two states that are starting points in expositions of<br>the process [of becoming], in some instances the Blessed One teaches the<br>Dhamma based on a single one of these states, for instance, [526] “Accordingly,<br>bhikkhus, formations have&nbsp;ignorance as their cause, consciousness has<br>formations as its cause” (S II 31), etc.; likewise, “Bhikkhus, craving increases in<br>one who dwells seeing enjoyment in things productive&nbsp;of clinging; with craving<br>as condition there is clinging” (S II 84), and so on. In some instances he does so<br>based on both, for instance: “So, bhikkhus, for the fool who is hindered by<br>ignorance and tethered by&nbsp;craving there arises this body. Now,&nbsp;this body [with<br>its six internal bases] and externally [the six bases due to] mentality-materiality<br>make a duality. Due to this duality there is contact, as well as the six [pairs of]<br>bases, touched through which the fool feels pleasure and pain” (S II 23f.), and so on.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:341;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft6013">42.&nbsp;Of these ways of presentation, that cited here in the form “With ignorance<br>as condition there are formations” should be understood as one based on a<br>single state. This, firstly, is how the exposition should be known “as to different<br>ways of teaching.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:415;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft6013">43.&nbsp;<i>2.&nbsp;</i>As to meaning: as to the meaning of the words “ignorance” and so on.<br>Bodily misconduct, etc., for example, “ought not to be found” (<i>avindiya</i>), in the<br>sense of being unfit to be carried out; the meaning is that it should not be<br>permitted. It finds (<i>vindati</i>) what&nbsp;ought not to be found (<i>avindiya</i>), thus it is<br>ignorance (<i>avijjā</i>). Conversely, good bodily conduct, etc. “ought to be found”<br>(<i>vindiya</i>). It does not find (<i>na vindati</i>) what&nbsp;ought to be found (<i>vindiya</i>), thus it is<br>ignorance (<i>avijjā</i>). Also it prevents knowing (<i>avidita</i>) the meaning of collection<br>in the aggregates, the meaning of actuating in the bases, the meaning of voidness<br>in the elements, the meaning of predominance in the faculties, the meaning of<br>reality in the truths, thus it is ignorance (<i>avijjā</i>). Also it prevents knowing the<br>meaning of suffering, etc., described in four ways as “oppression,” etc. (XVI.15),<br>thus it is ignorance. Through all the kinds of generations, destinies, becoming,<br>stations of consciousness, and abodes of beings in the endless round of rebirths<br>it drives beings on (<i>AntaVIrahite saṃsāre</i>&nbsp;…&nbsp;<i>satte JAvāpeti</i>), thus it is ignorance<br>(<i>avijjā</i>). Amongst women, men, etc., which are in the ultimate sense non-existent,<br>it hurries on (<i>paramatthato AVIJjamānesu itthi-purisādisu JAvati</i>), and amongst the<br>aggregates, etc., which are existent, it does not hurry on (<i>vijjamānesu pi<br>khandhādisu na javati</i>), thus it is ignorance (<i>avijjā</i>). Furthermore, it is ignorance<br>because it conceals the physical bases and objects of eye-consciousness, etc.,<br>and the dependent origination and dependently-originated states.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:767;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft6013">44.&nbsp;That due to (<i>paṭicca</i>)&nbsp;which fruit comes (<i>eti</i>) is a condition (<i>paccaya</i>). “Due<br>to” (<i>paṭicca</i>) = “not without that”; the meaning is, not dispensing with it.<br>“Comes” (<i>eti</i>) means both “arises” and “occurs.” Furthermore, the meaning of<br>“condition” is the meaning of “help.” It is ignorance and that is a condition,<br>thus it is “ignorance as condition,” whence the phrase “with ignorance as<br>condition.”</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:176;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6060">60.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:176;left:34"><nobr><span class="ft6062"><i>Formations</i>&nbsp;are the six mentioned in brief above&nbsp;thus, “the three, namely,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:193;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6063">formations of merit, etc., and the three, namely, the bodily formation, etc.” (§44);<br>but in detail here the [first] three formations are twenty-nine volitions, that is to<br>say,&nbsp;the formation of merit consisting of thirteen volitions, counting the eight<br>sense-sphere profitable volitions that occur in giving, in virtue, etc., and the five<br>fine-material profitable volitions that occur in development [of meditation]; then<br>the formation of demerit consisting of the twelve unprofitable volitions that occur<br>in killing living things, etc.; then the formation of the imperturbable consisting<br>in the four profitable volitions associated with the immaterial sphere, which<br>occur in development [of those meditations].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:354;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6063">61.&nbsp;As regards the other three, the bodily formation is bodily volition, the verbal<br>formation is verbal volition, and the mental formation is mental volition. This<br>triad is mentioned in order to show that at&nbsp;the moment of the accumulation of the<br>kamma the formations of merit, etc., occur in these [three] kamma doors. For the<br>eight sense-sphere profitable and twelve unprofitable volitions, making twenty,<br>are the bodily formation when they occur in the body door and produce bodily<br>intimation. Those same volitions [531] are called the verbal formation when they<br>occur in the speech door and produce verbal intimation. But volition connected<br>with direct-knowledge is not included here in these two cases because it is not a<br>condition for [resultant rebirth-linking] consciousness later. And like direct-<br>knowledge volition, so also volition connected with agitation is not included;<br>therefore that too should not be included as a condition for [rebirth-linking]<br>consciousness. However,&nbsp;all these have&nbsp;ignorance as their condition. And all the<br>twenty-nine volitions are the mental formation when they arise in the mind door<br>without originating either kind of intimation. So this triad comes within the first<br>triad, and accordingly, as far as the meaning is concerned, ignorance can be<br>understood as condition simply for formations of merit and so on.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:654;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6063">62.&nbsp;Herein, it might be [asked]: How can it be known that these formations have<br>ignorance as their condition?—By the fact that they exist when ignorance exists.<br>For when unknowing—in other words, ignorance—of suffering, etc., is<br>unabandoned in a man, owing firstly to his unknowing about suffering and<br>about the past, etc., then he believes the suffering of the round of rebirths to be<br>pleasant and he embarks upon the three kinds of formations which are the<br>cause of that very suffering. Owing to his unknowing about suffering’s origin<br>he embarks upon formations that, being subordinated to craving, are actually<br>the cause of suffering, imagining them to be the cause of pleasure. And owing to<br>his unknowing about cessation and the path, he misperceives the cessation of<br>suffering to be in some particular destiny [such as the Brahmā-world] that is not<br>in fact cessation; he misperceives the path to cessation, believing it to consist in<br>sacrifices, mortification for immortality, etc., which are not in fact the path to<br>cessation; and so while aspiring to the cessation of suffering, he embarks upon</span></nobr></DIV>

Also, not seeing the danger in the indulgence of<br>sense desires, etc., with its results, [wrongly] perceiving pleasure and overcome<br>by&nbsp;defilements, he embarks upon the formation of demerit that occurs in the<br>three doors [of kamma], like a child who plays with filth, and like a man who<br>wants to die and eats poison.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:201;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft6080">Herein, “cause” (<i>hetu</i>) is a term for a part of a syllogism, for a reason, and for</span></nobr></DIV>

For with the words “proposition” (<i>paṭiññā</i>), “cause” (<i>hetu</i>&nbsp;= middle term),<br>etc., in the world it is a member of a syllogism (<i>vacanāvayava</i>) that is called a<br>cause. But in the Dispensation, in such passages as “Those states that are<br>produced from a cause” (Vin I 40), it is a reason (<i>kāraṇa</i>); and in such passages<br>as “Three profitable [root-] causes, three unprofitable [root-]causes” (Dhs §1053),<br>it is a root (<i>mūla</i>) that is called a cause.

But as to characteristic, a condition<br>has the characteristic of assisting; for any given state [533] that assists the<br>presence or arising of a given state is called the latter’s condition. The words<br>condition, cause, reason, source, originator, producer, etc., are one in meaning<br>though different in the letter. So, since it is a cause in the sense of a root, and a<br>condition in the sense of assistance, briefly a state that is assistantial in the<br>sense of a root is a [root-]cause condition.</span></nobr></DIV>

Nevertheless, it is a condition for them, for this is said: “Root-causes are a<br>condition, as root-cause condition, for the states associated with a root-cause<br>and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby” (Paṭṭh I 1). Again, the<br>indeterminateness of root-causeless consciousness is established without it.<br>And the profitableness, etc., of those with root-cause is bound up with wise<br>attention, etc., not with the associated root-causes. And if the profitableness, etc.,<br>resided in the associated root-causes as an individual essence, then either the<br>non-greed bound up with the root-cause in the associated states would be only<br>profitable or it would be only indeterminate; but since it can be both,<br>profitableness, etc., in the root-causes must still be sought for,&nbsp;just as in the<br>associated states [such as wise attention, and so on].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:807;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6085">70.&nbsp;But when the root-causes’ sense of root is taken as establishing stableness,<br>rather than as establishing profitableness, etc., there is no contradiction.

Now,&nbsp;there are no states that are not object conditions; for the<br>passage beginning “The visible-data base [is a condition, as object condition,]<br>for the eye-consciousness element” concludes thus: “When any states, as states<br>of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants, arise contingent upon any<br>states, these [latter] states are conditions, as object condition, for those [former]<br>states” (Paṭṭh I 1).11&nbsp;For just as a weak man both gets up and stands by&nbsp;hanging<br>on to (<i>ālambitvā</i>) a stick or rope, so states of consciousness and consciousness-<br>concomitants always arise and are present contingent upon visible data, etc., as<br>their object (<i>ārammaṇa&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>=&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>ālambana</i>).

So with the rest. But the state, by&nbsp;giving importance to which,<br>immaterial states occur, is their&nbsp;<i>object-predominance</i>. Hence it is said: “When any<br>states, as states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants, arise by&nbsp;giving<br>importance to any states, these [latter] states are a condition, as predominance<br>condition, for those [former] states” (Paṭṭh I 2).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6106">proximity of aim (fruit) and contiguity condition refers to proximity of time.

[535] But since there is no<br>proximity of time, the state of contiguity condition is therefore impossible<br>[according to them] since their belief is that the contiguity condition depends on<br>proximity of time (cf. M-a II 363). Instead of adopting any such misinterpretation,<br>the difference should be treated as residing in the letter only, not in the meaning.<br>How? There is no interval (<i>antara</i>) between them, thus they are proximate<br>(<i>anantara</i>); they are quite without interval because [even the distinction of] co-<br>presence is lacking, thus they are contiguous (<i>samanantara</i>).14</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:162;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6120">82.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6123">differentiating it from the proximity condition in the way beginning, “Any<br>preceding profitable aggregates are a condition, as decisive-support condition,<br>for any succeeding aggregates” (Paṭṭh I 165). But in the exposition there is a<br>distinction, because in the exposition of the schedule (<i>mātikā-nikkhepa</i>) they are<br>given as proximity in the way beginning, “Eye-consciousness element and the<br>states associated therewith are a condition, as proximity condition, for mind<br>element and for the states associated therewith” (Paṭṭh I 2) and as decisive-<br>support in the way beginning, “Any preceding profitable states are a condition<br>as decisive-support condition, for any succeeding profitable states” (Paṭṭh I 4),<br>though it comes to the same thing as regards the meaning. Nevertheless,<br><i>proximity</i>&nbsp;may be understood as the ability to cause the occurrence of an<br>appropriate conscious arising proximate (next) to itself, and&nbsp;<i>decisive support</i>&nbsp;as<br>the preceding consciousness’s cogency in the arousing of the succeeding<br>consciousnesses.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:428;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6120">83.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:428;left:36"><nobr><span class="ft6120">For while in the cases of root-cause and other such conditions</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:445;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6123">consciousness can arise actually without any of those conditions, there is no<br>arising of consciousness without a proximate consciousness [to precede it], so<br>this is a cogent condition. Their difference, then, may be understood in this way:<br><i>proximity condition</i>&nbsp;arouses an appropriate consciousness proximate (next) to<br>itself, while&nbsp;<i>proximity-decisive-support condition</i>&nbsp;is a cogent reason.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:537;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6123">84.&nbsp;(c) As to&nbsp;<i>natural-decisive-support</i>: the decisive-support is natural, thus it is a<br>natural-decisive-support. Faith, virtue, etc., produced in, or climate, food, etc.,<br>habitual to, one’s own continuity are called natural. Or else, it is a decisive-<br>support by&nbsp;nature, [537] thus it is a natural-decisive-support. The meaning is<br>that it is unmixed with object and proximity. It should be understood as variously<br>divided up in the way beginning: “Natural-decisive-support: with faith as<br>decisive-support a man gives a gift, undertakes the precepts of virtue, does the<br>duties of the Uposatha, arouses jhāna, arouses insight, arouses the path, arouses<br>direct-knowledge, arouses an attainment. With virtue … With learning … With<br>generosity … With understanding as decisive-support a man gives a gift …<br>arouses an attainment. Faith, virtue, learning, generosity, understanding, are<br>conditions, as decisive-support condition, for [the repeated arising of] faith,<br>virtue, learning, generosity, understanding” (Paṭṭh I 165). So these things<br>beginning with faith are natural-decisive-support since they are both natural<br>and decisive-supports in the sense of a cogent reason.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6186">condition there are formations,” is incorrect—It is not incorrect. Why not? Here<br>is the reason:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:127;left:109"><nobr><span class="ft6186">Nor from a single cause arise<br>One fruit or many, nor one fruit from many;<br>’Tis helpful, though, to utilize<br>One cause and fruit as representative.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:201;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6180">106.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:201;left:41"><nobr><span class="ft6180">Here there is no single or multiple fruit of any kind from a single cause,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:219;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6186">nor a single fruit from multiple causes, but only multiple fruit from multiple<br>causes. So from multiple causes, in other words, from temperature, earth, seed,<br>and moisture, is seen to arise a multiple fruit, in other words, the shoot, which<br>has visible form, odour, taste, and so on. But one representative&nbsp;cause and fruit<br>given in this way,&nbsp;“With ignorance as condition there are formations; with<br>formations as condition, consciousness,” have&nbsp;a meaning and a use.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:328;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6180">107.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:328;left:41"><nobr><span class="ft6180">For the Blessed One employs one representative&nbsp;cause and fruit when it is</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:345;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6186">suitable for the sake of elegance in instruction and to suit the idiosyncrasies of<br>those susceptible of being taught. And he does so in some instances because it<br>is a basic factor, and in some instances because it is the most obvious, and in<br>some instances because it is not common to all.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:419;left:19"><nobr><span class="ft6180">In the passage “With contact as condition, feeling” (M I 261) he mentions a</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:437;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6186">single cause and fruit because they are basic factors. For contact is the basic<br>cause of feeling since the kinds of feeling are defined according to the kinds of<br>contact [as “eye-contact-born feeling” and so on], and feeling is contact’s basic<br>fruit since contact is defined according to the kinds of feeling [that it produces].<br>He mentions a single cause in the passage “Disease due to phlegm” (A V 110)<br>because that is the most obvious. For here what&nbsp;is obvious is the phlegm, not the<br>kamma, etc., [mentioned later in the same sutta]. He mentions a single cause in<br>the passage “Bhikkhus, any states whatever that are unprofitable are all rooted<br>in unwise attention” (cf. S V 91) because it is not common to all. For unwise<br>attention to unprofitable things is not common to all [states] in the way that, say,<br>physical basis and object are common to all.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:633;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6180">108.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:633;left:41"><nobr><span class="ft6180">Consequently, although other causes of formations such as physical basis</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:650;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6186">and object, conascent states, etc., are actually existent, still ignorance may be<br>understood as the representative&nbsp;cause of formations [firstly] because it is the<br>basic factor as the cause of other causes of formations such as craving, etc., as it<br>is said: “Craving increases in one who dwells seeing enjoyment” (S II 84), and<br>“With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of cankers” (M I 55); and<br>again because it is the most obvious, “Not knowing, bhikkhus, in ignorance, he<br>forms the formation of merit” (cf. S II 82); and lastly because it is not common to<br>all. [543] So the use of one representative&nbsp;cause and fruit should in each instance<br>be understood according to this explanation of it.18</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:811;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6180">109.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:811;left:41"><nobr><span class="ft6180">Here it may be said: “We admit that. But ignorance is reprehensible and</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:828;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6186">has entirely undesirable fruit. How then can it rightly be a condition for formations<br>of merit and of the imperturbable? Sugarcane does not grow&nbsp;from [bitter] nimba</span></nobr></DIV>

Herein, eye-consciousness is twofold,<br>namely, profitable [kamma-]resultant and unprofitable [kamma-]resultant (see<br>Table II for bracketed numbers that follow). Likewise ear-, nose-, tongue-, and<br>body-consciousness ((34)–(38) and (50)–(54)). But mind-consciousness is twenty-<br>two-fold, namely, the two profitable and unprofitable resultant mind elements<br>((39) and (55)), the three root-causeless mind-consciousness elements ((40), (41)<br>and (56)), the eight sense-sphere resultant consciousnesses with root-cause<br>((42)–(49)), the five&nbsp;of the fine-material sphere ((57)–(61)), and the four of the<br>immaterial sphere ((62)–(65)).

Rebirth-linking by&nbsp;means of the<br>eight principal resultant consciousnesses with root-cause ((42)–(49)) comes<br>about among deities of the sense sphere and the meritorious among men. That<br>by&nbsp;means of the five&nbsp;fine-material resultant kinds comes about in the fine-material<br>Brahmā-world. That by&nbsp;means of the four immaterial-sphere resultant kinds<br>comes about in the immaterial world.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:363;left:28"><nobr><span class="ft6250">(iv) Briefly, rebirth-linking [consciousness] has three kinds of objects, namely,</span></nobr></DIV>

Consequently, it should be understood<br>how it occurs in the happy destinies and the unhappy destinies as follows, that<br>is to say,&nbsp;how rebirth-linking consciousness with one of three kinds of objects<br>occurs next to death consciousness with one of two kinds of objects.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:598;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft6256">136.&nbsp;[<i>From happy to unhappy destiny</i>.] For example, firstly in the case of a person<br>in the happy destinies of the sense-sphere who is an evildoer, when he is lying<br>on his deathbed, his evil kamma according as it has been stored up, or its sign,<br>comes into focus in the mind door.&nbsp;For it is said, “Then [the evil deeds that he did<br>in the past] … cover him [and overspread him and envelop him]” (M III 164), and<br>so on.

So it can be<br>known, by&nbsp;means of the consciousness-born materiality that is seen, that<br>consciousness is also a condition for the unseen materiality of rebirth-linking.<br>For it is said in the Paṭṭhāna that, like the consciousness-originated, also the<br>kamma-originated has consciousness as its condition (see Paṭṭh I 172–73).</span></nobr></DIV>

Because in the<br>immaterial becoming there is only mentality as a condition, and that is a&nbsp;condition<br>only for the sixth base, [namely, the mind base,] not for any other.

So they have&nbsp;it that “sixfold base” means the internal [five] beginning<br>with the eye plus the sixth (mind) base.

That which in the case of sense desires is lust for sense<br>desires, greed for sense desires, delight in sense desires, craving for sense desires,<br>fever of sense desires, infatuation with sense desires, committal to sense desires:<br>that is called sense-desire clinging” (Dhs §1214). “Firmness of craving” is a<br>name for the subsequent craving itself, which has become firm by&nbsp;the influence<br>of previous craving, which acts as its decisive-support condition. But some have<br>said: Craving is the aspiring to an object that one has not yet reached, like a<br>thief’s stretching out his hand in the dark; clinging is the grasping of an object<br>that one has reached, like the thief’s grasping his objective. These states oppose<br>fewness of wishes and contentment and so they are the roots of the suffering<br>due to seeking and guarding (see D II 58f.). The remaining three kinds of clinging<br>are in brief simply [false] view.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:593;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6523">there are formations,” only profitable and unprofitable states are expressed as<br>the formation of merit, etc.; but in the clause “With clinging as condition,<br>becoming,” profitable and unprofitable and also functional states are expressed<br>because of the inclusion of rebirth-process becoming.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:702;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6520">258.</span></nobr></DIV>

So [573] there are two kinds of sense-desire becoming with sense-<br>desire clinging as condition, included in which are percipient becoming and<br>five-constituent becoming.

Hence it is said: “Here [in the present becoming], with the maturing of the<br>bases there is delusion, which is&nbsp;<i>ignorance</i>; there is accumulation, which is<br><i>formations</i>; there is attachment, which is&nbsp;<i>craving</i>; there is embracing, which is<br><i>clinging</i>; there is volition, which is&nbsp;<i>becoming</i>; thus these five&nbsp;things here in the<br>[present] kamma-process becoming are conditions for rebirth-linking in the<br>future” (Paṭis I 52). [581]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:540;left:1"><nobr><span class="ft6609">44.&nbsp;As regards these four paragraphs from the Paṭisambhidā (see §§292, 294, 296, and<br>297), all four end with the word ‘<i>paccayā</i>’<i>&nbsp;</i>(nom. pl. and abl. s.&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>paccaya&nbsp;</i>=<i>&nbsp;</i>condition). In the<br>first and third paragraphs (§§292 and 296) this is obviously nom. pl. and agrees with ‘<i>ime<br>pañca dhammā</i>’<i>&nbsp;</i>(these five&nbsp;things). But in the second and fourth paragraphs the context<br>suggests&nbsp;<i>vipākā&nbsp;</i>(results) instead of conditions. However,&nbsp;there is no doubt that the accepted<br>reading is&nbsp;<i>paccayā&nbsp;</i>here too; for the passage is also quoted in XIX.13, in the&nbsp;<i>Sammohavinodanī<br></i>(Paccayākāra-Vibhaṅga commentary = present context), and at&nbsp;M-a I 53. The<br><i>Paramatthamañjūsā</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mūla Þīkā</i>&nbsp;do not mention this point. The&nbsp;<i>Saddhammappakāsinī<br></i>(Paṭisambhidā commentary) comments on the first paragraph: “<i>Purimakammabhavasmin<br>ti atītajātiyā kammabhave karīyamāne pavattā; idha paṭisandhiyā paccayā ti paccuppannā paṭisandhiyā<br>paccayabhūtā,”</i>&nbsp;and on the second paragraph:<i>&nbsp;“Idh’upapattibhavasmiṃ pure katassa kammassa<br>paccayā ti paccuppanne vipākabhave atītajātiyaṃ katassa kammassa paccayena pavattī ti attho</i>.”<br>The &nbsp;<i>Majjhima Nikāya Þīkā</i>&nbsp;(M-a I 53) says of the second paragraph: “<i>Ime paccayā ti ime<br>viññāṇādayo pañca koṭṭhāsikā dhammā, purimabhave katassa kammassa, kammavaṭṭassa, paccayā,<br>paccayabhāvato, taṃ paṭicca, idha, etarahi, upapattibhavasmiṃ upapattibhavabhāvena vā hontī ti<br>attho.</i>” From these comments it is plain enough that “<i>paccayā</i>” in the second and fourth<br>paragraphs is taken as abl. sing. (e.g.&nbsp;<i>avijjā</i>-<i>paccayā saṅkhārā).&nbsp;</i>There is a parallel ablative<br>construction with genitive&nbsp;at&nbsp;Paṭis II 72, 1.8: “<i>Gatisampattiyā ñāṇasampayutte aṭṭhannaṃ<br>hetūnaṃ paccayā uppatti hoti</i>.” Perhaps the literal rendering of the second and fourth<br>paragraphs’ final sentence might be: “Thus there are these five&nbsp;things here in the [present]<br>rebirth-process becoming with their condition [consisting] of kamma done in the past,”<br>and so on. The point is unimportant.</span></nobr></DIV>

A purely cause-and-effect chain would not represent the pattern of a situation<br>that is always complex, always subjective-objective, static-dynamic, positive-negative,<br>and so on. Again, there is no evidence of any historical development in the various<br>forms given&nbsp;<i>within the limit of the Sutta Piṭaka&nbsp;</i>(leaving aside the Paṭisambhidāmagga),<br>and historical treatment within that particular limit is likely to mislead, if it is hypothesis<br>with no foundation.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:438;left:28"><nobr><span class="ft6653">Parallels with European thought have&nbsp;been avoided in this translation. But perhaps</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:455;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft6655">an exception can be made here, with due caution, in the case of Descartes. The revolution<br>in European thought started by&nbsp;his formula&nbsp;<i>cogito ergo sum&nbsp;</i>(“I think, therefore I am”)<br>is not yet ended. Now,&nbsp;it will perhaps not escape notice that the two elements, “I think”<br>and “I am,” in what&nbsp;is not a logical proposition parallel to some extent the two members<br>of the dependent origination, consciousness and being (becoming). In other words,<br>consciousness activated by&nbsp;craving and clinging as the dynamic factory, guided and<br>blinkered by ignorance (“I think” or “consciousness with the conceit ‘I am’”),<br>conditions being (“therefore I am”) in a complex relationship with other factors relating<br>subject and object (not accounted for by Descartes). The parallel should not be pushed<br>too far. In fact it is only introduced because in Europe the dependent origination<br>seems to be very largely misunderstood with many strange interpretations placed<br>upon it, and because the&nbsp;<i>cogito&nbsp;</i>does seem to offer some sort of reasonable approach.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:649;left:28"><nobr><span class="ft6653">In this work, for convenience because of the special importance attached here to the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:665;left:10"><nobr><span class="ft6655">aspect of the death-rebirth link, the dependent origination is considered from only<br>one standpoint, namely, as applicable to a period embracing a minimum of three lives.<br>But this is not the only application. With suitable modifications it is also used in the<br>Vibhaṅga to describe the structure of the complex in each one of the 89 single type-<br>consciousnesses laid down in the&nbsp;<i>Dhammasaṅgaṇī</i>; and Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa<br>says: “This structure of conditions is present not only in (a continuity period consisting<br>of) multiple consciousnesses but also in each single consciousness as well” (Vibh-a<br>199–200). Also the Paṭisambhidāmagga gives five&nbsp;expositions, four describing<br>dependent origination in one life,&nbsp;the fifth being made to present a special inductive<br>generalization to extend what&nbsp;is observable in this life (the fact that consciousness is<br>always preceded by&nbsp;consciousness, cf. this Ch. §83f.—i.e. that it always has a past and<br>is inconceivable without one) back beyond birth, and (since craving and ignorance<br>ensure its expected continuance) on after death. There are, besides, various other,<br>differing applications indicated by&nbsp;the variant forms given in the suttas themselves.</span></nobr></DIV>
