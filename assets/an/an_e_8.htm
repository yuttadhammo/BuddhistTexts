<h3><a id=s1 href=#m1>1 (1) Loving-Kindness</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1 href=#p1>1</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p2 href=#p2>2</a></span>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p3 href=#p3>3</a></span>“Bhikkhus, when the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness has been pursued, developed, and cultivated, made a vehicle and basis, carried out, consolidated, and properly undertaken, eight benefits are to be expected. What eight?</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p4 href=#p4>4</a></span>(1) “One sleeps well; (2) one awakens happily; (3) one does not have bad dreams; (4) one is pleasing to human beings; (5) one is pleasing to spirits;<span class=note><sup id=note1615>1615</sup><q><em>Amanussā</em>. Lit. “nonhumans.” The word primarily refers to earthbound deities, yakkhas, and demons.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p5 href=#p5>5</a></span>“When, bhikkhus, the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness has been pursued, developed, and cultivated, made a vehicle and basis, carried out, consolidated, and properly undertaken, these eight benefits are to be expected.”</p>

Mp glosses <em>bhāvanāya</em> here with <em>bhāvanatthāya guṇasambhāvanāya vā</em>, “toward [meditative] development or toward esteem for virtues.” The latter meaning seems to fit the context better. Mp glosses <em>sāmaññāya</em> with <em>samaṇadhammatthāya</em>, “for the sake of the ascetic’s duty,” but I think it more likely that <em>sāmaññā</em> is an abstract noun from <em>samāna</em>, meaning “the same” or “similar.” I translate it as “accord,” which agrees well with the following word <em>ekībhāvāya</em>. PED lists <em>sāmañña<sup>1</sup></em> as meaning “conformity” and “unity.” The word occurs in this sense as the name of the fifth vagga of the Second Fifty (see p. 1237 below).

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p37 href=#p37>37</a></span>“Bhikkhus, an uninstructed worldling meets gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p38 href=#p38>38</a></span>“Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p39 href=#p39>39</a></span>“Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely. I will speak.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p40 href=#p40>40</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p41 href=#p41>41</a></span>“(1) Bhikkhus, when an uninstructed worldling meets with gain, he does not reflect thus: <em>‘</em>This gain that I have met is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.’ He does not understand it as it really is. (2) When he meets with loss … (3) … fame … (4) … disrepute … (5) … blame … (6) … praise … (7) … pleasure … (8) … pain, he does not reflect thus: <em>‘</em>This pain that I have met is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.’ He does not understand it as it really is.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p42 href=#p42>42</a></span>“Gain obsesses his mind, and loss obsesses his mind. Fame obsesses his mind, and disrepute obsesses his mind. Blame obsesses his mind, and praise obsesses his mind. Pleasure obsesses his mind, and pain obsesses his mind. He is attracted to gain and repelled by loss. He is attracted to fame and repelled by disrepute. He is attracted to praise and repelled by blame. He is attracted to pleasure and repelled by pain. Thus involved with attraction and repulsion, he is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; he is not freed from suffering, I say.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p43 href=#p43>43</a></span>“But, bhikkhus, (1) when an instructed noble disciple meets with gain, he reflects thus: <em>‘</em>This gain that I have met is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.’ He thus understands it as it really is. (2) When he meets with loss … (3) … fame … (4) … [159] disrepute … (5) … blame … (6) … praise … (7) … pleasure … (8) … pain, he reflects thus: <em>‘</em>This pain that I have met is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change.’ He thus understands it as it really is.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p44 href=#p44>44</a></span>“Gain does not obsess his mind, and loss does not obsess his mind. Fame does not obsess his mind, and disrepute does not obsess his mind.

He is not attracted to fame or repelled by disrepute. He is not attracted to praise or repelled by blame. <a id="calibre_link-6043"></a>He is not attracted to pleasure or repelled by pain.

It is good for him from time to time to review the failings of others. It is good for him from time to time to review his own achievements. It is good for him from time to time to review the achievements of others. Because he was over come and obsessed by eight bad conditions, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable. What eight?</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p49 href=#p49>49</a></span>“(1) Because he was overcome and obsessed by gain, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable. (2) Because he was overcome and obsessed by loss … (3) … by fame … (4) … by disrepute … (5) … by honor … (6) … by lack of honor … (7) … by evil desires … (8) … by bad friendship, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable. Because he was overcome and obsessed by these eight bad conditions, Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p50 href=#p50>50</a></span>“It is good for a bhikkhu to overcome gain whenever it arises. It is good for him to overcome loss whenever it arises … to overcome fame … disrepute … honor [161] … lack of honor … evil desires … bad friendship whenever it arises.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p51 href=#p51>51</a></span>“And for what reason should a bhikkhu overcome gain whenever it arises? For what reason should he overcome loss … fame … disrepute … honor … lack of honor … evil <a id="calibre_link-6070"></a>desires … bad friendship whenever it arises? Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who has not overcome arisen gain do not occur in one who has overcome it. Those taints, distressful and feverish, that might arise in one who has not overcome arisen loss … arisen fame … arisen disrepute … arisen honor … arisen lack of honor … arisen evil desires … arisen bad friendship do not occur in one who has overcome it. For this reason a bhikkhu should overcome gain whenever it arises. He should overcome loss … fame … disrepute … honor … lack of honor … evil desires … bad friendship whenever it arises.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p52 href=#p52>52</a></span>“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will overcome gain whenever it arises.

<h3><a id=s8 href=#m8>8 (8) Uttara on Failing</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p53 href=#p53>53</a></span>On one occasion the Venerable Uttara was dwelling at Mahisavatthu, in Dhavajālikā on Mount Saṅkheyya. There the Venerable Uttara addressed the bhikkhus….</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p54 href=#p54>54</a></span>“Friends, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings. It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review the failings of others. It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own achievements. It is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review the achievements of others.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p55 href=#p55>55</a></span>Now on that occasion the great [deva] king Vessavaṇa was traveling from north to south on some business. He heard the Venerable Uttara at Mahisavatthu, in Dhavajālikā on Mount Saṅkheyya, teaching the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: ‘Friends, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings … the failings of others … his own achievements … the achievements of others.’ Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, Vessavaṇa disappeared from Mount Saṅkheyya and reappeared among the Tāvatiṃsa devas.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p56 href=#p56>56</a></span>He approached Sakka, ruler of the devas, and said to him: “Respected sir, you should know that the Venerable Uttara, at Mahisavatthu, [163] in Dhavajālikā on Mount Saṅkheyya, has been teaching the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: ‘Friends, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own <a id="calibre_link-6044"></a>failings … the failings of others … his own achievements … the achievements of others.’”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p57 href=#p57>57</a></span>Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, Sakka disappeared from among the Tāvatiṃsa devas and reappeared at Mahisavatthu, in Dhavajālikā on Mount Saṅkheyya, in front of the Venerable Uttara. He approached the Venerable Uttara, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p58 href=#p58>58</a></span>“Is it true, Bhante, as is said, that you have been teaching the Dhamma to the bhikkhus thus: ‘Friends, it is good for a bhikkhu from time to time to review his own failings … the failings of others … his own achievements … the achievements of others’?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p59 href=#p59>59</a></span>“Yes, ruler of the devas.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p60 href=#p60>60</a></span>“But, Bhante, was this your own discernment, or was it the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p61 href=#p61>61</a></span>“Well then, ruler of the devas, I will give you a simile; even by means of a simile, some intelligent people understand the meaning of what has been said. Suppose not far from a village or town there was a great heap of grain, and a large crowd of people were to take away grain with carrying-poles, baskets, hip-sacks, [164] and their cupped hands. If someone were to approach that large crowd of people and ask them: ‘Where did you get this grain?’ what should they say?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p62 href=#p62>62</a></span>“Bhante, those people should say: ‘We got it from that great heap of grain.’”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p63 href=#p63>63</a></span>“So too, ruler of the devas, whatever is well spoken is all the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.

This could not be translated, “Whatever is the word of the Blessed One … is well spoken.” As stated, it expresses the idea that whatever good teachings the disciples speak, even when they themselves have originated them, can be regarded as <em>buddhavacana</em> because they are based on the Buddha’s own teachings.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p64 href=#p64>64</a></span>“It’s astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well you stated this: ‘Whatever is well spoken is all the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. I myself and others derive our good words from him.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p65 href=#p65>65</a></span>“On one occasion, Bhante Uttara, the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha, on Mount Vulture Peak, not long after Devadatta had left.

The discourse on knowing one’s own failings and achievements had already been taught to the bhikkhus, who are likely to have taught it to the other three assemblies.</q></span> Bhante, learn this exposition of the Dhamma, master this exposition of the Dhamma, and retain this exposition of the Dhamma in mind.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p68 href=#p68>68</a></span>“Bhikkhus, this is how Nanda guards the doors of the sense faculties: [167] If he needs to look to the east, he does so after he has fully considered the matter and clearly comprehends it thus: ‘When I look to the east, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection will not flow in upon me.’ If he needs to look to the west … to the north … to the south … to look up … to look down … to survey the intermediate directions, he does so after he has fully considered the matter and clearly comprehends it thus: ‘When I look to the intermediate directions, bad unwholesome states of longing and dejection will not flow in upon me.’ That is how Nanda guards the doors of the sense faculties.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p69 href=#p69>69</a></span>“This is how Nanda observes moderation in eating: Here, reflecting carefully, Nanda consumes food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the support and maintenance of this body, for avoiding harm, and for assisting the spiritual life, considering: ‘Thus I shall terminate the old feeling and not arouse a new feeling, and I shall be healthy and blameless and dwell at ease.’ That is how Nanda observes moderation in eating.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p70 href=#p70>70</a></span>“This is how Nanda is intent on wakefulness: [168] During <a id="calibre_link-5122"></a>the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, Nanda purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. In the first watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive qualities. In the middle watch of the night he lies down on the right side in the lion’s posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, after noting in his mind the idea of rising.

<h3><a id=s10 href=#m10>10 (10) Trash</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p73 href=#p73>73</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on a bank of the Gaggārā Lotus Pond. Now on that occasion bhikkhus were reproving a bhikkhu for an offense. When being reproved, that bhikkhu answered evasively, diverted the discussion to an irrelevant subject, and displayed anger, hatred, and resentment.<span class=note><sup id=note1632>1632</sup><q><em>Aññenāññaṃ paṭicarati, bahiddhā kathaṃ apanāmeti, kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaroti</em>.</q></span> Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: [169] “Bhikkhus, eject this person!

Be has <em>kiṃ vo tena paraputtena visodhitena</em>, “What do you have [to do] with that son of another who has been purified?” which makes no sense in this context. Ee includes still more variants in its footnotes. I take the required reading to be: <em>kiṃ vo paraputto viheṭheyya</em>.

To soften his mind, the Blessed One avoids directly contradicting him; instead he states that the term applies to him, but intending this in a different sense.

Thus Mp glosses <em>vineti</em>, in the brahmin’s view, with <em>vināseti</em>, “destroys.” But the Buddha affirms this in the sense that he teaches the Dhamma for the removal of lust and other defilements (<em>rāgādīnaṃ vinayāya</em>).</q></span></p>

A <em>tapassī</em> is usually an ascetic devoted to self-torment.

The Buddha plays on the word as if it meant “rid of (<em>apa</em>) the womb (<em>gabbha</em>).” It is nearly impossible to capture this pun in translation; my use of “retiring” is a clumsy attempt to bridge the two senses: “timid” and “retired” from wandering through the round of rebirths.</q></span></p>

When the Blessed One knew that Sīha’s mind was pliant, softened, rid of hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed that Dhamma teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Then, just as a clean cloth rid of dark spots would readily absorb dye, so too, while Sīha the general sat in that same seat, there arose in him the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye: ‘Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.’ Sīha the general became one who had seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, gotten rid of bewilderment, attained self-confidence, and become independent of others in the teaching of the Teacher.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p144 href=#p144>144</a></span>The Blessed One consented by silence. Having understood that the Blessed One had consented, Sīha rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. Then Sīha addressed a man: “Go, good man, find some meat ready for sale.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p145 href=#p145>145</a></span>Then, when the night had passed, Sīha the general had various kinds of excellent foods prepared in his own residence, after which he had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It is time, Bhante, the meal is ready.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p146 href=#p146>146</a></span>Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, went to Sīha’s residence along with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus, and sat down on the seat prepared for him. Now on that occasion a number of Nigaṇṭhas [went] from street to street and from square to square in Vesālī, thrashing their arms about and crying out: “Today Sīha the general has slain a plump animal to prepare a meal for the ascetic Gotama! The ascetic <a id="calibre_link-6184"></a>Gotama knowingly uses meat [obtained from an animal killed] especially for his sake, the act being done on his account.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p147 href=#p147>147</a></span>Then a man approached Sīha the general and whispered into his ear: “Sir, you should know that a number of Nigaṇṭhas [are going] from street to street and from square to square in Vesālī, thrashing their arms about and crying out: ‘Today Sīha the general has slain a plump animal to prepare a meal for the ascetic Gotama!

This charge plays right into the Buddhists’ protest that the Buddha is being slandered and their rejoinder that he would never intentionally have a living being killed for his meal. But as the Jains were strict vegetarians, we can be almost certain that they criticized the Buddha and his disciples, not for having an animal killed for their meal, but simply for consuming meat. On the Jain prohibition of meat-eating, see <a href="http://www.jainworld.com/jainbooks/guideline/28.htm">http://www.jainworld.com/jainbooks/guideline/28.htm</a>.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p149 href=#p149>149</a></span>Then, with his own hands, Sīha the general served and satisfied the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of excellent food. Then, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, Sīha sat down to one side. Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Sīha with a Dhamma talk, after which he rose from his seat and departed.</p>

The Chinese parallel at EĀ II 765c<small>24</small>–766a<small>2</small> lists nine ways a woman binds a man: by singing, dancing, her skills, her touch, her smile, weeping, an expedient means, beautifying her face and body, and her appearance and deportment.</q></span> A woman binds a man in these eight ways. Those beings are thoroughly bound who are bound by touch.”<span class=note><sup id=note1670>1670</sup><q>I read with Ce and Be <em>subaddhā yeva phassena baddhā</em>.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p211 href=#p211>211</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā’s Mansion in the Eastern Park. Now on that occasion, on the day of the uposatha, the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Then, as the night advanced, when the first watch passed, the Venerable Ānanda rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, reverently saluted the Blessed One, and said to him: “Bhante, the night has advanced; the first watch has passed; the Saṅgha of bhikkhus has been sitting for a long time.

He then saw that person sitting in the midst of the Saṅgha of bhikkhus: one who was immoral, of bad character, impure, of suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved. Having seen him, he rose from his seat, went up to that person, and said to him: “Get up, friend. The Blessed One has seen you.

That one is liberated by wisdom. That one is a body witness. That one is attained to view. That one is liberated by faith. That one is a Dhamma follower. That one is a faith follower. That one is virtuous, of good character. That one is immoral, of bad character.’ Still, when I am serving the Saṅgha, I do not recall thinking: ‘Let me give this one little, let me give that one a lot.’ Rather, I give with an equal mind.

He learned the meditation subject, took leave of the Buddha, and went to the Ceti country, where for eight months he passed the time engaged in walking meditation.

The Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for him. The Venerable Anuruddha then paid homage to him and sat down to one side, and the Blessed One said to him: “Good, good, Anuruddha! It is good that you have reflected on these thoughts of a great person, namely: <em>‘</em>This Dhamma is for one with few desires, not for one with strong desires….

<h3><a id=s51 href=#m51>51 (1) Gotamī</a><span class=note><sup id=note1727>1727</sup><q>This sutta, the canonical account of the founding of the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha, has been the subject of extensive scholarly investigations. The narrative also occurs at Vin II 253–56. Several recent studies on the sutta, from a critical perspective, are in Mohr and Tsedroen 2010. Particularly instructive in this collection is Ute Hüsken, “The Eight Garudhammas,” and Anālayo, “Women’s Renunciation in Early Buddhism: The Four Assemblies and the Foundation of the Order of Nuns,” which treats the chronological problem at pp. 86–90.</q></span></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p490 href=#p490>490</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park.<span class=note><sup id=note1728>1728</sup><q>The chronology is unclear to me. Mp says that at the time this sutta begins the Buddha was living among the Sakyans during his <em>first</em> return journey to Kapilavatthu (<em>paṭhamagamanena gantvā viharati</em>). Yet, given that Mahāpajāpatī could go forth only after the death of her husband, the Buddha’s father Suddhodana, and that it seems improbable Suddhodana died during the Buddha’s first return visit to Kapilavatthu, which took place soon after his enlightenment, this fact is hardly credible. It would also lead to an odd anachronism. The Cūḷavagga reports that Ānanda and other prominent Sakyans became monks after the Buddha’s first journey to Kapilavatthu (Vin II 182–83). Ānanda became the Buddha’s attendant twenty years after the enlightenment, when the Buddha was fifty-five, and served the Buddha in this capacity for twenty-five years, right up until the end of his master’s life (Th 1041–43). In this sutta, however, Ānanda is depicted as the Buddha’s attendant <em>before</em> the founding of the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha. Whether this event occurred shortly after the Buddha’s first return trip to Kapilavatthu, or even five or ten years later, it would still be too early for Ānanda to be serving as his attendant. Thus, unless Ānanda was not actually the Buddha’s attendant at the time, there seems to be a chronological tension between the situation depicted in the sutta and the likely period when women first obtained ordination.</q></span> Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p491 href=#p491>491</a></span>“Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”<span class=note><sup id=note1729>1729</sup><q>I summarize the sequence of events from Mp. When the Buddha returned to Kapilavatthu, he gave the going forth to Nanda and Rāhula and later resolved a conflict between the Sakyans and their neighbors, the Koliyans (the Buddha’s relatives on his mother’s side). Following this, 250 young men from each side left the home life under the Buddha. After a while, they began to pine for their wives. The Buddha brought them to the Kuṇāla Lake, where he taught them the Kuṇāla Jātaka on the wiles and deceitfulness of women. On hearing this, the five hundred young monks attained stream-entry and shortly afterward became arahants. Their wives sent them messages entreating them to return home, but they replied that they were now incapable of living the household life. The women therefore went to Mahāpajāpatī and asked her to request the Buddha, her stepson, to allow women to go forth. Mahāpajāpatī took the women under her wing, went to the Buddha, and made this request.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p492 href=#p492>492</a></span>“Enough, Gotamī! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p493 href=#p493>493</a></span>A second time … A third time Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p494 href=#p494>494</a></span>“Enough, Gotamī! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”<span class=note><sup id=note1730>1730</sup><q>Mp: “Why does he refuse her? Isn’t it the case that all Buddhas have four assemblies? This is true, but he refuses her with the thought that if women are given permission to go forth only after they have made repeated efforts, they will maintain their ordination and revere it, recollecting how difficult it was to obtain the going forth.”</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p495 href=#p495>495</a></span>Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, thinking: “The Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness,” miserable and saddened, wept with a tearful face. She then paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p496 href=#p496>496</a></span>Having stayed in Kapilavatthu as long as he wanted, the Blessed One set out on tour toward Vesālī. Wandering on tour, he eventually arrived at Vesālī, where he dwelled in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p497 href=#p497>497</a></span>Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had her hair cut off, put on ochre robes, and together with a number of Sakyan women,<span class=note><sup id=note1731>1731</sup><q>These were the five hundred Sakyan women whose husbands had gone forth and attained arahantship. In a personal communication, Pruitt writes: “There’s no indication of how much time elapsed between the Buddha’s departure and what follows here. In Thī-a 3, [the commentator] Dhammapāla says, ‘He had the young Nanda and the young Rāhula go forth and then the Teacher returned again to Rājagaha. On a later occasion, when the Teacher was living in the Kūṭāgāra Hall near Vesālī, the great King Suddhodana attained final quenching [nibbāna], having realized arahantship even while he was still [reigning] under the white parasol. The inclination to go forth arose in Mahā-Pajāpatī’ (Pruitt 1998: 6–7). This is also given at Thī-a 141 (Pruitt 1998: 181). King Suddhodana is the only layman I know of who became an arahant and remained a layman, which means he could not have lived more that seven days after becoming an arahant.”</q></span> [275] set out toward Vesālī. Eventually, she reached Vesālī and [went to] the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, with her feet swollen and her body covered with dust, miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face, she stood outside the entrance. The Venerable Ānanda saw her standing there in such a condition and said to her:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p498 href=#p498>498</a></span>“Gotamī, why are you standing outside the entrance with your feet swollen and your body covered with dust, miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p499 href=#p499>499</a></span>“I do so, Bhante Ānanda, because the Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p500 href=#p500>500</a></span>“Well then, Gotamī, you wait right here [a moment]<span class=note><sup id=note1732>1732</sup><q>Be has <em>muhuttaṃ</em>, not in Ce or Ee.</q></span> while I ask the Blessed One to grant women the going forth.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p501 href=#p501>501</a></span>Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Bhante, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī is standing outside the entrance with her feet swollen and her body covered with dust, miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face, because the Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women. Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p502 href=#p502>502</a></span>“Enough, Ānanda! Do not favor the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p503 href=#p503>503</a></span>A second time … A third time the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p505 href=#p505>505</a></span>Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: “The Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness. Let me ask the Blessed One for the going forth of women in some other way.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p506 href=#p506>506</a></span>Then the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, if a woman were to go forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, would it be possible for her to realize the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and the fruit of arahantship?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p507 href=#p507>507</a></span>“It would be, Ānanda.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p508 href=#p508>508</a></span>“If, Bhante, it would be possible for a woman to realize the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and the fruit of arahantship, [and considering that] Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had been very helpful to the Blessed One—having been his maternal aunt, wet-nurse, and foster mother who nurtured him with breast milk when his mother died—it would be good if women could obtain the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p509 href=#p509>509</a></span>“If, Ānanda, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts eight principles of respect,<span class=note><sup id=note1733>1733</sup><q><em>Aṭṭha garudhamme</em>. The term <em>garudhamma</em> is ambiguous. The word <em>garu</em> normally means “heavy, weighty, grave,” as for example in the expression <em>garukā āpatti</em>, a grave or major offense. But <em>garuṃ karoti</em>, lit., “to make weighty,” means “to respect,” and <em>garukata</em>, “respected.” Thus <em>garudhamma</em> can mean either a “heavy, grave rule” or “a rule to be respected, a principle of respect.” Mp endorses the second interpretation: “The <em>garudhammas</em> are principles that are to be treated with respect by the bhikkhunīs who accept them.” The translators of the Vinaya into Chinese also lean toward this interpretation. Thus in the corresponding passage in the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya (at T XXIII 345b<small>29</small>–c<small>33</small>) they are referred to as <img src="images/000003.jpg" class="calibre115">, “eight principles of respect.” The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya (for instance at T XXIV 350c<small>29</small>) calls them <img src="images/000060.jpg" class="calibre116">, “eight principles of honor and respect.” But the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya (at T XXII 923a<small>27</small> and elsewhere) designates them <img src="images/000067.jpg" class="calibre117">“eight principles not to be transgressed throughout life,” which corresponds to the Pāli <em>yāvajīvaṃ anatikkamanīyo</em>. And the Mahīśasaka Vinaya (at T XXII 185c<sub>19</sub>) likewise calls them <img src="images/000075.jpg" class="calibre118">, “eight principles not to be violated.”</q></span> let that itself be her full ordination.<span class=note><sup id=note1734>1734</sup><q>It is interesting to note how the subject of the discussion shifts almost imperceptibly from the going forth (<em>pabbajjā</em>) of women to their full ordination (<em>upasampadā</em>). The former refers simply to their leaving the household life, the latter to a formal act of admission into the Saṅgha.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p510 href=#p510>510</a></span>(1) “A bhikkhunī who has been ordained for a hundred years should pay homage to a bhikkhu who has been ordained that same day, should rise up for him, reverentially salute him, and behave courteously toward him. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.<span class=note><sup id=note1735>1735</sup><q>Mahāpajāpatī later asked the Buddha to permit bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs to pay homage to one another (and show other signs of respect) exclusively on the basis of seniority, without distinction of gender. The Buddha refused and issued a rule: “Bhikkhus should not pay homage to women, stand up for them, salute them reverentially, or behave respectfully toward them. One who does so commits an offense of wrong doing” (<em>na bhikkhave mātugāmassa abhivādanaṃ paccuṭṭhānaṃ añjalikammaṃ sāmīcikammaṃ kātabbaṃ; yo kareyya āpatti dukkaṭassa</em>). The incident is at Vin II 257–58.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p511 href=#p511>511</a></span>(2) “A bhikkhunī should not enter upon the rains in a place where there are no bhikkhus.<span class=note><sup id=note1736>1736</sup><q>This refers to the three months’ fixed residence during the rainy season.</q></span> This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p512 href=#p512>512</a></span>(3) “Every half-month a bhikkhunī should ask the Saṅgha of bhikkhus about two things: about [the day] of the uposatha, and about coming for the exhortation.<span class=note><sup id=note1737>1737</sup><q>Thus on the uposatha day a bhikkhu is assigned the task of giving the bhikkhunīs an exhortation (<em>ovāda</em>). See Ṭhānissaro 2007b: 446–47.</q></span> [277] This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.</p>

Each bhikkhu extends the invitation to all the other bhikkhus. By this rule, however, bhikkhunīs are obliged to invite correction from both the bhikkhus and the other bhikkhunīs. See Ṭhānissaro 2007b: 447–48.</q></span> This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p514 href=#p514>514</a></span>(5) “A bhikkhunī who has committed a grave offense should observe a half-month’s penalty period before both Saṅghas.<span class=note><sup id=note1739>1739</sup><q>The penalty period (<em>mānatta</em>) is imposed on a monastic guilty of a <em>saṅghādisesa</em> offense. During this period, the offending bhikkhu must undergo penalization for a period of six days; each day he must also inform all his fellow bhikkhus of his transgression, a humiliating experience. In the case of bhikkhunīs, however, the penalty period lasts two weeks and must be observed in relation to both bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs. For details, see Ṭhānissaro 2007b: 358–73. In this rule, the word <em>garudhamma</em> has a different meaning from its use in relation to the eight principles as a set. Here, Mp glosses it as <em>garukaṃ saṅghādisesāpattiṃ</em>, that is, it is the breach of a <em>saṅghādisesa</em> rule. Hüskin (in Mohr and Tsedroen 2010, p. 144) conflates the two senses of the term and thus sees an inconsistency here where there is really none.</q></span> This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.</p>

To complete the requirements for ordination, she is obliged to live for two years observing a special training in regard to six rules (<em>cha dhammā</em>). The six rules—specified at Vin IV 319,<small>24–29</small> in connection with Bhikkhunī Pācittiya 63—involve observing <em>without transgression</em> the precepts of abstinence from killing any living being, taking what is not given, sexual activity, false speech, intoxicants, and eating at an improper time (between midday and the following daybreak). Breach of any of these rules presumably requires the candidate to revert to the beginning of her two years’ training.</q></span> This principle, too, should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and should not be transgressed as long as life lasts.</p>

Several of these rules are already included among the <em>garudhammas</em>. Thus <em>garudhammas</em> 2, 3, 4, and 7 correspond to Bhikkhunī Pācittiyas 56, 59, 57, and 52. <em>Garudhamma</em> 6 has counterparts in Bhikkhunī Pācittiyas 63 and 64. The fact that the background stories to these rules show them originating at different points in the early history of the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha casts doubt on the historicity of the present account, which shows the eight <em>garudhammas</em> being laid down at the very beginning of the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha. If the eight <em>garudhammas</em> had been laid down at the birth of the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha, they would have already been in force and there would have been no need for the Buddha to issue rules to prohibit the same undesirable behavior. He could simply have pointed to the existing rule. The fact that he did issue new rules thus collides with the thesis that the eight <em>garudhammas</em> were laid down at the very start of the Bhikkhunī Saṅgha.</q></span></p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p521 href=#p521>521</a></span>(1) “A bhikkhunī who has been ordained for a hundred years should pay homage to a bhikkhu who has been ordained that same day, should rise up for him, reverentially salute him, and behave properly toward him.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p526 href=#p526>526</a></span>“If, Ānanda, women had not obtained the going forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, the spiritual life would have been of long duration; the good Dhamma would have stood firm <a id="calibre_link-5151"></a>even for a thousand years. However, Ānanda, because women have gone forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, now the spiritual life will not be of long duration; the good Dhamma will last only five hundred years.<span class=note><sup id=note1743>1743</sup><q>Assuming the historical authenticity of this passage, if the Buddha had wished to proscribe the ordination of women, it seems he would likely have pointed out this danger to Ānanda at the beginning of their conversation. Ānanda would then have desisted from his effort and women would not have received the right to ordain.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p527 href=#p527>527</a></span>“Just as, Ānanda, prowling burglars<span class=note><sup id=note1744>1744</sup><q><em>Corehi kumbhatthenakehi</em>.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p528 href=#p528>528</a></span>“Just as, Ānanda, when a field of hill rice has ripened, [279] if the bleaching disease attacks it,<span class=note><sup id=note1745>1745</sup><q><em>Setaṭṭhikā rogajāti nipatati</em>. Mp: “A kind of insect pierces the stalk and enters the middle of the reed.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p529 href=#p529>529</a></span>“Just as, Ānanda, when a field of sugar cane has ripened, if the rusting disease attacks it,<span class=note><sup id=note1746>1746</sup><q><em>Mañjiṭṭhikā rogajāti nipatati</em>.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p530 href=#p530>530</a></span>“Just as, Ānanda, a man might build a dyke around a large reservoir as a precaution so that the water would not overflow, so too, as a precaution I have prescribed for bhikkhunīs the eight principles of respect as things not to be transgressed as long as life lasts.”<span class=note><sup id=note1747>1747</sup><q>Mp (Ce): “By this he shows the following: ‘When a causeway is not built around a large reservoir, whatever water would have remained there if the causeway had first been built does not remain because there is no causeway. So too, these principles of respect have been prescribed in advance, before an incident has arisen, for the purpose of preventing transgression. If they had not been prescribed, then, because women have gone forth, the good Dhamma would have lasted five hundred years. But because they have been laid down in advance, it will continue another five hundred years and thus last for the thousand years originally stated.’ And this expression ‘a thousand years’ is said with reference to arahants who have attained the analytic knowledges (<em>paṭisambhidāpabhedappattakhīṇāsavānaṃ vasen’eva vuttaṃ</em>). Following this, for another thousand years, there appear dry-insight arahants; for another thousand years, non-returners; for another thousand years, once-returners; and for another thousand years, stream-enterers. Thus the good Dhamma of penetration (<em>paṭivedhasaddhammo</em>) will last five thousand years. The Dhamma of learning (<em>pariyattidhammo</em>) will also last this long. For without learning, there is no penetration, and as long as there is learning, there is penetration.” From the above, we can see that according to the commentary, the allowance for women to go forth will not shorten the life span of the Dhamma; this is because the Buddha laid down the eight principles of respect, which serve as the dyke or causeway.</q></span></p>

Another anachronism appears here, at least in relation to the commentarial chronology. The Bhikkhunī Saṅgha, on this chronology, was founded soon after the Buddha’s first visit to Kapilavatthu (or, on other chronologies, perhaps five or ten years after the enlightenment), yet it requires the bhikkhu who is to give the exhortation to have twenty years’ seniority. This, of course, would not have been possible until at least twenty years after the founding of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha. By that time, however, Mahāpajāpatī would likely have been too old to make the long journey to Vesālī by foot.</q></span></p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p550 href=#p550>550</a></span>(3) “And what is good friendship? Here, in whatever village or town a clansman lives, he associates with householders or their sons—whether young but of mature virtue, or old and of mature virtue—who are accomplished in faith, virtuous behavior, generosity, and wisdom; he converses with them and engages in discussions with them. Insofar as they are accomplished in faith, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment <a id="calibre_link-5597"></a>in faith; insofar as they are accomplished in virtuous behavior, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in virtuous behavior; insofar as they are accomplished in generosity, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in generosity; insofar as they are accomplished in wisdom, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in wisdom.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p624 href=#p624>624</a></span>Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p626 href=#p626>626</a></span>“It is in just this way that some hollow men here make requests of me, but when the Dhamma has been explained, they think only of following me around.”<span class=note><sup id=note1764>1764</sup><q><em>Dhamme ca bhāsite mamaññeva anubandhitabbaṃ maññanti</em>. Mp: “It is said that although an exhortation was given [to him], this bhikkhu remained heedless. Having heard the Dhamma, he just hung around but did not want to strive. Therefore the Blessed One rebuked him.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p628 href=#p628>628</a></span>“In that case, bhikkhu, you should train yourself thus: ‘My mind will be firm and well settled internally. Arisen bad unwholesome states will not obsess my mind.’ Thus should you train yourself.</p>

Thus you should develop it according to the method “with thought and examination” and so forth.’” While, in the jhāna scheme of the Nikāyas, the transition from the first to the second jhāna is marked by the simultaneous elimination of thought (<em>vitakka</em>) and examination (<em>vicāra</em>), other texts distinguish <em>samādhi</em> as threefold: as with thought and examination, without thought but with examination, and without thought and examination (see DN 33.1.10, III 219,<small>19–20</small>; MN 128.31, III 162,<small>13–16</small>; SN <a class=seesutta href=SN43.html#s3>43:3</a>, IV 360,<small>11–13</small>). This middle stage of <em>samādhi</em> gave rise, in the Abhidhamma, to a fivefold scheme of jhānas that inserts, after the first jhāna, a second jhāna that is without thought but with examination. This scheme then renumbers the second, third, and fourth jhānas of the fourfold scheme as the third, fourth, and fifth jhānas to obtain a fivefold scheme. The <em>samādhi</em> with rapture (<em>sappītika</em>) includes the first and second jhānas (of the fourfold scheme); that without rapture (<em>nippītika</em>) includes the third and fourth jhānas.

Doing the preliminary work on a yellow form, he uses bodily fat, the skin, or the surfaces of the hands and feet, or a yellow area in the eyes. Doing the preliminary work on a red form, he uses flesh, blood, the tongue, or a red area in the eyes.

This isn’t troublesome for me.’ Having overcome those forms, he enters an attainment, and with the arising of the mark he reaches absorption. <em>He is percipient thus</em> (<em>evaṃsaññī hoti</em>): He is percipient with the perception of reflective attention (<em>ābhoga</em>) and with the perception of the jhāna. ‘<em>I know, I see</em>’ (<em>jānāmi passāmi</em>): By this, his reflective attention is spoken of; for that occurs after he has emerged from the attainment, not in the attainment itself.

[Mp-ṭ: The inversions of perception and thought that take the unattractive as attractive and the painful as pleasurable.] Māra obsessed his mind by displaying a frightful sight. On seeing this, the elder failed to pick up the clear hint given him by the Buddha.”</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p677 href=#p677>677</a></span>A second time … A third time the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Delightful is Vesālī … Delightful is the Udena Shrine … delightful the Cāpāla Shrine.

The Tathāgata, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency, made them a vehicle and basis, carried them out, consolidated them, and properly undertaken them.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p751 href=#p751>751</a></span>(1) “And what is accomplishment in initiative? Here, whatever may be the means by which a clansman earns his living—whether by farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or by some other craft [323]—he is skillful and diligent; he possesses sound judgment about it in order to carry out and arrange it properly. This is called accomplishment in initiative.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p752 href=#p752>752</a></span>(2) “And what is accomplishment in protection? Here, a clansman sets up protection and guard over the wealth he has acquired by initiative and energy, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, thinking: <em>‘</em>How can I prevent kings and thieves from taking it, fire from burning it, floods from sweeping it off, and displeasing heirs from taking it?’ This is called accomplishment in protection.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p753 href=#p753>753</a></span>(3) “And what is good friendship? Here, in whatever village or town a clansman lives, he associates with householders or their sons—whether young but of mature virtue, or old and of mature virtue—who are accomplished in faith, virtuous behavior, generosity, and wisdom; he converses with them and engages in discussions with them. Insofar as they are accomplished in faith, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in faith; insofar as they are accomplished in virtuous behavior, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in virtuous behavior; insofar as they are accomplished in generosity, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in generosity; insofar as they are accomplished in wisdom, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in wisdom. This is called good friendship.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p754 href=#p754>754</a></span>(4) “And what is balanced living? Here, a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, [aware]: <a id="calibre_link-5618"></a>‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.’ Just as an appraiser or his apprentice, holding up a scale, knows: <em>‘</em>By so much it has dipped down, [324] by so much it has gone up,’ so a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, [aware]: ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p755 href=#p755>755</a></span>“If this clansman has a small income but lives luxuriously, others would say of him: ‘This clansman eats his wealth just like an eater of figs.’ But if he has a large income but lives sparingly, others would say of him: ‘This clansman may even starve himself.’ But it is called balanced living when a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, [aware]: ‘Thus my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p756 href=#p756>756</a></span>(5) “And what is accomplishment in faith? Here, a clansman is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: <em>‘</em>The Blessed One is an arahant … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ This is called accomplishment in faith.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p757 href=#p757>757</a></span>(6) “And what is accomplishment in virtuous behavior? Here, a clansman abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called accomplishment in virtuous behavior.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p758 href=#p758>758</a></span>(7) “And what is accomplishment in generosity? Here, a clansman dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. This is called accomplishment in generosity.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p759 href=#p759>759</a></span>(8) “And what is accomplishment in wisdom?

They are <em>headed by concentration</em> (<em>samādhippamukhā</em>) in the sense that concentration is a controlling faculty (an <em>indriya</em>) whose lead all elements of our experience must follow. They are under <em>the authority of mindfulness</em> (<em>satādhipateyyā</em>) because mindfulness is another controlling faculty which directs us in whatever we do or experience. All things have <em>wisdom as supervisor</em> (<em>paññuttarā</em>) because wisdom is the chief of the controlling faculties; wisdom, more than anything else, controls our experience (the last three factors are what allow us to get a sense of being in charge of our lives).

There the Blessed One dwelled in the Icchānaṅgala woodland thicket.
