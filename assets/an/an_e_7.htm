Lit., “one who attains nibbāna in between (or along the way).” Pp 16 (Be §36) defines this person as one who eliminates the five lower fetters, takes spontaneous birth, and then, either immediately after being reborn or (at the latest) before reaching the middle of the life span, generates the path for abandoning the five higher fetters. Similarly, Mp defines this type as a person who is reborn somewhere among the pure abodes (<em>suddhāvāsesu</em>) and then attains arahantship either at the time of rebirth, slightly afterward, or before reaching the middle of the life span. In spite of these authorized definitions, I believe there is textual evidence that the name of this type should be understood to mean literally that he attains the destruction of the taints <em>in between</em> or <em>along the way</em> (<em>antarā</em>), that is, between two lives, and then attains final nibbāna without taking rebirth at all. See <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN4.html#s131>4:131</a></strong> and <a class=seenote href=AN4.html#note829>AN4, note 829</a>. I give further arguments for this interpretation below in note 1536 on p. 1782.</q></span> This is the third kind of person worthy of gifts….</p>

Both Pp 17 (Be §37) and Mp define this type as one who eliminates the five lower fetters, takes spontaneous rebirth (in the pure abodes), and then reaches arahantship after passing the middle of the life span or, at the latest, at the time of death. Again, as I will maintain in relation to <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN7.html#s55>7:55</a></strong>, there are suggestions in the Nikāyas that this type is one who attains the destruction of the taints almost immediately after taking rebirth in the pure abodes.

Pp 17 (Be §§38–39) says merely that one generates the path without effort and the other as the result of effort. In any case, on the commentarial interpretation these two become, not separate types of non-returners, but two modes in which the first two types (the <em>antarāparinibbāyī</em> and the <em>upahaccaparinibbāyī</em>) attain nibbāna. Such an explanation would reduce the distinct types of non-returners to three.

For they call a Nigaṇṭha [a Jain ascetic] <em>niddaso</em> (“ten-less”) who has died at the time he is ten years of age [<em>dasavassakāle</em>; or: “at the time he has ten years’ seniority” (as an ascetic)?]. For, it is said, he does not become ten years of age again. And not only doesn’t he become ten years of age again, [he doesn’t become] nine years of age or even one year of age. In this way, they call a Nigaṇṭha who is dead at the age of twenty years, and so on, <em>nibbīso</em> (‘twenty-less’), <em>nittiṃso</em> (‘thirty-less’), <em>niccattālīso</em> (‘forty-less’), <em>nippaññāso</em> (‘fifty-less’). When Ānanda was wandering in the village, he heard this discussion and reported it to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said: ‘This is not a designation for the sectarians, Ānanda, but for the taint-destroyer [arahant] in my teaching.’ For if the taint-destroyer attains final nibbāna when he is ten years of age [or: has ten years’ seniority?], he does not become one of ten years again. Not only one of ten years, he doesn’t become one of nine years … of a single year. Not only one of a single year, he doesn’t become one of eleven months … nor even one of a single moment. Why? Because he never again takes rebirth. The same method for one who is ‘twenty-less’ and so on.

Then the Blessed One, as if gaining control of a black snake with a mantra or as if stepping on an enemy’s neck with his foot, roars his lion’s roar.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p426 href=#p426>426</a></span>When this was said, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said to the Blessed One: <span class=note><sup id=note1549>1549</sup><q>The following exchange is also at MN 37.2–3, I 251–52, but with Sakka as the inquirer. Mp explains the passage thus: “<em>Nothing</em> (lit., <em>not all things</em>) <em>is worth holding to</em> (<em>sabbe dhammā nālaṃ abhinivesāya</em>): here, ‘all things’ (<em>sabbe dhammā</em>) are the five aggregates, the twelve sense bases, and the eighteen elements. These are not worth holding to by way of craving and views. Why not? Because they do not exist in the way they are held to. They are held to be permanent, pleasurable, and self, but they turn out to be impermanent, suffering, and non-self. Therefore they are not worth holding to. One <em>directly knows them</em> by the full understanding of the known (<em>ñātapariññāya abhijānāti</em>) as impermanent, suffering, and non-self. One <em>fully understands them</em> in the same way by the full understanding of scrutinization (<em>tīraṇapariññāya parijānāti</em>).” The “all things” in my translation from Mp relates to the “nothing” of the sutta, since the Pāli phrase of the sutta is a negation of <em>sabbe dhammā</em> (“not all things”). On the three kinds of full understanding (<em>pariññā</em>), see Vism 606,<small>18</small>–607,<small>23</small>, Ppn 20.3–6.</q></span> “Briefly, Bhante, how is a bhikkhu liberated in the extinction of craving, best among devas and humans: one who has reached the ultimate conclusion, won ultimate security from bondage, lived the ultimate spiritual life, and gained the ultimate consummation?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p427 href=#p427>427</a></span>“Here, Moggallāna, a bhikkhu has heard: ‘Nothing is worth holding to.’ When a bhikkhu has heard: ‘Nothing is worth holding to,’ he directly knows all things. Having directly known all things, he fully understands all things. Having fully understood all things, whatever feeling he feels—whether pleasant, painful, or neither painful nor pleasant—he dwells contemplating impermanence in those feelings, contemplating fading <a id="calibre_link-5682"></a>away in those feelings, contemplating cessation in those feelings, contemplating relinquishment in those feelings. As he dwells contemplating impermanence … fading away … cessation … relinquishment in those feelings, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains nibbāna. He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p428 href=#p428>428</a></span>“Briefly, Moggallāna, it is in this way that a bhikkhu is best among devas and humans: one who has reached the ultimate conclusion, won ultimate security from bondage, lived the ultimate spiritual life, and gained the ultimate consummation.”</p>

It is said that they enter the opponents’ army and fly about cutting them up as if into lumps (<em>piṇḍapiṇḍamiva</em>); having risen up, they come out; or else it is those who take food and drink to the warriors in the midst of the battle. [I have translated based on this second derivation, which seems more plausible.] <em>Pakkhandhino</em> (“front-line commandoes”) are those who ask: “Whose head or weapon shall we bring?” and when told, “His!” they leap (<em>pakkhandanti</em>) into the midst of battle and bring it. <em>Mahānāgā</em> (“great-bull warriors”) are warriors who cannot be turned back even when elephants, etc., are coming straight at them. <em>Sūrā</em> (“attack-soldiers”) are one type of hero, who can cross the ocean even while wearing a coat of mail or carrying armor. <em>Cammayodhino</em> (“shield-bearing soldiers”) are those who wear a coat of leather mail, or who carry a leather shield as protection against arrows. <em>Dāsakaputtā</em> (“domestic-slave soldiers”): deeply affectionate domestic-slave soldiers. Mp explains <em>uggā rājaputtā</em> as “royal sons experienced in battle who have risen higher and higher” (<em>uggatuggatā saṅgāmāvacarā rājaputtā</em>). Mp thus derives the word from <em>uggata</em>, but SED says the <em>ugra</em> were “a mixed tribe (from a Kshatriya father and a Śūdra mother).” The word, according to SED, means “powerful, violent, mighty … cruel, fierce.”</q></span> A king’s frontier fortress is well provided with this fifth appurtenance for protecting its inhabitants and for warding off outsiders.</p>

Those who returned to lay life had been going around violating the lesser and minor training rules. And those who attained arahantship had purified their behavior. The Teacher’s discourse was fruitful for all three. [Question:] Granted it was fruitful for those who attained arahantship, how was it fruitful for the others? [Reply:] Because if they had not heard this discourse, [the first kind] would have become heedless and would not have been able to abandon their condition. Their evil behavior would have increased and dragged them down to the realms of misery. But when they heard this discourse, they were filled with a sense of urgency. Having abandoned their condition, some became sāmaṇeras (novices), fulfilled the ten precepts, applied themselves to careful attention, and became stream-enterers, once-returners, or non-returners, while some were reborn in the deva world. Thus it was fruitful even for those who had committed <em>pārājikas</em>. If the others had not heard this discourse, as time went on, they would have gradually committed <em>saṅghādisesas</em> and <em>pārājikas</em>. They would have been reborn in the realms of misery and experienced great suffering. But having heard it, thinking that they could not fulfill the practice all their lives, they gave up the training and returned to lay life. They became settled in the three refuges, observed the five precepts, fulfilled the duty of a lay follower, and became stream-enterers, once-returners, or non-returners, while some were reborn in the deva world. Thus the discourse was fruitful for them, too.”</q></span></p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p632 href=#p632>632</a></span>“Bhikkhus, in the past there was a teacher named Araka, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures. The teacher Araka had many hundreds of disciples to whom he taught such a Dhamma as this: ‘Brahmins, short is the life of human beings, limited and fleeting; it has much suffering, much misery. One should wisely understand this. [137] One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life; for none who are born can escape death.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p633 href=#p633>633</a></span>(1) “‘Just as a drop of dew on the tip of a blade of grass will quickly vanish at sunrise and will not last long, so too, brahmins, human life is like a drop of dew. It is limited and fleeting; it has much suffering, much misery. One should wisely understand this. One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life; for none who are born can escape death.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p634 href=#p634>634</a></span>(2) “‘Just as, when thick drops of rain are pouring down, a water bubble will quickly vanish and will not last long, so too, brahmins, human life is like a water bubble. It is limited … for none who are born can escape death.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p635 href=#p635>635</a></span>(3) “‘Just as a line drawn on water with a stick will quickly vanish and will not last long, so too, brahmins, human life is like a line drawn on water with a stick. It is limited … for none who are born can escape death.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p636 href=#p636>636</a></span>(4) “‘Just as a river flowing down from a mountain, going a long distance, with a swift current, carrying along much flotsam, will not stand still for a moment, an instant, a second, but will rush on, swirl, and flow forward, so too, brahmins, human life is like a mountain stream. It is limited … for none who are born can escape death.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p637 href=#p637>637</a></span>(5) “‘Just as a strong man might form a lump of spittle at the tip of his tongue and spit it out without difficulty, so too, brahmins, human life is like a lump of spittle. It is limited … for none who are born can escape death.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p638 href=#p638>638</a></span>(6) “‘Just as [138] a piece of meat thrown into an iron pan heated all day will quickly vanish and will not last long, so too, brahmins, human life is like this piece of meat. It is limited … for none who are born can escape death.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p639 href=#p639>639</a></span>(7) “‘Just as, when a cow to be slaughtered is being led to the slaughterhouse, whatever leg she lifts, she is close to slaughter, close to death, so too, brahmins, human life is like a cow doomed to slaughter. It is limited and fleeting; it has much suffering, much misery. One should wisely understand this. One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life; for none who are born can escape death.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p640 href=#p640>640</a></span>“But at that time, bhikkhus, the human life span was 60,000 years, and girls were marriageable at the age of five hundred. At that time, people had but six afflictions: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, excrement, and urine. Though people had such long life spans and lived so long, and though their afflictions were so few, still, the teacher Araka gave his disciples such a teaching: ‘Brahmins, short is the life of human beings … for none who are born can escape death.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p641 href=#p641>641</a></span>“But nowadays, bhikkhus, one could rightly say: ‘Short is the life of human beings, limited and fleeting; it has much suffering, much misery. One should wisely understand this. One should do what is wholesome and lead the spiritual life; for none who are born can escape death.’ For today one who lives long lives for a hundred years or a little more. And when living for a hundred years, one lives just for three hundred seasons: a hundred winters, a hundred summers, and a hundred rains. When living for three hundred seasons, one lives just for twelve hundred months: four hundred [139] winter months, four hundred summer months, and four hundred months of the rains. When living for twelve hundred months, one lives just for twenty-four hundred fortnights: eight hundred fortnights of winter, eight hundred fortnights of summer, and eight hundred fortnights of the rains.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p642 href=#p642>642</a></span>“And when living for twenty-four hundred fortnights, one lives just for 36,000 nights: 12,000 nights of winter, 12,000 nights of summer, and 12,000 nights of the rains.<span class=note><sup id=note1601>1601</sup><q>The text uses <em>ratti</em>, “night” as the reckoning for a twenty-fourhour period, as is common in Buddhist canonical literature.</q></span> And when living for 36,000 nights, one eats just 72,000 meals: 24,000 meals in winter, 24,000 in summer, and 24,000 in the rains. And this includes the taking of mother’s milk and the [times when there are] obstacles to meals. These are the obstacles to meals: one who is angry<span class=note><sup id=note1602>1602</sup><q>Reading with Ce and Ee <em>kupito</em>, as against Be <em>kapimiddho</em>, “monkey sleep.”</q></span> does not eat a meal, one in pain does not eat a meal, one who is ill does not eat a meal, one observing the uposatha does not eat a meal, and when not obtaining [food] one does not eat a meal.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p643 href=#p643>643</a></span>“Thus, bhikkhus, for a human being with a life span of a hundred years, I have reckoned his life span, the limit of his life span, the number of seasons, years, months, and fortnights [in his life]; the number of his nights, days,<span class=note><sup id=note1603>1603</sup><q>I follow Ce and Be, which read <em>rattipi saṅkhātā, divāpi saṅkhātā</em>.</q></span> and meals, and <a id="calibre_link-5466"></a>the obstacles to meals. Whatever, bhikkhus, should be done by a compassionate teacher out of compassion for his disciples, seeking their welfare, that I have done for you. These are the feet of trees, these are empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not be heedless. Do not have cause to regret it later. This is our instruction to you.” [140]</p>
