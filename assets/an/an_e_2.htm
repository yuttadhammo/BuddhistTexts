<h2><a id=l288 href=#l307><span class=bigcap>I. E</span><span class=smallcap>NTERING UPON THE</span> <span class=bigcap>R</span><span class=smallcap>AINS</span></a></h2>
<h3><a id=s1 href=#m1>1 (1) Faults</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1 href=#p1>1</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p2 href=#p2>2</a></span>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p3 href=#p3>3</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these two faults. What two? The fault pertaining to the present life and the fault pertaining to the future life.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p4 href=#p4>4</a></span>“And what is the fault pertaining to the present life? Here, someone sees that when kings arrest a robber, a criminal, they subject him to various punishments: they have him flogged with whips, beaten with canes, beaten with clubs; they have his hands cut off, his feet cut off, his hands and feet cut off; his ears cut off, his nose cut off, his ears and nose cut off; they have him subjected to the ‘porridge pot,’ to the ‘polished-shell shave,’ to the ‘Rāhu’s mouth,’ to the ‘fiery wreath,’ to the ‘flaming hand,’ to the ‘blades of grass,’ [48] to the ‘bark dress,’ to the ‘antelope,’ to the ‘meat hooks,’ to the ‘coins,’ to the ‘lye pickling,’ to the ‘pivoting pin,’ to the ‘rolled-up palliasse’; and they have him splashed with boiling oil, and they have him devoured by dogs, and they have him impaled alive on stakes, and they have his head cut off with a sword.<span class=note><sup id=note216>216</sup><q>Mp gives detailed explanations of all these punishments. I translate only the first few and leave the rest to the reader’s imagination. (1) The <em>porridge pot</em> (<em>bilaṅgathālika</em>): they crack open his skull, take up a hot iron ball with tongs, put the ball inside, and boil his brains until they overflow. (2) The <em>polished-shell shave</em> (<em>saṅkhamuṇḍika</em>): they cut the skin [in the area] bounded by his upper lip, the roots of the ears, and gullet, bind all his head hairs into a knot, tie them around a stick, and pull it up, so that his skin together with his head hairs comes off; then they rub his skull with coarse sand and wash it, until it becomes the color of a conch shell. (3) <em>Rāhu’s mouth</em> (<em>rāhumukha</em>): they force open his mouth with a spike and burn a lamp inside his mouth, or they dig into his mouth with a spade until the blood flows and fills his mouth. (4) The <em>fiery wreath</em> (<em>jotimālika</em>): they wind an oiled cloth around his entire body and ignite it. (5) The <em>flaming hand</em> (<em>hatthapajjotika</em>): they wind an oiled cloth around his hand and ignite it so that it burns like a lamp.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p5 href=#p5>5</a></span>“It occurs to him: ‘When kings have arrested a robber, a criminal, they subject him to various punishments because of his bad deeds: they have him flogged with whips … they have his <a id="calibre_link-5292"></a>head cut off with a sword. Now if I were to commit such a bad deed, and if kings were to arrest me, they would subject me to the same punishments. They would have me flogged with whips … they would have my head cut off with a sword.’ Afraid of the fault pertaining to the present life, he does not plunder the belongings of others.<span class=note><sup id=note217>217</sup><q>Mp: “Even if a bundle of a thousand [gold pieces] had fallen along the road, he would not steal it thinking to support himself with it, but he would turn it over with his heel and go his way, thinking: ‘What need do I have with this?’”</q></span> This is called the fault pertaining to the present life.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p6 href=#p6>6</a></span>“And what is the fault pertaining to the future life? Here, someone reflects thus: ‘Bodily misconduct has a bad, painful result<span class=note><sup id=note218>218</sup><q>Both Ce and Be read <em>pāpako dukkho vipāko</em> here, as against Ee <em>pāpako vipāko.</em></q></span> in the future life; verbal misconduct has a bad, painful result in the future life; mental misconduct has a bad, painful result in the future life. Now if I were to engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, then, with the breakup of the body, after death, I would be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell!’ [49] Afraid of the fault pertaining to the future life, he abandons bodily misconduct and develops bodily good conduct; he abandons verbal misconduct and develops verbal good conduct; he abandons mental misconduct and develops mental good conduct; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the fault pertaining to the future life.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p7 href=#p7>7</a></span>“These, bhikkhus, are the two faults. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will fear the fault pertaining to the present life; we will fear the fault pertaining to the future life. We will be fearful of faults and see peril in faults.’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves. It is to be expected that one who is fearful of faults and sees peril in faults will be freed from all faults.”</p>
<h3><a id=s2 href=#m2>2 (2) Striving</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p8 href=#p8>8</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these two strivings that are hard to achieve in the world. What two? The striving of laypeople who dwell at home for the purpose of presenting [monastics with] robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, and the striving of those who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness for the relinquishment of all acquisitions. These are the two strivings that are hard to achieve in the world.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p9 href=#p9>9</a></span>“Of these two strivings, bhikkhus, the foremost is the striving for the relinquishment of all acquisitions.<span class=note><sup id=note219>219</sup><q><em>Sabbūpadhipaṭinissagga</em>. Mp specifies three types of “acquisitions” (<em>upadhi</em>): the five aggregates, the defilements, and volitional activities (<em>khandha</em>, <em>kilesa</em>, <em>abhisaṅkhārā</em>). The relinquishment of these is a synonym for nibbāna. The striving for this is the energy arisen along with insight and the path.</q></span> Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will strive for the <a id="calibre_link-5293"></a>relinquishment of all acquisitions.’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves.”</p>
<h3><a id=s3 href=#m3>3 (3) Causing Torment</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p10 href=#p10>10</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these two things that cause torment. What two? Here, someone has engaged in bodily misconduct but failed to engage in bodily good conduct; engaged in verbal misconduct but failed to engage in verbal good conduct; engaged in mental misconduct but failed to engage in mental good conduct. He is tormented, [thinking]: ‘I have engaged in bodily misconduct’; he is tormented, [thinking]: ‘I have failed to engage in bodily good conduct’; he is tormented, [thinking]: ‘I have engaged in verbal misconduct’; he is tormented, [thinking]: ‘I have failed to engage in verbal good conduct’; he is tormented, [thinking]: ‘I have engaged in mental misconduct’; he is tormented, [thinking]: ‘I have failed to engage in mental good conduct.’ These, bhikkhus, are the two things that cause torment.”<span class=note><sup id=note220>220</sup><q>The two things that cause torment (<em>dhammā tapanīyā</em>) are not expressly stated as such in the text, but it is clear that they are (1) engaging in misconduct, and (2) failing to engage in good conduct. The same applies, with appropriate changes, to the following sutta.</q></span></p>
<h3><a id=s4 href=#m4>4 (4) Not Causing Torment</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p11 href=#p11>11</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these two things that do not cause torment. [50] What two? Here, someone has engaged in bodily good conduct and avoided engaging in bodily misconduct; engaged in verbal good conduct and avoided engaging in verbal misconduct; engaged in mental good conduct and avoided engaging in mental misconduct. He is not tormented, [knowing]: ‘I have engaged in bodily good conduct’; he is not tormented, [knowing]: ‘I have avoided engaging in bodily misconduct’; he is not tormented, [knowing]: ‘I have engaged in verbal good conduct’; he is not tormented, [knowing]: ‘I have avoided engaging in verbal misconduct’; he is not tormented, [knowing]: ‘I have engaged in mental good conduct’; he is not tormented, [knowing]: ‘I have avoided engaging in mental misconduct.’ These, bhikkhus, are the two things that do not cause torment.”</p>
<h3><a id=s5 href=#m5>5 (5) Known</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p12 href=#p12>12</a></span>“Bhikkhus, I have personally known two things: non-contentment in regard to wholesome qualities and indefatigability in striving.<span class=note><sup id=note221>221</sup><q>Mp: “By <em>non-contentment in regard to wholesome qualities</em> (<em>asantuṭṭhitā kusalesu dhammesu</em>) he shows: ‘Not being content merely with jhāna or the luminous mark [of concentration], I aroused the path of arahantship. Until that arose, I was not content. And being dissatisfied in striving, I strove on, standing firm without retreating.’ ‘Indefatigability’ (<em>appaṭivānitā</em>) means not turning back, not retreating. By <em>I strove indefatigably</em>, what is meant is this: ‘When I was a bodhisatta, I strove on, not retreating, aspiring for omniscience.’”</q></span> I strove indefatigably, [resolved]: ‘Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh <a id="calibre_link-5649"></a>and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.’<span class=note><sup id=note222>222</sup><q>This determination is found elsewhere in the Nikāyas: in AN at <strong><a class=seesutta href=SN8.html#s13>8:13</a> §8</strong>, IV 190,<small>8–12</small>; MN 70.27, I 481,<small>1–5</small>; and SN <a class=seesutta href=SN12.html#s22>12:22</a>, II 28,<small>24–28</small>.</q></span> It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenment, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I achieved the unsurpassed security from bondage.<span class=note><sup id=note223>223</sup><q>Mp: “<em>Heedfulness</em> (<em>appamāda</em>) consists in non-separation from mindfulness. <em>Unsurpassed security from bondage</em> (<em>anuttara yogakkhema</em>): by heedfulness he attained not only enlightenment but also unsurpassed security from bondage, consisting in the fruit of arahantship and nibbāna.”</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p13 href=#p13>13</a></span>“If, bhikkhus, you too would strive indefatigably, [resolved]: ‘Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion,’ you too will, in no long time, realize for yourselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, you will dwell in it. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will strive indefatigably, [resolved]: “Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.”’ It is in such a way that you should train yourselves.”</p>
<h3><a id=s6 href=#m6>6 (6) Fetter</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p14 href=#p14>14</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these two things. What two? Contemplation of gratification in things that can fetter and contemplation of disenchantment in things that can fetter.<span class=note><sup id=note224>224</sup><q>See SN <a class=seesutta href=SN12.html#s53>12:53</a>, II 86; SN <a class=seesutta href=SN12.html#s54>12:54</a>, II 87; SN <a class=seesutta href=SN12.html#s57>12:57</a>–59, II 89–91.</q></span> One who dwells contemplating gratification in things that can fetter does [51] not abandon lust, hatred, and delusion. Not having abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, one is not freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; one is not freed from suffering, I say. One who dwells contemplating disenchantment in things that can fetter abandons lust, hatred, and delusion. Having abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, one is freed from birth, from old age and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish; one is freed from suffering, I say. These, bhikkhus, are the two things.”</p>
<h3><a id=s7 href=#m7>7 (7) Dark</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p15 href=#p15>15</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these two dark qualities. What two? Moral shamelessness and moral recklessness. These are the two dark qualities.”</p>
<h3><a id=s8 href=#m8>8 (8) Bright</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p16 href=#p16>16</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these two bright qualities. What two? Moral shame and moral dread.<span class=note><sup id=note225>225</sup><q>Moral shame (<em>hiri</em>) is disgust at bodily and verbal misconduct; moral dread (<em>ottappa</em>) is moral dread over such misconduct. Moral shame is directed inwardly. It arises from self-respect and induces one to reject wrongdoing based on the sense of one’s own inherent dignity. Moral dread has an outward direction. It arises from fear of blame and induces one to reject wrongdoing based on fear of the consequences. For more details, see CMA 86, As 124–25, and Vism 464,<small>31</small>–465,<small>4</small>, Ppn 14.142.</q></span> These are the two bright qualities.”</p>
<h3><a id=s9 href=#m9>9 (9) Behavior</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p17 href=#p17>17</a></span>“Bhikkhus, these two bright qualities protect the world. What two? Moral shame and moral dread. If these two bright qualities did not protect the world, there would not be seen here [any restraint regarding] one’s mother, aunts, or the wives of one’s teachers and [other] respected people.<span class=note><sup id=note226>226</sup><q><em>Mātucchā</em> is one’s maternal aunt; <em>mātulāni</em>, the wife of one’s mother’s brother. For simplicity’s sake I refer to them jointly as “aunts.”</q></span> The world would become promiscuous, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, dogs and jackals. But because these two bright qualities protect the world, there is seen here [restraint regarding] one’s mother, aunts, or the wives of one’s teachers and [other] respected people.”</p>
<h3><a id=s10 href=#m10>10 (10) Entering upon the Rains</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p18 href=#p18>18</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these two [occasions for] entering upon the rains.<span class=note><sup id=note227>227</sup><q><em>Vassūpanāyikā</em>. The three-month rains residence is observed by monastics during the Indian rainy season. During this period, bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs must remain for three months at their chosen place of residence, though they are permitted to leave for up to seven days if there is a suitable reason. The earlier three-month rains period extends from the day after the full moon of Āsāḷha (normally occurring in July or early August) to the full moon of Kattika (normally in October or early November). The later three-month rains period begins and ends one month after the earlier one.</q></span> What two? The earlier and the later. These are the two [occasions for] entering upon the rains.” [52]</p>

These are dealt with in detail at Vin II 88–92. Briefly, an issue involving a dispute arises when monks or nuns dispute about the Dhamma and the Vinaya; an issue involving an accusation arises when they accuse another member of committing a transgression; an issue involving an offense arises when a monk or nun who has committed a transgression seeks rehabilitation; and an issue involving procedure deals with the collective procedures of the Saṅgha. Methods for settling disciplinary issues (<em>adhikaraṇasamatha</em>) are explained at MN 104.12–20, II 247–50.

It would be peculiar for such a distinction to be intended here. Since both craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) and greed (<em>lobha</em>) can refer to the desire for continued existence (<em>bhavataṇhā</em>, <em>bhavarāga</em>), and since it seems improbable that, after alluding to the highest realization, Sāriputta would then revert to a lower level, this sentence may simply be continuing the description of one practicing to attain arahantship.</q></span> With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a certain order of devas. Passing away from there, he is a non-returner, one who does not return to this state of being.

At the conclusion of the discourse, deities numbering hundreds of thousand of <em>koṭis</em> (a <em>koṭi</em> = ten million) attained arahantship, and there was no counting the number of those who became stream-enterers and so forth.”</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p100 href=#p100>100</a></span>Then a number of same-minded deities<span class=note><sup id=note264>264</sup><q>Mp explains <em>samacittā</em> to mean “with the same mind,” thereby resolving an ambiguity in the Pāli term. Though in Skt the difference between <em>śama</em> = “peace” and <em>sama</em> = “same, equal” would have been clear, in most dialects of Middle Indo-Aryan (including Pāli) the two words would be indistinguishable and thus their meanings could be conflated. Mp construes <em>sama</em> as equivalent to Skt <em>sama</em>, “same, equal”: “They are called ‘sameminded’ because of the similarity in the subtlety of their mind (<em>cittassa sukhumabhāvasamatāya samacittā</em>); for they had created their own bodies with minds of similar subtlety (<em>sukhume cittasarikkhake katvā</em>).” Mp gives other explanations of <em>samacittā</em>, but all assume the meaning is “with the same mind.” The Chinese parallel (at T I 449b<small>1</small>) reads <img src="images/000027.jpg" class="calibre56"> = “same-minded deities,” thus agreeing with Mp. This indicates that the original on which the Chinese translation was based either had <em>samacittā</em> in a language that made a distinction between <em>śama</em> and <em>sama</em>, or, if preserved in a language that did not make such a distinction, had been accompanied by an explanation of the term as meaning “sameminded.” However, the expressions <em>santindriyā</em> and <em>santamānasā</em> toward the end of the sutta, both related to the Skt <em>śama</em>, suggest that the original meaning could have been “peaceful minded,” unless ambivalence was deliberate.</q></span> approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: “Bhante, at Migāramātā’s Mansion in the Eastern Park, Venerable Sāriputta is teaching the bhikkhus about the person fettered internally and the person fettered externally. The assembly is thrilled. It would be good, Bhante, if the Blessed One would approach the Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion.”<span class=note><sup id=note265>265</sup><q><em>Anukampaṃ upādāya</em>. Mp: “Not out of compassion for Sāriputta, for on that occasion there was no need to show compassion for the elder [Sāriputta] … who had already reached the perfection of a disciple’s knowledge. Rather, they ask the Blessed One to go out of compassion for the other devas and humans who had assembled there.” Despite the commentary, it may be the case that the devas actually wanted the Buddha to approach Sāriputta for his own sake. Sāriputta probably did not have the supernormal ability to see the hosts of devas that had assembled to hear him speak and thus the Buddha had to inform him of this. At Ud 40,<small>28–29</small>, Sāriputta says that he does not even see a mud sprite (<em>mayaṃ pan’etarahi paṃsupisācakampi na passāma</em>).</q></span> The Blessed One consented by silence.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p101 href=#p101>101</a></span>Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Blessed One disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared at Migāramātā’s Mansion in the Eastern Park in the presence of the Venerable Sāriputta. He sat down in the seat that was prepared. The Venerable Sāriputta [65] paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to the Venerable Sāriputta:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p102 href=#p102>102</a></span>“Here, Sāriputta, a number of same-minded deities approached me, paid homage to me, stood to one side, and said: ‘Bhante, at Migāramātā’s Mansion in the Eastern Park, Venerable Sāriputta is teaching the bhikkhus about the person fettered internally and the person fettered externally. The assembly is thrilled. It would be good, Bhante, if the Blessed One would approach the Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p103 href=#p103>103</a></span>“Those deities—ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, and even sixty in number—stand in an area even as small as the tip of an awl <a id="calibre_link-5474"></a>yet do not encroach upon one another. It may be, Sāriputta, that you think: ‘Surely, it was there that those deities developed their minds in such a way that ten … and even sixty in number stand in an area even as small as the tip of an awl yet do not encroach upon one another.’ But this should not be regarded in such a way. Rather, it was right here that those deities developed their minds in such a way that ten … and even sixty in number stand in an area even as small as the tip of an awl yet do not encroach upon one another.<span class=note><sup id=note266>266</sup><q>Mp: “<em>It was right here</em> (<em>idh’eva</em>): It was in this human world and under this teaching that those deities had developed their minds in such a way that they were reborn in a peaceful form-sphere existence. Having come from there, they have created subtle bodies. While those deities might have reached three paths and fruits in Buddha Kassapa’s teaching, because all Buddhas have the same teaching, with the words ‘right here’ he refers to the teaching as one.” The Chinese parallel is more explicit than the Pāli: “It was in the past when they were human beings that those same-minded deities developed such a wholesome mind, such an extremely vast and great mind.”</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p104 href=#p104>104</a></span>“Therefore, Sāriputta, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will have peaceful sense faculties and peaceful minds.’<span class=note><sup id=note267>267</sup><q><em>Santindriyā bhavissāma santamānasā</em>. As noted in note 264 above, the repeated use of the word <em>santa</em> here and just below suggests that <em>samacittā</em>, in relation to the deities, could have meant “peaceful minded”—this despite the agreement between Mp and the Chinese translation on “same-minded.”</q></span> It is in such a way that you should train yourselves. When you have peaceful sense faculties and peaceful minds, your bodily action will be peaceful, your verbal action will be peaceful, and your mental action will be peaceful.
