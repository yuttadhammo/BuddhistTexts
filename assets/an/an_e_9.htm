<h2><a id=l2202 href=#l2214><span class="italic">The First Fifty</span></a></h2>
<h2><a id=l2203 href=#l2215><span class=bigcap>I. E</span><span class=smallcap>NLIGHTENMENT</span></a></h2>
<h3><a id=s1 href=#m1>1 (1) Enlightenment</a><span class=note><sup id=note1821>1821</sup><q>This is a composite nine, obtained by combining the five proximate causes and the four meditation subjects.</q></span></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1 href=#p1>1</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p2 href=#p2>2</a></span>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p3 href=#p3>3</a></span>“Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects may ask you: ‘What, friends, is the proximate cause for the development of the aids to enlightenment?’ If you are asked thus, how would you answer them?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p4 href=#p4>4</a></span>“Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p5 href=#p5>5</a></span>“Then listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely. I will speak.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p6 href=#p6>6</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p7 href=#p7>7</a></span>“Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects should ask you: ‘What, friends, is the proximate cause for the development of the aids to enlightenment?’ you should answer them as follows.</p>
<p id="calibre_link-5509" class="calibre21">(1) “‘Here, friends, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, [352] good comrades. This is the first proximate cause for the development of the aids to enlightenment.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p8 href=#p8>8</a></span>(2) “‘Again, friends, a bhikkhu is virtuous; he dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha, possessed of good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults. Having undertaken the training rules, he trains in them. This is the second proximate cause….</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p9 href=#p9>9</a></span>(3) “‘Again, friends, a bhikkhu gets to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires, on contentment, on solitude, on not getting bound up [with others], on arousing energy, on virtuous behavior, on concentration, on wisdom, on liberation, on the knowledge and vision of liberation. This is the third proximate cause….</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p10 href=#p10>10</a></span>(4) “‘Again, friends, a bhikkhu has aroused energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring wholesome qualities; he is strong, firm in exertion, not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities. This is the fourth proximate cause….</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p11 href=#p11>11</a></span>(5) “‘Again, friends, a bhikkhu is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is the fifth proximate cause for the development of the aids to enlightenment.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p12 href=#p12>12</a></span>“When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will be virtuous, one who dwells restrained by the Pātimokkha … will train in them.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p13 href=#p13>13</a></span>“When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will get to hear at will, without trouble or difficulty, talk concerned with the austere life that is conducive to opening up the heart, that is, talk on fewness of desires … on the knowledge and vision of liberation.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p14 href=#p14>14</a></span>“When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good comrades, it can be expected of him that he will arouse energy [353] for abandoning unwholesome qualities … not casting off the duty of cultivating wholesome qualities.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p15 href=#p15>15</a></span>“When a bhikkhu has good friends, good companions, good <a id="calibre_link-5251"></a>comrades, it can be expected of him that he will be wise, possessing the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p16 href=#p16>16</a></span>“Having based himself on these five things, the bhikkhu should develop further [another] four things. (6) [The perception of] unattractiveness should be developed to abandon lust. (7) Loving-kindness should be developed to abandon ill will. (8) Mindfulness of breathing should be developed to cut off thoughts. (9) The perception of impermanence should be developed to eradicate the conceit ‘I am.’<span class=note><sup id=note1822>1822</sup><q>The conceit “I am” (<em>asmimāna</em>) is more subtle than personal-existence view (<em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>). Both are removed by the perception of non-self, but whereas the stream-enterer eliminates personal-existence view, only the arahant eliminates the conceit “I am.” On this point see SN <a class=seesutta href=SN22.html#s89>22:89</a>, III 130,<small>8</small>–131,<small>31</small>. It seems that personal-the perception of non-self consists in theexistence view has a stronger conceptual underpinning than the conceit “I am,” which is more closely connected to existential need and therefore can be eliminated only at arahantship.</q></span> When one perceives impermanence, the perception of non-self is stabilized.<span class=note><sup id=note1823>1823</sup><q>Mp: “When the characteristic of impermanence is seen, the characteristic of non-self is seen. Among the three characteristics, when one is seen, the other two are also seen. Thus it is said: ‘When one perceives impermanence, the perception of non-self is stabilized.’” Mp-ṭ, commenting on <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN9.html#s3>9:3</a></strong>, says: “<em>One who perceives impermanence</em> (<em>aniccasaññino</em>): one who perceives impermanence by way of the contemplation of impermanence, which occurs thus: ‘All conditioned phenomena are impermanent’ because they cease to be after having existed; because they arise and vanish; because they are fragile; because they are temporary; and because they exclude permanence. <em>The perception of non-self is stabilized</em> (<em>anattasaññā saṇṭhāti</em>): the perception of non-self consists in the contemplation of non-self, which occurs thus: ‘All phenomena are non-self’ because they are coreless; because we have no mastery over them; and because they are alien, void, hollow, and empty. This perception is stabilized, firmly established in the mind.”</q></span> One who perceives non-self eradicates the conceit ‘I am,’ [which is] nibbāna in this very life.”</p>
<h3><a id=s2 href=#m2>2 (2) Support</a><span class=note><sup id=note1824>1824</sup><q>This is another composite nine, arrived at by combining the five means of support with the four reliances.</q></span></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p17 href=#p17>17</a></span>Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “It is said, Bhante: ‘Equipped with supports, equipped with supports.’ In what way is a bhikkhu equipped with supports?”<span class=note><sup id=note1825>1825</sup><q><em>Nissayasampanno</em>. The expression occurs at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN3.html#s20>3:20</a></strong>, but with a different nuance. Mp glosses <em>nissayasampanno</em> here with <em>patiṭṭhāsampanno</em>, “possessed of a foundation,” which suggests it refers to the supporting conditions for attaining arahantship.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p18 href=#p18>18</a></span>(1) “If, bhikkhu, supported by faith, a bhikkhu abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, the unwholesome is indeed abandoned by him. (2) If, supported by a sense of moral shame … (3) … supported by moral dread … (4) … supported by energy … (5) … supported by wisdom, a bhikkhu abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome, that unwholesome is indeed abandoned by him.<span class=note><sup id=note1826>1826</sup><q>These are the five trainee’s powers (<em>sekhabalāni</em>) of <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN5.html#s1>5:1</a>–2</strong>.</q></span> [354] A bhikkhu has abandoned and well abandoned the unwholesome when he has abandoned it by seeing it with noble wisdom.<span class=note><sup id=note1827>1827</sup><q><em>Taṃ hi’ssa bhikkhuno akusalaṃ pahīnaṃ hoti suppahīnaṃ, yaṃsa ariyāya paññāya disvā pahīnaṃ</em>. This statement indicates that whereas the previous four abandonings are tentative and reversible, the abandoning effected by wisdom is permanent and irreversible.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p19 href=#p19>19</a></span>“Basing himself on these five things, that bhikkhu should rely on four things.<span class=note><sup id=note1828>1828</sup><q>These four are found among the six methods of abandoning the <em>āsavas</em> explained at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN6.html#s58>6:58</a></strong>. See, too, MN 2, where they are included among the seven methods of abandoning the <em>āsavas</em>.</q></span> What four? Here, (6) having reflected, a bhikkhu uses some things; (7) having reflected, he patiently endures some things; (8) having reflected, he avoids some things; and (9) having reflected, he dispels some things.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p20 href=#p20>20</a></span>“It is in this way, bhikkhu, that a bhikkhu is equipped with supports.”</p>
<h3><a id=s3 href=#m3>3 (3) Meghiya</a><span class=note><sup id=note1829>1829</sup><q>Still another composite nine, arrived at by combining the five things that lead to the mind’s maturation and the four meditation subjects, with the addition of a narrative framework. The sutta is also found as Ud 4:1, 34–37, with an “inspired utterance” added.</q></span></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p21 href=#p21>21</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Cālikā on Mount Cālikā.<span class=note><sup id=note1830>1830</sup><q>Mp says that Cālikā was the name of a city and nearby was a mountain also called Cālikā. They had built a large monastery there and the Blessed One had been dwelling in the monastery, supported by the city.</q></span> Now on that occasion the <a id="calibre_link-6053"></a>Venerable Meghiya was the Blessed One’s attendant. Then the Venerable Meghiya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: “Bhante, I would like to enter Jantugāma for alms.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p22 href=#p22>22</a></span>“You may do so, Meghiya, at your own convenience.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p23 href=#p23>23</a></span>Then, in the morning, the Venerable Meghiya dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Jantugāma for alms. When he had walked for alms in Jantugāma, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he went to the bank of the Kimikālā River. As he was walking and wandering around for exercise along the bank of the Kimikālā River, the Venerable Meghiya saw [355] a lovely and delightful mango grove. It occurred to him: “This mango grove is truly lovely and delightful, suitable for the striving of a clansman intent on striving. If the Blessed One permits me, I will come back to this mango grove to strive.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p24 href=#p24>24</a></span>Then the Venerable Meghiya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “This morning, Bhante, I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and entered Jantugāma for alms…. [All as above, but in the first person.] … I thought: ‘This mango grove is truly lovely and delightful, suitable for the striving of a clansman intent on striving. If the Blessed One permits me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive.’ So if the Blessed One would permit me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p25 href=#p25>25</a></span>“As we are alone, Meghiya, wait until another bhikkhu comes along.”<span class=note><sup id=note1831>1831</sup><q>Reading with Ce and Be <em>āgacchati</em>, as against Ee <em>dissatu</em>, “let be seen.”</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p26 href=#p26>26</a></span>A second time the Venerable Meghiya said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, for the Blessed One there is nothing further to be done and no [need to] increase what has been done.<span class=note><sup id=note1832>1832</sup><q>Actually, what occurs “a second time” is only the request for permission, not the full statement. Mp: “<em>There is nothing further to be done</em> (<em>natthi kiñci uttariṃ karaṇīyaṃ</em>): because the four functions have been done respecting the four truths. <em>And no</em> [<em>need</em>] <em>to increase what has been done</em> (<em>katassa vā paṭicayo</em>): no repetition of what he has attained. For the path already developed is not developed again, and there is no repeated abandoning of abandoned defilements.”</q></span> But, Bhante, I have something further to be done and [need to] increase what has been done. If the Blessed One would permit me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p27 href=#p27>27</a></span>“As we are alone, Meghiya, wait until another bhikkhu comes along.” [356]</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p28 href=#p28>28</a></span>A third time the Venerable Meghiya said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, for the Blessed One there is nothing further to be done and no [need to] increase what has been done. But, Bhante, I have something further to be done and [need to] increase what has been done. If the Blessed One would permit me, I will go back to that mango grove to strive.”</p>
<p id="calibre_link-5603" class="calibre21">“Since you speak of striving, Meghiya, what can I say to you? You may go at your own convenience.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p29 href=#p29>29</a></span>Then the Venerable Meghiya rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and went to the mango grove. He entered and sat down at the foot of a tree to pass the day. Then, while the Venerable Meghiya was dwelling in that mango grove, three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts frequently occurred to him: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. It then occurred to him: “This is truly astounding and amazing! I have gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, yet I am still stalked by these three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming.”<span class=note><sup id=note1833>1833</sup><q>Mp: “In five hundred successive lives he had been a king. There had been a stone slab there where he used to sit. He had come accompanied by three troops of dancing girls to amuse himself in the park. From the time Meghiya sat down there, it seemed as if he were no longer a monk but a king sitting on a regal couch beneath a white parasol, surrounded by his retinue of dancing girls. As he enjoyed his splendor, sensual thoughts arose in him. Just then, he seemed to see two thieves who had been arrested by his men and brought before him. In ordering one to be executed, thoughts of ill will arose in him; and in ordering the other to be imprisoned, thoughts of harming arose. Thus he was enveloped by those unwholesome thoughts like a tree by creepers, or like a honey-eater by honey bees.”</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p30 href=#p30>30</a></span>Then the Venerable Meghiya approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Here, Bhante, while I was dwelling in that mango grove, three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts frequently occurred to me: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. It then occurred to me: ‘This is truly astounding and amazing! I have gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness, yet [357] I am still stalked by these three kinds of bad unwholesome thoughts: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming.’”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p31 href=#p31>31</a></span>“Meghiya, when liberation of mind has not matured, five things lead to its maturation.<span class=note><sup id=note1834>1834</sup><q>Mp: “<em>Liberation of mind</em> (<em>cetovimutti</em>): liberation of mind from defilements. In the preliminary phase of practice, the mind is liberated from defilements by way of [liberation in] a particular respect (<em>tadaṅgavasena</em>) and by way of suppression (<em>vikkhambhanavasena</em>). In the subsequent phase, it is liberated by way of eradication (<em>samucchedavasena</em>) and by way of tranquilization (<em>paṭipassaddhivasena</em>). When the dispositions have been awakened and matured, insight gives rise to the path, and as insight reaches maturity, liberation of mind is said to have matured.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p42 href=#p42>42</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the Venerable Nandaka was instructing, encouraging, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the assembly hall. He stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end. When he knew that the talk was finished, he cleared his throat [359] and tapped on the bolt. The bhikkhus opened the door for him. The Blessed One then entered the assembly hall, sat down on the seat that was prepared for him, and said to the Venerable Nandaka: “You gave the bhikkhus a long exposition of the Dhamma. My back was aching while I stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p43 href=#p43>43</a></span>When this was said, the Venerable Nandaka, feeling embarrassed, said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, I did not know that the Blessed One was standing outside the door. If I had known, I wouldn’t have spoken so long.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p44 href=#p44>44</a></span>Then the Blessed One, having understood the Venerable Nandaka’s embarrassment, said to him: “Good, good, Nandaka! It is proper for clansmen like you who have gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness to sit together for the sake of a Dhamma talk. When you assemble, Nandaka, you should do one of two things: either talk on the Dhamma or maintain noble silence.</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p49 href=#p49>49</a></span>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling. Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, the Venerable Nandaka addressed the bhikkhus: “Just now, friends, before he rose from his seat and entered his dwelling, the Blessed One revealed the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life in four terms: [361] ‘Nandaka, a bhikkhu may be endowed with faith but not virtuous….

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p57 href=#p57>57</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these four powers. What four? The power of wisdom, the power of energy, the power of blamelessness, and the power of sustaining a favorable relationship.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p58 href=#p58>58</a></span>(1) “And what, bhikkhus, is the power of wisdom? One has clearly seen and explored with wisdom those qualities that are unwholesome and reckoned as unwholesome; those that are wholesome and reckoned as wholesome; those that are blamable and reckoned as blamable; those that are blameless and reckoned as blameless; those that are dark and reckoned as dark; those that are bright and reckoned as bright; those that should not be cultivated and are reckoned as not to be cultivated; those that should be cultivated and are reckoned as to be cultivated; those that are unworthy of the noble ones and reckoned as unworthy of the noble ones; those that are worthy of the noble ones and reckoned as worthy of the noble ones. This is called the power of wisdom.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p59 href=#p59>59</a></span>(2) “And what is the power of energy? One generates desire to abandon those qualities that are unwholesome and reckoned as unwholesome; those that are blamable and reckoned as blamable; those that are dark and reckoned as dark; those that should not be cultivated and are reckoned as not to be cultivated; those that are unworthy of the noble ones and reckoned as unworthy of the noble ones.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p60 href=#p60>60</a></span>(3) “And what is the power of blamelessness? Here, a noble disciple engages in blameless bodily, verbal, and mental action. This is called the power of blamelessness.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p61 href=#p61>61</a></span>(4) “And what is the power of sustaining a favorable relationship? There are these four means of sustaining a favorable relationship: giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality. Among gifts, the best is the gift of the Dhamma. Among types of endearing speech, the best is repeatedly teaching the Dhamma to one who is interested in it and listens with eager ears. Among types of beneficent conduct, the best is when one encourages, settles, and establishes a person without faith in the accomplishment of faith, an immoral person in the accomplishment of virtuous behavior, a miserly person in the accomplishment of generosity, and an unwise person in the accomplishment of wisdom. Among types of impartiality, the best is that a stream-enterer is equal to a stream-enterer, a once-returner is equal to a once-returner, a non-returner is equal to a non-returner, and an arahant is equal to an arahant.<span class=note><sup id=note1843>1843</sup><q>The explanation of “impartiality” given here may be puzzling. S<em>amānattatā</em> is a compound of “equal” (<em>samāna</em>) and “oneself” (<em>attan</em>). As applied to conduct, it means treating others as one would have them treat oneself, without bias or partiality.

(5) Fear of [loss of] livelihood, (6) fear of disrepute, (7) fear of timidity in assemblies, [365] (8) fear of death, and (9) fear of a bad destination. The noble disciple reflects thus: ‘I am not afraid on account of my livelihood. Why should I be afraid on account of my livelihood? I have the four powers: the power of wisdom, the power of energy, the power of blamelessness, and the power of sustaining a favorable relationship. An unwise person might be afraid on account of his livelihood; a lazy person might be afraid on account of his livelihood; a person who engages in blamable bodily, verbal, and mental action might be afraid on account of his livelihood; a person who does not sustain favorable relationships might be afraid on account of his livelihood.</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p66 href=#p66>66</a></span>“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p67 href=#p67>67</a></span>“Friends, persons should be understood to be twofold: those to be associated with and those not to be associated with.<span class=note><sup id=note1844>1844</sup><q>Although the text puts the subject in the singular, I have used the plural, which sounds more natural in English.

The verb <em>sevati</em>, on which the participle is based, has a wide range of meanings and can support all these renderings.</q></span> Robes, too, should be understood to be twofold: those to be used and those not to be used.

One should not continue to follow him.<span class=note><sup id=note1846>1846</sup><q>I prefer Ee, which does not include <em>saṅkhā pi</em>, “having reflected,” in the first alternative. Ce and Be both include <em>saṅkhā pi</em> in the first three sections. It seems, however, that reflection only becomes pertinent when there is tension between advantages and disadvantages, as in the second and third alternatives. Since the first alternative poses both material and spiritual disadvantages to staying, the proper choice is immediately evident and does not require reflection. MN 17, I 104–8, which is partly parallel to this sutta, provides a check on the readings. MN 17.3 (in Ce, Be, and Ee readings; Ee at I 105,<small>8–10</small>) supports the absence of <em>saṅkhā pi</em> in Ee text of AN.</q></span></p>

It would be proper for the bhikkhu to take leave of the person on whom he has been relying—his preceptor or teacher—since the person has at least been kind enough to provide for his material needs. Further, the omission here of the words <em>rattibhāgaṃ vā divasabhāgaṃ vā</em>, “any time night or day,” suggests there must also be a difference in the manner of departing.</q></span> One should not continue to follow him.</p>

In his translation of Vism, where the word is used in a technical sense, Ñāṇamoli renders it “change-of-lineage” (see Vism 672–75, Ppn 22.1–14). Mp explains this person—in accordance with the exegetical scheme of the commentaries—as “one with a mind of powerful insight that has reached the peak, the immediate condition for the path of stream-entry.” Mp is here referring to the <em>gotrabhū</em> mind-moment in the cognitive process (<em>cittavīthi</em>) of the path, the mental event that immediately precedes <em>sotāpattimaggacitta</em>, the mind-moment of the path of stream-entry. Since this scheme is relatively late and presupposes the Abhidhamma theory of the cognitive process, it is unlikely to reveal the original meaning of <em>gotrabhū</em>. In the Nikāyas, the word occurs infrequently. In the present sutta it seems to mean simply a virtuous monk or nun who has not reached the path of stream-entry. We find the plural form at MN 142.8, III 255,<small>6–7</small>: “But in the future, Ānanda, there will be clan members, with ochre [robes around] their necks, immoral people, of bad character” (<em>bhavissanti kho pan’ānanda, anāgatamaddhānaṃ gotrabhuno kāsāvakaṇṭhā dussīlā pāpadhammā</em>). In the latter passage it has a pejorative sense, referring to those who show merely the outer marks of a monastic without worthy inner qualities.</q></span> These nine persons are worthy of gifts … an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”</p>

<h3><a id=s11 href=#m11>11 (1) Lion’s Roar</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p86 href=#p86>86</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p87 href=#p87>87</a></span>“Bhante, I have completed the rains residence at Sāvatthī. I want to depart on a tour of the countryside.”</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p89 href=#p89>89</a></span>Then the Venerable Sāriputta rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. [374] Then, not long after the Venerable Sāriputta had left, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, the Venerable Sāriputta struck me and then set out on tour without apologizing.”<span class=note><sup id=note1851>1851</sup><q>Mp glosses <em>āsajja</em> with <em>ghaṭṭetvā</em>, implying physical violence, and <em>appaṭinissajja</em> with <em>akkhamāpetvā</em>, “without asking pardon.” Mp continues: “Why did he bear resentment [against Sāriputta]? It is said that after the elder had paid homage to the Buddha, the edge of his robe hit the monk’s body as he was walking away…. Because of this the monk became resentful, so when he saw the elder leaving with a large retinue, out of envy he thought to obstruct his journey; thus he spoke as he did.”</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p90 href=#p90>90</a></span>Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: “Go, <a id="calibre_link-5833"></a>bhikkhu, in my name call Sāriputta, [telling him]: ‘The Teacher is calling you, friend Sāriputta.’’’<span class=note><sup id=note1852>1852</sup><q>Mp explains that if the Buddha had tried to exonerate Sāriputta, the bhikkhu would have thought that the Teacher was taking the side of his chief disciple and not the side of a junior monk; thus he would have harbored hatred against the Buddha, too. By calling Sāriputta and asking him about the matter, the Buddha will get Sāriputta to exonerate himself.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p91 href=#p91>91</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” that bhikkhu replied. Then he approached the Venerable Sāriputta and said: “The Teacher is calling you, friend Sāriputta.’’</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p94 href=#p94>94</a></span>Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p105 href=#p105>105</a></span>Then that [accusing] bhikkhu rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed One’s feet, and said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, I have committed a transgression in that I so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully slandered the Venerable Sāriputta on grounds that are untrue, baseless, and false.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p106 href=#p106>106</a></span>“Surely, bhikkhu, you have committed a transgression in that you so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully slandered the Venerable Sāriputta on grounds that are untrue, baseless, and false. But since you see your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept it. For it is growth in the Noble One’s discipline that one sees one’s transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes future restraint.” [378]</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p107 href=#p107>107</a></span>The Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: “Sāriputta, pardon this hollow man before his head splits into seven pieces right there.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p108 href=#p108>108</a></span>“I will pardon this venerable one, Bhante, if this venerable one says to me: ‘And let the venerable one pardon me.’”<span class=note><sup id=note1853>1853</sup><q><em>Khamāmahaṃ bhante tassa āyasmato sace maṃ so āyasmā evam āha “khamatu ca me so āyasmā” ti</em>. As I understand this sentence, Sāriputta is simply saying that he will pardon the accusing bhikkhu if the latter asks him for pardon. Mp, however, explains this sentence otherwise: “The elder [Sāriputta], having pardoned the monk for his transgression, apologizes to him before the Buddha.” This explanation, it seems, has influenced the translation in <em>Gradual Sayings</em>: “Lord, I do pardon that venerable one, if he speak thus to me; and let him, too, pardon me” (<a class=seesutta href=AN4.html#s252>4:252</a>). It is also reflected in NDB 233: “I shall forgive him, Lord, if this revered monk asks for my pardon. And he, too, may forgive me.” The text itself, however, says nothing about Sāriputta offering an apology to his accuser, since he has done nothing that calls for an apology. Sāriputta is not himself addressing these words to the monk; he is saying that the monk should address these words <em>to him</em> in order to obtain pardon. In other words, so far the monk has apologized only to the Buddha, not to Sāriputta. On principle, Sāriputta can only pardon the monk if the latter asks for pardon. The word <em>ca</em>, “and,” occurs in the sentence to be spoken by the monk, presumably, to mean “in addition to the Buddha, let Sāriputta also pardon me.”</q></span></p>
<h3><a id=s12 href=#m12>12 (2) With Residue Remaining</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p109 href=#p109>109</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī at Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Sāriputta dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. It then occurred to him: “It is still too early to walk for alms in Sāvatthī.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p190 href=#p190>190</a></span>“Alms are given in my family, Bhante, but they consist of broken rice accompanied by rice gruel.”<span class=note><sup id=note1876>1876</sup><q>Mp: “The Blessed One does not ask this with reference to alms given to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. For in Anāthapiṇḍika’s home excellent almsfood was constantly given to the bhikkhus. But the alms being given to the multitude was coarse, which did not please Anāthapiṇḍika. So the Buddha asks with that intention.” Mp’s explanation sounds contrived, for the expressions the Buddha uses in his response suggest that alms to renunciants were intended. It is possible this sutta was spoken at a time when Anāthapiṇḍika’s finances were low. Alternatively, given its legendary character, the sutta may be in part a literary fiction composed for a didactic purpose. A Chinese parallel, MĀ 155, has virtually the same exchange as the Pāli at T I 677a<small>12–13</small>. In another Chinese parallel, EĀ 27.3, Anāthapiṇḍika says (at T II 644b<small>22</small>): “My poor family always practices giving, but the food is coarse and we don’t always give the same” (<img src="images/000033.jpg" class="calibre121">).</q></span></p>

Enmity is twofold, external and internal. For if one has killed someone’s father, the other thinks: ‘They say he killed my father; I will kill him.’ So the latter takes a sharp knife and pursues the former. The volition arisen in him is called the external enmity [in relation to the future victim]. But the other hears, ‘He’s coming to kill me’ and decides: ‘I’ll kill him first.’ This is called the internal enmity [in relation to himself]. They both pertain to this present life. When the warden of hell sees the murderer reborn in hell, the volition arises in him: ‘I’ll take a blazing iron hammer and strike him’: this is the external enmity pertaining to the future life. And the volition that arises in the victim, ‘He’s coming to strike me though I’m faultless; I’ll strike him first,’ is the internal enmity pertaining to the future life. The external enmity is what is called ‘enmity as a person’ in the [old] Commentary.”</q></span> and he also experiences mental pain and dejection.

When a forest-dwelling bull elephant is heading for its feeding ground, and other elephants—males, females, young ones, and babies—eat the bent and twisted bundle of branches, the bull elephant is repelled, humiliated, and disgusted with this. When a forest-dwelling bull elephant has entered the pool and other elephants—males, females, young ones, and babies—precede him and stir up the water with their trunks, the bull elephant is repelled, humiliated, and disgusted with this. When a forest-dwelling bull elephant has emerged from the pool and female elephants go by brushing against his body, the forest-dwelling bull elephant is repelled, humiliated, and disgusted with this.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p337 href=#p337>337</a></span>“On that occasion it occurs to the forest-dwelling bull elephant: ‘I am presently dwelling hemmed in by other elephants: males, females, young ones, and babies.

He then eats grass without the tops broken off; they do not eat his bent and twisted [436] bundle of branches; he drinks clear water; and when he has come out from the pool, the female elephants do not go by brushing against his body. On that occasion it occurs to the forest-dwelling bull elephant: ‘In the past I dwelled hemmed in by other elephants … and when I came out from the pool, the female elephants went by brushing against my body. But now I dwell alone, withdrawn from the herd. I eat grass without the tops broken off; they do not eat my bent and twisted bundle of branches; I drink clear water; and when I have come out from the pool, the female elephants do not go by brushing against my body.’ Having broken off a bundle of branches with his trunk, having rubbed his body with it, he happily relieves his itches.</p>

When he had walked for alms in Uruvelakappa, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “You stay right here, Ānanda, while I enter the Great Wood to pass the day.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p345 href=#p345>345</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied. Then the Blessed One entered the Great Wood and sat down to pass the day at the foot of a tree.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p346 href=#p346>346</a></span>Then the householder Tapussa approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
