<h3><a id=s1 href=#m1>1 (1) Worthy of Gifts (1)</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1 href=#p1>1</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p2 href=#p2>2</a></span>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p3 href=#p3>3</a></span>“Bhikkhus, possessing six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What six? (1) Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending.<span class=note><sup id=note1251>1251</sup><q><em>N’eva sumano hoti na dummano, upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno.</em> Mp: “<em>Neither joyful nor saddened</em>: [filled] with joy accompanied by lust in regard to a desirable object. <em>Nor</em> [<em>is he</em>] <em>saddened</em>: [filled] with sadness accompanied by aversion in regard to an undesirable object. <em>But</em> [<em>he</em>] <em>dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending</em>: He is not equanimous because he has fallen into the ‘equanimity of unknowing’ (<em>aññāṇ’upekkhā</em>) through apathy in the case of a neutral object; but rather, being mindful and clearly comprehending, he maintains neutrality in relation to the object. In this sutta, the constant dwelling of an arahant is discussed.”</q></span> (2) Having heard a sound with the ear, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. (3) Having smelled an odor with the nose, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. (4) Having experienced a taste with the tongue, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. (5) Having felt a tactile object with the body, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending. (6) Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu is neither joyful nor saddened, but dwells equanimous, mindful, and clearly <a id="calibre_link-5461"></a>comprehending. Possessing these six qualities, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p4 href=#p4>4</a></span>This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement. [280]</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p6 href=#p6>6</a></span>(1) “Here, a bhikkhu wields the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p7 href=#p7>7</a></span>(2) “With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p8 href=#p8>8</a></span>(3) “He understands the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with his own mind. He understands a mind with lust as a mind with lust and a mind without lust as a mind without lust; a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred and a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred; a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion; a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; a surpassable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable; a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p9 href=#p9>9</a></span>(4) “He recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty [281] births, a hundred <a id="calibre_link-5487"></a>births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.’ Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p10 href=#p10>10</a></span>(5) “With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: ‘These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p26 href=#p26>26</a></span>(1) “Here, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata thus: ‘The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Tathāgata. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, <a id="calibre_link-5924"></a>gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population,<span class=note><sup id=note1258>1258</sup><q><em>Visamagatāya pajāya samappatto</em>. Mp: “Among beings who have become unbalanced (<em>visamagatesu</em>) through lust, hatred, and delusion, he has attained peace and calmness (<em>samaṃ upasamaṃ patto hutv</em>ā).” From this, it is obvious that Mp takes Pāli <em>sama</em> to be equivalent to Skt <em>śama</em>, peace. But since the text establishes a contrast between <em>visama</em>, the imbalance (or unrighteousness) in which ordinary people live, and the <em>sama</em> that the noble disciple has attained, it is more likely that Pāli <em>sama</em> corresponds to Skt <em>sama</em>. Two Chinese parallels support this supposition. SĀ² 156, at T II 432c<small>15–16</small>, has <img src="images/000097.jpg" class="calibre93"> (“Whether his enemies or his relatives, toward these two types of people he has no thought of hostility but his mind is balanced”).

As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma,<span class=note><sup id=note1259>1259</sup><q><em>Dhammasotaṃ samāpanno</em>. Mp: “He has entered the stream of the Dhamma consisting in insight.” Since the Pāli expression can easily be contracted to <em>sotāpanna</em>, I do not see why Mp interprets <em>dhammasota</em> as insight (<em>vipassanā</em>) rather than the noble path (<em>ariyamagga</em>). In SN <a class=seesutta href=SN55.html#s5>55:5</a>, at V 347,<small>24–25</small>, <em>sota</em> is used as a metaphor for the noble eightfold path.</q></span> he develops recollection of the Buddha.</p>

A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p158 href=#p158>158</a></span>(1) “Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata thus: ‘The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight.

Having made this a basis,<span class=note><sup id=note1293>1293</sup><q><em>Idampi kho bhikkhave ārammaṇaṃ karitvā</em>. In the Nikāyas the word <em>ārammaṇa</em> does not yet mean “object of consciousness” in the general sense, as it does in the Abhidhamma and commentaries. Occasionally in the Nikāyas <em>ārammaṇa</em> may signify an object of meditation, but this role is usually taken by <em>nimitta</em>, which does not necessarily mean the “counterpart sign” as it does in the commentaries. I do not interpret the present text to be saying that one takes the recollection of the Buddha <em>as an object</em>, but that one <em>makes it a basis</em>, or starting point, for departing from greed. For this, I draw support from Mp-ṭ, which glosses <em>ārammaṇaṃ karitvā</em> thus: “Having made it a condition, having made it a foundation” (<em>paccayaṃ karitvā pādakaṃ katvā</em>). Mp-ṭ takes “this” (<em>idam</em>) in the lemma above to be the access concentration (<em>upacārajjhāna</em>) obtained by recollection of the Buddha. Mp explains “are purified” (<em>visujjhanti</em>) to mean “they attain final nibbāna, the supreme purity.”</q></span> some beings here are purified in such a way.</p>

<h3><a id=s28 href=#m28>28 (8) Occasion (2)</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p186 href=#p186>186</a></span>On one occasion a number of elder bhikkhus were dwelling at Bārāṇasī in the deer park at Isipatana. Then, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, those elder bhikkhus assembled and were sitting together in the pavilion hall when this conversation arose among them: “What, friends, is the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p187 href=#p187>187</a></span>When this was said, one bhikkhu told those elders: “Friends, after his meal, when an esteemed bhikkhu has returned from his alms round, washed his feet, and is sitting with his legs crossed, holding his body straight, having established mindfulness before him: that is the proper occasion for going to see him.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p188 href=#p188>188</a></span>When he had spoken, another bhikkhu told him: “Friend, that isn’t the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu. After his meal, when an esteemed bhikkhu has returned from his alms round, washed his feet, and is sitting with his legs crossed, holding his body straight, having established mindfulness before him, his fatigue on account of his walking [for alms] and his meal has not yet subsided. Therefore that is not the proper occasion for going to see him. But in the evening, when an esteemed bhikkhu has emerged from seclusion and is sitting in the shade of his dwelling with his legs crossed, holding his body straight, having established mindfulness before him: that is the proper occasion for going to see him.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p189 href=#p189>189</a></span>When he had spoken, another bhikkhu told him: “Friend, that isn’t the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p190 href=#p190>190</a></span>When he had spoken, another bhikkhu told him: “Friend, that isn’t the proper occasion for going to see an esteemed bhikkhu.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p191 href=#p191>191</a></span>When this was said, the Venerable Mahākaccāna said to those elder bhikkhus: “Friends, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard and learned this:</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p195 href=#p195>195</a></span>When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī was silent.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p196 href=#p196>196</a></span>Then the Venerable Ānanda said to the Venerable Udāyī: “The Teacher is addressing you, friend Udāyī.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p197 href=#p197>197</a></span>“I heard him, friend Ānanda. [323]</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p199 href=#p199>199</a></span>Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “I knew, Ānanda, that this hollow man Udāyī does not devote himself to the higher mind.<span class=note><sup id=note1299>1299</sup><q><em>Adhicittaṃ</em>.

With the fading away as well of rapture, he dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ This subject of recollection, developed and cultivated in this way, leads to a happy dwelling in this very life.<span class=note><sup id=note1300>1300</sup><q>Ironically, this may be the only place in the Nikāyas where three jhānas are referred to as an <em>anussatiṭṭhāna</em>, “subject of recollection.” Neither text nor Mp offers an explanation why the fourth jhāna is set off as a separate subject of recollection, the fifth here. In fact, the use of the designation <em>anussatiṭṭhāna</em> for the five contemplations mentioned by Ānanda, and the sixth added by the Buddha, seems unique to this sutta.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p202 href=#p202>202</a></span>(2) “Again, Bhante, a bhikkhu attends to the perception of light; he focuses on the perception of day thus: ‘As by day, so at night; as at night, so by day.’ Thus, with a mind that is open and uncovered, he develops a mind imbued with luminosity.<span class=note><sup id=note1301>1301</sup><q><em>Yathā divā tathā rattiṃ, yathā rattiṃ tathā divā</em>.

As at night he attends to the perception of light, just so does he attend to it during the day. <em>Obtaining knowledge and vision</em>: this is obtaining the divine eye, called knowledge and vision.”</q></span> This subject of recollection, developed and cultivated in this way, leads to obtaining knowledge and vision.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p203 href=#p203>203</a></span>(3) “Again, Bhante, a bhikkhu reviews this very body upward from the soles of the feet, downward from the tips of the hairs, enclosed in skin, as full of many kinds of impurities: ‘There are in this body head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, <a id="calibre_link-5155"></a>lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, fluid of the joints, urine.’ This subject of recollection, developed and cultivated in this way, leads to abandoning sensual lust.</p>

He compares his own body with it thus: ‘This body, too, is of the same nature; it will be like that; it is not beyond that.’ Or suppose he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel ground, bones bleached white, the color of shells … bones heaped up, more than a year old … bones rotted, crumbled to dust. He compares his own body with it thus: [325] ‘This body, too, is of the same nature; it will be like that; it is not beyond that.’ This subject of recollection, developed and cultivated in this way, leads to the uprooting of the conceit ‘I am.’</p>

There too they <a id="calibre_link-5395"></a>knew him as “the brahmā Tissa, powerful and mighty.” Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that brahmā world. When he saw the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna coming in the distance, the brahmā Tissa said to him:</p>

Sit down, respected Moggallāna. This seat has been prepared.” The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the prepared seat. The brahmā Tissa paid homage to him and sat down to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna then said to him:</p>

<h3><a id=s37 href=#m37>37 (7) Giving</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p245 href=#p245>245</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the female lay follower Veḷukaṇṭakī Nandamātā had prepared an offering possessed of six factors for the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Blessed One saw the female lay follower Veḷukaṇṭakī Nandamātā preparing this offering and he then addressed the bhikkhus:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p246 href=#p246>246</a></span>“Bhikkhus, the female lay follower Veḷukaṇṭakī Nandamātā is preparing an offering possessed of six factors for the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.

It is not easy to measure the merit of such an offering thus: ‘Just so much is the stream of merit, stream of the wholesome, nutriment of happiness—heavenly, ripening in happiness, conducive to heaven—that leads to what is wished for, desired, and agreeable, to one’s welfare and happiness’; rather, it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit. Bhikkhus, just as it is not easy to measure the water in the great ocean [337] thus: ‘There are so many gallons of water,’ or ‘There are so many hundreds of gallons of water,’ or ‘There are so many thousands of gallons of water,’ or ‘There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water,’ but rather it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water; so too, it is not easy to measure the merit of such an offering … rather, it is reckoned simply as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit.”</p>

Having realized by his own direct knowledge the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.”</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p314 href=#p314>314</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. When he had walked for alms in Sāvatthī, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Come, Ānanda, let us go to Migāramātā’s Mansion in the Eastern Park [345] to pass the day.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p315 href=#p315>315</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p316 href=#p316>316</a></span>Then the Blessed One, together with the Venerable Ānanda, went to Migāramātā’s Mansion in the Eastern Park.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p317 href=#p317>317</a></span>Then in the evening the Blessed One emerged from seclusion <a id="calibre_link-5174"></a>and addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Come, Ānanda, let us go to the eastern gate to bathe.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p318 href=#p318>318</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p319 href=#p319>319</a></span>Then the Blessed One, together with the Venerable Ānanda, went to the eastern gate to bathe. Having bathed at the eastern gate and come out, he stood in one robe drying himself. On that occasion, King Pasenadi of Kosala’s bull elephant<span class=note><sup id=note1316>1316</sup><q>The various applications of the word <em>nāga</em> will be explained just below. King’s Pasenadi’s bull elephant was called “Seta” (“White”) because its body was white.</q></span> named “Seta” was coming out through the eastern gate to the accompaniment of instrumental music and drumming. People saw him and said: “The king’s bull elephant is handsome! The king’s bull elephant is beautiful! The king’s bull elephant is graceful! The king’s bull elephant is massive! He’s a nāga, truly a nāga.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p320 href=#p320>320</a></span>When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, is it only when people see an elephant possessed of a large massive body that they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ or do people also say this when they see [other] things possessed of a large massive body?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p321 href=#p321>321</a></span>“(1) Udāyī, when people see an elephant possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (2) When people see a horse possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (3) When people see a bull possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (4) When people see a serpent possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (5) When people see a tree [346] possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (6) When people see a human being possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ But, Udāyī, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I call one a nāga who does no evil by body, speech, and mind.”<span class=note><sup id=note1317>1317</sup><q>A pun is intended here. The Buddha’s statement—<em>āguṃ na karoti</em>—playfully derives the word <em>nāga</em> from <em>na</em> + <em>āguṃ</em>, “no evil.” <em>Nāga</em> thus becomes an epithet for the Buddha, or, more broadly, for any arahant. See Sn 527: <em>Āguṃ na karoti kiñci loke</em> … <em>nāgo tādi pavuccate tathattā</em> (“One who does no evil in the world …the stable one is for such a reason called a nāga”).

However, the same verses at Th 689–704 are ascribed simply to Udāyī, while a different set of verses in Th (527–36) is ascribed to Kāludāyī. This proves that Mp’s identification of the poet cannot be correct.

Apparently Ee’s former reading is a typographical error for the latter, since on the first occurrence <em>saññā</em> is cited as a variant in the notes. Again, the common <em>s</em>/<em>p</em> confusion must lie behind the variants. <em>Ambaka</em> in Ce and Ee (or Be <em>ammaka</em>) is derived from <em>ammā</em>, “mother,” but with the more general meaning of women. Mp-ṭ explains: “<em>Ammakā</em> (or <em>ambakā</em>) means women (lit., the class of mothers). This is a metaphorical term. That is, mothers, the class of mothers, maternal parents, are found among women” (<em>Ammakāti mātugāmo. Upacāravacanañh’etaṃ. Itthīsu yadidaṃ ammakā mātugāmo jananī janikā</em>). SED sv <em>ambā</em> has “a mother, good woman (as a title of respect).” And under <em>ambikā</em>: “mother, good woman (as a term of respect).” The Chinese parallel at T II 258c<small>8–9</small>, does not include the derogatory generalization about women, but states the matter with reference to Migasālā as an individual: “The lay follower Migasālā is foolish and has little wisdom” (<img src="images/000087.jpg" class="calibre103">).</q></span> And who are those [who have] the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior?<span class=note><sup id=note1333>1333</sup><q>The juxtaposition of nominative <em>ke</em> with locative <em>–ñāṇe</em> is puzzling. I take the sense to be that those referred to by <em>ke</em> are established <em>in</em> this knowledge. Perhaps, though, <em>–ñāṇe</em> is a residual eastern form, a nominative plural in agreement with <em>ke</em>. Mp does not attempt to resolve this problem, but when commenting on “in the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior” (<em>purisapuggalaparopariyañāṇe</em>), it explains this knowledge as “the knowledge of other persons’ superior and inferior faculties by way of their sharpness or dullness” (<em>purisapuggalānaṃ tikkhamuduvasena indriyaparopariyañāṇaṃ</em>).</q></span></p>

Now on that occasion the Venerable Khema and the Venerable Sumana were dwelling at Sāvatthī [359] in the Blind Men’s Grove. Then they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Khema then said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p421 href=#p421>421</a></span>“Bhante, when a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, who has lived the spiritual life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached his own goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of existence, one completely liberated through final knowledge, it does not occur to him: (1) ‘There is someone better than me,’ or (2) ‘There is someone equal to me,’ or (3) ‘There is someone inferior to me.’”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p422 href=#p422>422</a></span>This is what the Venerable Khema said. The Teacher agreed.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p425 href=#p425>425</a></span>Then, soon after both monks had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, it is in such a way that clansmen declare final knowledge.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p626 href=#p626>626</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p627 href=#p627>627</a></span>“Contact, bhikkhus, is one [402] end; the arising of contact is the second end; the cessation of contact is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production <a id="calibre_link-5712"></a>of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known; fully understands what should be fully understood; and by doing so, in this very life he makes an end of suffering.”<span class=note><sup id=note1401>1401</sup><q>In a Chinese parallel to this sutta, SĀ 1164 (T II 310b<small>20</small>–311a<small>2</small>), the bhikkhus propose only five interpretations of the verse: (1) six internal bases, six external bases, and feeling; (2) the past, the future, and the present; (3) pleasure, pain, and neither pain nor pleasure; (4) existence, its origin, and feeling; (5) identity and its origin (the middle term is missing). When they inquire from the Buddha, he explains the verse in terms of contact, its origin, and feeling. The verse in the Chinese does not have a word corresponding to Pāli <em>mantā</em>.</q></span></p>
<h3><a id=s62 href=#m62>62 (8) Knowledge</a><span class=note><sup id=note1402>1402</sup><q>Here I follow the <em>uddāna</em> verse of Be. The Ce version is not clear to me.</q></span></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p628 href=#p628>628</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus when he arrived at a Kosalan town named Daṇḍakappaka. Then the Blessed One left the highway and sat down on a seat that was prepared for him at the foot of a tree, and those bhikkhus entered Daṇḍakappaka to search for a rest house.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p629 href=#p629>629</a></span>Then the Venerable Ānanda together with a number of bhikkhus went down to the Aciravatī River to bathe. Having finished bathing and come back out, he stood in one robe drying his body. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Venerable Ānanda and said to him: “Friend Ānanda, was it after full consideration that the Blessed One declared of Devadatta: ‘Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for the eon, unredeemable,’ or did he say this only figuratively?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p630 href=#p630>630</a></span>“It was just in this way, friend, that the Blessed One declared it.”<span class=note><sup id=note1403>1403</sup><q>As at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN6.html#s44>6:44</a></strong>, III 348,<sub>9–10</sub>.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p631 href=#p631>631</a></span>Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and [reported what had happened, ending]: [403] “When this was said, Bhante, I said to that bhikkhu: ‘It was just in this way, friend, that the Blessed One declared it.’”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p632 href=#p632>632</a></span>[The Blessed One said:] “Ānanda, that bhikkhu must be either newly ordained, not long gone forth, or a foolish and incompetent elder.

Possessing these six qualities, the householder Tapussa has reached certainty about the Tathāgata and become a seer of the deathless, one who lives having realized the deathless.”<span class=note><sup id=note1453>1453</sup><q>It is often claimed that this series of suttas testifies to a large number of lay arahants during the Buddha’s time. This, however, is a misunderstanding. For we find on this list Anāthapiṇḍika, Pūraṇa (or Purāṇa), and Isidatta, all of whom were reborn in the Tusita heaven (see <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN6.html#s44>6:44</a></strong> and MN 143.16, III 262,<small>1</small>). We also find Ugga of Vesālī, who is said (at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN5.html#s44>5:44</a></strong>) to have been reborn among the mind-made deities, and Hatthaka, who is said (at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN3.html#s127>3:127</a></strong>) to have been reborn in the Aviha heaven of the pure abodes. The terms used to describe these lay followers are descriptive of <em>all noble ones</em> from stream-enterers on up. They all have unwavering confidence (<em>aveccappasāda</em>) in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha, have “reached certainty about the Tathāgata” (<em>tathāgate niṭṭhaṅgata</em>), and are seers of nibbāna, the deathless (<em>amataddasa</em>). See <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN10.html#s63>10:63</a></strong>, where certainty about the Buddha is ascribed to disciples at levels lower than arahantship. The statement that these people have noble liberation (<em>ariyena vimuttiyā</em>) is unusual, but Mp glosses it “by the liberation of the fruit of trainees” (<em>sekhaphalavimuttiyā</em>). Quite a different formula is used to describe an arahant. In the Nikāyas there are no recorded cases of laypeople who attained arahantship and then continued to lead the lay life. Those who do attain it entered upon the homeless life soon after their attainment, like Yasa at Vin I 17,<small>1–3</small>.</q></span></p>
