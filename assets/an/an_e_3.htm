<h3><a id=s1 href=#m1>1 (1) Peril</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1 href=#p1>1</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p2 href=#p2>2</a></span>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p3 href=#p3>3</a></span>“Bhikkhus, whatever perils arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. Whatever calamities arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. Whatever misfortunes arise all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. Just as a fire that starts in a house made of reeds or grass burns down even a house with a peaked roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with bolts fastened and shutters closed; so too, whatever perils arise … all arise on account of the fool, not on account of the wise person. (1) Thus, bhikkhus, the fool brings peril, the wise person brings no peril; (2) the fool brings calamity, the wise person brings no calamity; (3) the fool brings misfortune, the wise person brings no misfortune. There is no peril from the wise person; there is no calamity from the wise person; there is no misfortune from the wise person.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p4 href=#p4>4</a></span>“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will avoid the three qualities possessing which one is known as a fool, and we will undertake and practice the three qualities <a id="calibre_link-5235"></a>possessing which one is known as a wise person.’ It is in this way that you should train yourselves.” [102]</p>
<h3><a id=s2 href=#m2>2 (2) Characteristics</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p5 href=#p5>5</a></span>“Bhikkhus, the fool is characterized by his actions; the wise person is characterized by his actions.

Mp: “These are the means of recognition.”</q></span> What three? Here, a fool thinks badly, speaks badly, and acts badly. If the fool did not think badly, speak badly, and act badly, how would wise people know of him: ‘This fellow is a fool, a bad person’? But because the fool thinks badly, speaks badly, and acts badly, wise people know of him: ‘This fellow is a fool, a bad person.’ These are the fool’s three characteristics of a fool, marks of a fool, manifestations of a fool.</p>

[103] But because the wise person thinks well, speaks well, and acts well, wise people know of him: ‘This fellow is wise, a good person.’ These are the wise person’s three characteristics of a wise person, marks of a wise person, manifestations of a wise person.</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p82 href=#p82>82</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then the Venerable Saviṭṭha and the Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side. The Venerable Sāriputta then said to the Venerable Saviṭṭha:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p83 href=#p83>83</a></span>“Friend Saviṭṭha, there are these three kinds of persons found existing in the world. What three?

All three classes are <em>sekhas</em> ranging from the stream-enterer through one on the path to arahantship. As general classes, they differ, not in their position relative to the final goal, but in their dominant spiritual faculty. The body witness (<em>kāyasakkhī</em>) gives prominence to concentration and attains the “peaceful formless emancipations.” One attained to view (<em>diṭṭhippatta</em>) gives prominence to wisdom and does not attain the formless emancipations. One liberated by faith (<em>saddhāvimutta</em>) gives prominence to faith and does not attain the formless emancipations. Because these three categories comprise persons standing anywhere from stream-enterer to the path to arahantship, their members cannot be prejudged as superior and inferior merely by falling into a particular class. To make such judgments, one would have to know their standing in terms of the six levels they each comprise. The body witness, on attaining arahantship, becomes “liberated in both respects” (<em>ubhatobhāgavimutta</em>). The other two become “liberated by wisdom” (<em>paññāvimutta</em>). On the two types of arahant, see MN 70.15–16, I 477,<small>24</small>–478,<small>3</small>.</q></span> These are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world.

However, I translate in accordance with the commentarial understanding. While the commentaries may be imposing a later interpretation on more archaic texts that asserted only two ways in which kamma can ripen, as a translator I feel responsible to the text that has been transmitted rather than to theories about a more archaic original. The recognition of a threefold ripening of kamma is not exclusive to the Theravāda school but is also found in the treatises of the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma system. Definitions of the three types—for example, in the Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra at T XXVII 592a<small>22</small>–593b<small>8</small>, and in the Abhidharmakośa at T XXIX 81c<small>10–16</small>—are exactly the same as in the Pāli tradition and thus likely precede the division of the schools.</q></span></p>

For an arahant—who has abandoned greed, hatred, and delusion—kamma created earlier, whether good or bad, is still capable of ripening during the final life. But because there is no more rebirth, with his passing all accumulated kamma from the past becomes defunct. Thus the intention of this statement is not that an arahant’s past kamma cannot ripen while the arahant lives, but that it becomes defunct with the arahant’s passing; for there will be no further continuum of existence within which its fruits might arise. Brahmāli writes: “There must be a distinction here between ‘non-greed’ (<em>alobha</em>) and the situation when ‘greed has vanished’ (<em>lobhe vigata</em>). The former must refer to the motivation behind a particular action, the latter to the full uprooting of greed, attained only by the non-returner or even the arahant.

Although Bucknell (2004) does not list a Chinese parallel of this sutta, by chance I recently discovered a parallel cited in the *Śāriputrābhidharmaśāstra, at T XXVIII 679c<small>22</small>–680a<small>27</small>. While the prose portion there is simpler than that of the Pāli, the two convey essentially the same meaning. Their verses, with the exception of the last, also closely correspond.</q></span></p>

I am immersed in suffering, afflicted by suffering. Perhaps an ending of this entire mass of suffering can be discerned.” [148] As one who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness, it would not be proper for me to seek out sensual pleasures similar to or worse than those that I have discarded.’ He then reflects thus: ‘Energy will be aroused in me without slackening; mindfulness will be established without confusion; my body will be tranquil without disturbance; my mind will be concentrated and one-pointed.’ Having taken himself as his authority, he abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome; he abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless; he maintains himself in purity. This is called oneself as one’s authority.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p247 href=#p247>247</a></span>(2) “And what, bhikkhus, is the world as one’s authority?

But the abode of the world is vast. In the vast abode of the world there are ascetics and brahmins with psychic potency and the divine eye who know the minds of others. They see things from a distance but they are not themselves seen even when they’re close; they know the minds [of others] with their own mind. They would know me thus: “Look at this clansman: though he has gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, he is tarnished by bad unwholesome states.” There are deities, too, with psychic potency and the divine eye who know the minds of others. They see even from a distance but are not seen themselves even when close; they too know the minds [of others] with their own mind. They too would know me thus: “Look at this clansman: though he has gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, he is tarnished by bad unwholesome states.”’ He then reflects thus: ‘Energy will be aroused in me [149] without slackening; mindfulness will be established without confusion; my body will be tranquil without disturbance; my mind will be concentrated and one-pointed.’ Having taken the world as his authority, he abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome; he abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless; he maintains himself in purity.

There are fellow monks of mine who know and see. As one who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness in this well-expounded Dhamma and discipline, it would be improper for me to be lazy and heedless.’ He then reflects thus: ‘Energy will be aroused in me without slackening; mindfulness will be established without confusion; my body will be tranquil without disturbance; my mind will be concentrated and one-pointed.’ Having taken the Dhamma as his authority, he abandons the unwholesome and develops the wholesome; he abandons what is blameworthy and develops what is blameless; he maintains himself in purity.

<p id="calibre_link-6024" class="calibre21">“Master Gotama, we brahmins sacrifice and enjoin others to offer sacrifices. Now both one who himself sacrifices and one who enjoins others to offer sacrifices engage in a meritorious practice that extends to many people, that is, one based on sacrifice.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p362 href=#p362>362</a></span>“Well then, brahmin, I will question you about this matter. You should answer as you see fit. What do you think, brahmin? Here, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, an Enlightened One, a Blessed One. He says thus: ‘Come, this is the path, this is the way. Practicing in accordance with it, I have realized for myself with direct knowledge the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life<span class=note><sup id=note421>421</sup><q><em>Anuttaraṃ brahmacariyogadhaṃ</em>.

In MN 44.29, I 304,<small>21–22</small>, <em>nibbānogadhaṃ</em> is used in conjunction with <em>nibbānaparāyanaṃ</em> and <em>nibbānapariyosānaṃ</em>, which suggests that the three terms are synonymous. It–a I 112,<small>11–12</small>, glosses <em>nibbānogadhagāmī</em> (the same phrase as in AN) with <em>nibbānasaṅkhātaṃ ogadhaṃ patiṭṭhaṃ pāraṃ gacchati</em> (“it goes to the far shore, the support, the culmination consisting in nibbāna”). This explanation, which is consistent with other commentaries, supports my rendering of <em>nibbānogadha</em> here as “culmination in nibbāna” rather than “the plunge into nibbāna,” a rendering used by other translators. My rendering of <em>amatogadha</em> in CDB (as at SN <a class=seesutta href=SN45.html#s139>45:139</a>, <a class=seesutta href=AN46.html#s184>46:184</a>, <a class=seesutta href=AN48.html#s42>48:42</a>, <a class=seesutta href=AN48.html#s44>48:44</a>, etc.) as “with the deathless as its ground” is not satisfactory.

Practicing in accordance with it, you too will realize for yourselves with direct knowledge the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life and dwell in it.’ Thus the teacher teaches this Dhamma and others [169] practice accordingly. There are many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands who do so. What do you think?

Mp explains that the sects (<em>tittha</em>) are the sixty-two views (see DN 1.1.29–3.29, I 12–39); the founders of the sects (<em>titthakara</em>) are those who formulate those views; and the followers of the sects (<em>titthiya</em>) are those who approve of the views.

It is hard to see how this has any relevance to the context.

Brahmāli writes: “The point here seems to be that each of these unwholesome ways of acting is related to particular feelings, and that those feelings (or experiences) can only be experienced through those acts. It follows that if your kamma is such that you have to experience the feelings connected with those bad acts, then you will have to perform them.” The same point, with suitable changes, applies to the following two tenets, that of God’s creative activity and non-causality.

This is the path and way that leads to the abandoning and overcoming of these three perils when mother and son reconnect and of these three perils that separate mother and son.”</p>
<h3><a id=s63 href=#m63>63 (3) Venāga</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p425 href=#p425>425</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan brahmin village named Venāgapura. The brahmin householders of Venāgapura heard: “It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a <a id="calibre_link-6093"></a>Sakyan family, has arrived at Venāgapura. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: ‘That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized by his own direct knowledge this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p426 href=#p426>426</a></span>Then the brahmin householders of Venāgapura approached the Blessed One. Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side; some exchanged greetings with him [181] and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, sat down to one side; some reverentially saluted him and sat down to one side; some pronounced their name and clan and sat down to one side; some kept silent and sat down to one side. The brahmin Vacchagotta of Venāgapura then said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p427 href=#p427>427</a></span>“It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, how Master Gotama’s faculties are tranquil and the color of his skin is pure and bright. Just as a yellow jujube fruit in the autumn is pure and bright, so Master Gotama’s faculties are tranquil and the color of his skin is pure and bright. Just as a palm fruit that has just been removed from its stalk is pure and bright, so Master Gotama’s faculties are tranquil and the color of his skin is pure and bright. Just as an ornament of finest gold, well prepared by a skilled goldsmith and very skillfully wrought in the furnace, placed on red brocade, shines and beams and radiates, so Master Gotama’s faculties are tranquil and the color of his skin is pure and bright.</p>

After the meal, when I have returned from the alms round, I enter a grove. I collect some grass or leaves that I find there into a pile and then sit down. Having folded my legs crosswise and straightened my body, I establish mindfulness in front of me. Then, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I enter and dwell in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, I enter and dwell in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, I dwell equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, I experience pleasure with the body; I enter and dwell in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, I enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.</p>

This <em>seems</em> to imply that walking can occur even with the mind in jhāna. This, however, is contradicted by the dominant understanding that jhāna is a state of uninterrupted absorption in an object, in which case intentional movements like walking would not be possible. Mp-ṭ explains the first case of Mp (walking after entering the jhānas) to mean that he walks back and forth <em>immediately after</em> emerging from the jhāna, while the second case (walking after emerging) to mean that he walks back and forth after having emerged <em>some time earlier</em>.

<h3><a id=s64 href=#m64>64 (4) Sarabha</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p442 href=#p442>442</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now on that occasion a wanderer named Sarabha had recently left this Dhamma and discipline.<span class=note><sup id=note446>446</sup><q>Mp explains that he had been commissioned by the wanderers in his own community to take ordination with the bhikkhus, learn the secret of their success (which they believed to be a kind of magic they used to attract followers), and then return and share it with them. After his ordination he concluded that the Pātimokkha was the key to their success. Having learned the Pātimokkha, he returned to the wanderers and reported that he had learned the Dhamma of the Buddha’s followers. The background story is similar to that of the Susīma Sutta (SN <a class=seesutta href=SN12.html#s70>12:70</a>, II 119–28) but has a different outcome.</q></span> He had been telling an assembly in Rājagaha: “I have learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son. After I learned their Dhamma, I left that Dhamma and discipline.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p443 href=#p443>443</a></span>Then, one morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed, took their bowls and robes, and entered Rājagaha for alms. They then heard the wanderer Sarabha making such a statement to an assembly in Rājagaha. When those bhikkhus had walked for alms in Rājagaha, after their meal, when they returned from their alms round, they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p444 href=#p444>444</a></span>“Bhante, the wanderer Sarabha, who recently left this Dhamma and discipline, has been telling an assembly in Rājagaha: ‘I have learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son. After I learned their Dhamma, I left that Dhamma and discipline.’ It would be good, Bhante, if the Blessed One would go to the wanderers’ park on the bank of the Sappinikā [river] and, out of compassion, approach the wanderer Sarabha.” The Blessed One consented by silence.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p445 href=#p445>445</a></span>Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the wanderers’ park on the bank of the Sappinikā [river]. He approached the wanderer Sarabha, sat down on the seat that was prepared [186] for him, and said to him: “Is it true, Sarabha, that you have been saying: ‘I have learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son. After I learned their Dhamma, I left that Dhamma and discipline’?” When this was said, the wanderer Sarabha was silent.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p446 href=#p446>446</a></span>A second time the Blessed One said to the wanderer Sarabha: “Tell me, Sarabha, how have you learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son? If you have not learned it completely, I will complete it. But if you have learned it completely, I will rejoice.” But a second time the wanderer Sarabha was silent.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p447 href=#p447>447</a></span>A third time the Blessed One said to the wanderer Sarabha:<span class=note><sup id=note447>447</sup><q>Ee has an additional line here: <em>mayā kho Sarabha paññāyati samaṇānaṃ Sakyaputtiyānaṃ dhammo</em>: “Sarabha, the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son has been seen by me.” Be has a variant on this line in parentheses but Ce does not have anything corresponding to it.</q></span> “Tell me, Sarabha, how have you learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son? If you have not learned <a id="calibre_link-5928"></a>it completely, I will complete it. But if you have learned it completely, I will rejoice.” But a third time the wanderer Sarabha was silent.<span class=note><sup id=note448>448</sup><q>At MN 35.13–14, I 231,<small>27–28, 32–35</small>, it is said: “If anyone, when asked a reasonable question up to the third time by the Tathāgata, still does not answer, his head splits into seven pieces then and there.” Here, however, Sarabha fails to answer the Buddha’s question after it has been posed three times, yet his head remains intact and no threat is raised against him.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p448 href=#p448>448</a></span>Then those wanderers said to the wanderer Sarabha: “The ascetic Gotama has offered to give you whatever you might ask him for, friend Sarabha. Speak, friend Sarabha! How have you learned the Dhamma of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan son? If you have not learned it completely, the ascetic Gotama will complete it for you. But if you have learned it completely, he will rejoice.” When this was said, the wanderer Sarabha sat silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p449 href=#p449>449</a></span>Then the Blessed One, having understood that the wanderer Sarabha [sat] silenced, disconcerted, hunched over, downcast, glum, and speechless, said to those wanderers:</p>

Be has only one <em>vā</em>, which leaves the question of the alternatives even more obscure. I have chosen to separate “he would answer evasively…” and “display anger, hatred, and bitterness,” even though we often find the sequence without a disjunction: <em>aññenaññaṃ paṭicarati, bahiddhā kathaṃ apanāmeti, kopañca dosañca appaccayañca pātukaroti</em>. In this respect, I have followed the divisions of the Chinese parallel, SĀ 970, which at T II 250b<small>21–23</small> does offer three distinct alternatives: <img src="images/000017.jpg" class="calibre61">: “He would divert the discussion to an outside subject, or (<img src="images/000092.jpg" class="calibre62">), overcome by anger and conceit, would unreasonably display hostility and impatience, or (<img src="images/000092.jpg" class="calibre62">) would silently harbor shame, his head lowered, privately reflecting.”</q></span></p>

(2) EĀ 46.4 (T II 776c<small>28</small>– 777a<small>2</small>) has <img src="images/000048.jpg" class="calibre64"> (“By this Dharma taught by me the noble ones go out correctly to the complete end of suffering.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p453 href=#p453>453</a></span>Then the Blessed One, having roared his lion’s roar three times in the wanderers’ park on the bank of the Sappinikā [river], rose up into the air and departed.<span class=note><sup id=note452>452</sup><q>Here the Chinese of SĀ 970, at T II 250b<small>28</small>, has simply “he got up from his seat and left” (<img src="images/000049.jpg" class="calibre65">) without a supernormal departure.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p454 href=#p454>454</a></span>Then, soon after the Blessed One had left, those wanderers gave the wanderer Sarabha a thorough verbal lashing,<span class=note><sup id=note453>453</sup><q><em>Vācāya sattitodakena sañjambharim akaṃsu</em>.

I have taken some liberty in rendering the obscure names of these birds in order to bring out the sense. Mp (Ce) glosses <em>ambakamaddari</em> as a small chicken (<em>khuddakakukkuṭikā</em>) and <em>phussaka</em> as a large chicken (<em>mahākukkuṭa</em>). The Chinese parallel, at T II 250c<small>3</small>, has: “Just as a woman might try to make the sound of a man but only makes the sound of a woman” (<img src="images/000059.jpg" class="calibre67">).

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p455 href=#p455>455</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of monks when he reached the town of the Kālāmas named Kesaputta. The Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard: “It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Kesaputta. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: ‘That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened … [as at 3:63] … [and] reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p456 href=#p456>456</a></span>Then the Kālāmas of Kesaputta approached the Blessed One. Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one <a id="calibre_link-5424"></a>side … [as at 3:63] … some kept silent and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Kālāmas said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p457 href=#p457>457</a></span>“Bhante, there are some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesaputta. They explain and elucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others. But then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesaputta, [189] and they too explain and elucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others. We are perplexed and in doubt, Bhante, as to which of these good ascetics speak truth and which speak falsehood.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p458 href=#p458>458</a></span>“It is fitting for you to be perplexed, Kālāmas, fitting for you to be in doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter.<span class=note><sup id=note456>456</sup><q>From the last sentence of the preceding paragraph through this sentence, MĀ 16 reads instead: “Gotama, having heard this, we gave rise to doubt and uncertainty: ‘Of these ascetics or brahmins, which [speak] truthfully and which [speak] falsely?’” The Blessed One said: “Kālāmas, do not give rise to doubt and uncertainty. For what reason? Because when there is doubt and uncertainty, there will arise perplexity. Kālāmas, you yourselves do not have pure wisdom with which to know whether there is an afterlife or not.

Instead, the Buddha immediately explains to the Kālāmas the three unwholesome roots of action and how they lead to moral transgressions. And then he explains the ten courses of wholesome kamma, the explanations being very similar to those found, e.g., at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN10.html#s176>10:176</a></strong> (on the threefold purity) and <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN10.html#s211>10:211</a></strong> (on rebirth in heaven). In MĀ 16, the Buddha does not ask the Kālāmas to judge for themselves but categorically tells them what he himself has known by direct experience. It is possible that MĀ 16 is a normalization of an original Indic text corresponding to the Pāli version, made at a time when the Buddha was widely regarded as an unquestionable authority.</q></span> But when, Kālāmas, you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering,’ then you should abandon them.</p>

(4) A question that should be set aside (<em>ṭhapanīya pañha</em>) is, for example, ‘Is the soul the same as the body?’ This should be set aside without answering it, saying, ‘This has not been declared by the Tathāgata.’” In my opinion, better examples of “a question that should be answered after making a distinction” are the Buddha’s response to Subha at MN 99.4, II 197,<small>9–18</small>; his response to the brahmin Ujjaya at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN4.html#s39>4:39</a></strong>, II 42,<small>14–28</small>; and the householder Vajjiyamāhita’s response to the wanderers at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN10.html#s94>10:94</a></strong>, V 190,<small>14–20</small>.</q></span></p>

It will be noted how, whenever the Nikāyas discuss the Jains, their tone becomes derisive if not acerbic. The compliments, of course, were returned by the Jains.

Thus the Jains are depicted as saying, “It’s only toward beings living far away from you that you should be nonviolent,” as if they were permitted to be violent against those living close by. This, it seems, is contrary to the Jain teaching, which enjoins strict nonviolence (<em>ahiṃsā</em>) in regard to all beings under all conditions.

The purpose of the formula, according to this text, is to instill an attitude of non-possessiveness, one of the basic Jain virtues. The Buddha also taught this formula—which may have been in circulation among various contemplative communities—using it as a means to eliminate “I-making” and “mine-making.” For further discussion of the formula, see <a class=seenote href=AN4.html#note896>AN4, note 896</a>.</q></span> However, his parents know: ‘This is our son.’ And he knows: ‘These are my parents.’ His wife and children know: ‘He is our supporter.’ And he knows: ‘These are my wife and children.’ His slaves, workers, and servants know: ‘He is our master.’ And he knows: ‘These are my slaves, workers, and servants.’ Thus on an occasion when they should be enjoined in truthfulness, [the Nigaṇṭhas] enjoin them in false speech. This, I say, is false speech. When that night has passed, he makes use of possessions that have not been given. This, I say, is taking what has not been given. It is in such a way that the Nigaṇṭhas’ uposatha is observed.

<h3><a id=s74 href=#m74>74 (4) The Nigaṇṭha</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p644 href=#p644>644</a></span>On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then the Licchavi Abhaya and the Licchavi Paṇḍitakumāra approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.<span class=note><sup id=note495>495</sup><q>The Licchavis were the dominant clan in the Vajji republic, which had its capital at Vesālī.</q></span> The Licchavi Abhaya then said to the Venerable Ānanda:</p>

The <em>demolition of the bridge</em> (<em>setughātaṃ</em>) is the demolition of the factor and the demolition of the condition (<em>padaghātaṃ paccayaghātaṃ</em>).” Presumably what is meant is the destruction of kammic accumulations and their condition. SED gives “bond, fetter” as meanings of <em>setu</em>, which seems to fit here.</q></span> [221] Thus, through the destruction of kamma, suffering is destroyed. Through the destruction of suffering, feeling is destroyed. Through the destruction of feeling, all suffering will be worn away. In this way, the overcoming [of suffering] takes place through this directly visible purification by wearing away.<span class=note><sup id=note498>498</sup><q><em>Evam etissā sandiṭṭhikāya nijjarāya visuddhiyā samatikkamo hoti</em>.

The description of the bhikkhu in the first “wearing away” as virtuous, according to Mp, indicates the lower two paths and fruits—those of stream-entry and the once-returner—for disciples at these stages are said to have fulfilled virtuous behavior. The description of the bhikkhu in the second “wearing away,” as one who attains the four jhānas, indicates the attainment of the third path and fruit, that of the non-returner, described as one who has fulfilled concentration. And the description of the bhikkhu in the third “wearing away” as one who has reached the destruction of the taints indicates the fruit of arahantship, since the arahant has fulfilled wisdom. Mp mentions another interpretation, which holds that all three kinds of “wearing away” are descriptions of arahantship, made from the standpoint of the arahant’s virtue, concentration, and wisdom.

<h3><a id=s78 href=#m78>78 (8) Setting Up</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p683 href=#p683>683</a></span>Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One…. The Blessed One then said to him:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p684 href=#p684>684</a></span>“Ānanda, are all behavior and observances, [austere] lifestyles, and spiritual life fruitful when set up as the essence?”<span class=note><sup id=note506>506</sup><q><em>Sīlabbataṃ jīvitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ upaṭṭhānasāraṃ</em>. From the sequence, it is unclear whether <em>upaṭṭhānasāra</em> is one term parallel to the others or a distributive applying to each of the predecessors. Mp glosses as if the latter is the case, that is, as if it meant <em>the setting up</em> of the former three practices, taking them to be the core or essence of spiritual life<em>: Upaṭṭhānena sāraṃ ‘idaṃ varaṃ idaṃ niṭṭhā’ ti evaṃ upaṭṭhitan</em> (“Setting them up as the essence, having set them up [with the conviction] that they are excellent, the goal”). The same sequence of terms is at Ud 6:8, 71,<small>29–32</small>. Ud-a 351,<small>9–17</small>, allows both interpretations: either as a distributive or as one additional type of ascetic practice, perhaps the “carrying out” of certain ascetic practices. Collectively, the three (or four) terms represent the extreme of self-mortification; specific practices are described below at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN3.html#s156>3:156</a> §2</strong> where they are called “the blistering way of practice.” The opposite extreme is the view that there is no harm in sensual pleasures, which corresponds to the sensualist practice described at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN3.html#s156>3:156</a> §1</strong>. The Buddha’s “middle way,” at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN3.html#s156>3:156</a> §3</strong>, avoids the two extremes.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p685 href=#p685>685</a></span>“Not exclusively so, Bhante.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p686 href=#p686>686</a></span>“Well then, Ānanda, distinguish [them].”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p687 href=#p687>687</a></span>“Bhante, suppose one cultivates behavior and observances, an [austere] lifestyle, and a spiritual life, setting them up as if they were the essence. If unwholesome qualities then increase and wholesome qualities decline, such behavior and observances, [austere] lifestyle, and spiritual life, set up as the essence, are fruitless. But if unwholesome qualities decline and wholesome qualities increase, then such behavior and observances, [austere] lifestyle, and spiritual life, set up as the essence, are fruitful.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p688 href=#p688>688</a></span>This is what the Venerable Ānanda said. The Teacher agreed. Then the Venerable Ānanda, thinking, “The Teacher has agreed,” paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and left.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p689 href=#p689>689</a></span>Then, not long after the Venerable Ānanda had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, Ānanda is a trainee, but it is not easy to find one equal to him in wisdom.”</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p701 href=#p701>701</a></span>A second time the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, in the presence of the Blessed One I heard this…. How far, Bhante, can the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One convey his voice?”</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p705 href=#p705>705</a></span>“It is the time for this, Blessed One. It is the time for this, Fortunate One. The Blessed One should speak. Having heard this from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind.”</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p707 href=#p707>707</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” the Venerable Ānanda replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p708 href=#p708>708</a></span>(1) “A thousand times the world in which the sun and moon revolve and light up the quarters with their brightness is called a thousandfold minor world system.<span class=note><sup id=note512>512</sup><q><em>Cūḷanikā lokadhātu</em>. Mp: “This is the domain of a disciple” (<em>ayaṃ sāvakassa visayo</em>).</q></span> In that thousandfold world system there are a thousand moons, a thousand suns, a thousand Sinerus king of mountains, a thousand Jambudīpas, a thousand Aparagoyānas, a thousand Uttarakurus, a thousand Pubbavidehas,<span class=note><sup id=note513>513</sup><q>These are the four continents, located respectively to the south, west, north, and east.</q></span> and a thousand four great oceans; a thousand four great kings, a thousand [heavens] of devas [ruled by] the four great kings, a thousand Tāvatiṃsa [heavens], a thousand [228] Yāma [heavens], a thousand Tusita [heavens], a thousand <a id="calibre_link-5046"></a>[heavens] of devas who delight in creation, a thousand [heavens] of devas who control what is created by others, a thousand brahmā worlds.</p>

It is necessary to use some such expression rather than “a two-thousandfold middling world system.” For the middling world system is not twice the size of a thousandfold minor world system, but <em>a thousand times</em> its size, that is, a thousandfold world system squared. Similarly, just below, a <em>tisahassī mahāsahassī lokadhātu</em> is not three times the size of a minor world system, but <em>a thousand times</em> the size of a thousand-to-the-second-power middling world system, in other words, a thousandfold world system cubed.</q></span> (3) A world that is a thousand times a thousand-to-the-second-power middling world system is called a thousand-to-the-third-power great world system.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p712 href=#p712>712</a></span>When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “It is my good fortune! I am very fortunate that my Teacher is so powerful and mighty.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p713 href=#p713>713</a></span>When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Ānanda: “What is it to you, friend Ānanda, that your Teacher is so powerful and mighty?”<span class=note><sup id=note516>516</sup><q>Mp: “This was the elder Lāḷudāyī (a troublemaker in the Saṅgha).

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p714 href=#p714>714</a></span>When this was said, the Blessed One said to the Venerable Udāyī: “Do not say so, Udāyī!

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p819 href=#p819>819</a></span>“Bhikkhus, if one were to say thus: ‘A person experiences kamma in precisely the same way that he created it,’ in such a case there could be no living of the spiritual life and no opportunity would <a id="calibre_link-5713"></a>be seen for completely making an end of suffering.<span class=note><sup id=note546>546</sup><q>0The point Mp is trying to make, it seems, is that if one has to experience the result of every kamma one has created of the type to be experienced upon rebirth, and of every kamma one has created of the type to be experienced in some life subsequent to the next, one would have to continue into the next rebirth, and into indefinite future rebirths, in order to experience those results. In such a case, because those kammas are bound to ripen, one would have to remain in saṃsāra forever in order to experience their fruits. It is not at all evident from the sutta itself, however, that this is the intended meaning. It seems, rather, that what the sutta is saying is that one need not experience the result of kamma in <em>exactly the same way</em> that one created it (so that, for example, if one killed a person one would not have to be killed in turn). The point, then, is that when one’s wholesome and unwholesome kammas ripen, they will have to be experienced, respectively, as pleasant and as painful, even though the <em>quantum</em> of pleasure and pain need not correspond to the moral force of the original action.</q></span> But if one were to say thus: ‘When a person creates kamma that is to be experienced in a particular way, he experiences its result precisely in that way,’ in such a case the living of the spiritual life is possible and an opportunity is seen for completely making an end of suffering.<span class=note><sup id=note547>547</sup><q>0The Chinese parallel, MĀ 11 (at T I 433a<small>12</small>–434a<small>11</small>), does not make a clear distinction between two contrary positions. I read it thus: “The Buddha told the bhikkhus: ‘[If one says:] “One receives the result of kamma according to the way it has been done by a person”—in this case, one does not practice the spiritual life and is unable to end suffering. If one says: “One receives the result of kamma according to the way it has been done by a person”—in this case, one practices the spiritual life and is able to end suffering’” (<img src="images/000088.jpg" class="calibre72"><img src="images/000074.jpg" class="calibre73"><img src="images/000077.jpg" class="calibre74">). Either there has been a mistake here in the textual transmission of the text, or the point in this version is that, of two people who hold the same view about karma, one does not practice and thus does not make an end to suffering, while the other practices and makes an end to suffering.</q></span></p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p976 href=#p976>976</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī at the Gotamaka Shrine.<span class=note><sup id=note585>585</sup><q>Mp: “In the first twenty years after the enlightenment, the Tathāgata often stayed among the deva communities (<em>devakulesuyeva</em>): sometimes at the Cāpāla Shrine, sometimes at the Sārandada, sometimes at the Bahuputta, and sometimes at the Gotamaka. Since he was living at Vesālī at this time, he stayed at the abode of the Gotamaka spirit.” Mp explains that this sutta was spoken as a sequel to the Mūlapariyāya Sutta (MN 1). The background story, told at Ps I 56–59, and translated at Bodhi 2006: 82–86, relates that a group of brahmins had taken ordination under the Buddha and quickly mastered his teachings. Filled with pride on account of their learning, they no longer went to listen to the Dhamma. The Buddha spoke the Mūlapariyāya Sutta to cut down their pride. Unable to understand it, they were humbled and apologized to the Buddha. Sometime later the Buddha spoke this Gotamaka Sutta to guide them to arahantship.</q></span> There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus …</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p977 href=#p977>977</a></span>“Bhikkhus, (1) I teach the Dhamma through direct knowledge, not without direct knowledge. (2) I teach the Dhamma with a basis, not without a basis. (3) I teach the Dhamma that is antidotal, not one without antidotes.<span class=note><sup id=note586>586</sup><q>0The term <em>sappāṭihāriya</em> is problematic. Elsewhere <em>pāṭihārya</em> is used in the sense of a wonder or miracle, as in <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN3.html#s60>3:60</a></strong> (at I 170– 72), which speaks of the three “wonders”: of psychic potency, thought-reading, and instruction. PED, sv <em>pāṭihārya</em>, sees <em>sappāṭihāriya</em> as derived from this usage and suggests, in contexts related to the Dhamma, “wonderful, extraordinary, sublime.” I find it hard, however, to agree that such a meaning is intended in this context. The verb <em>paṭiharati</em> means “to strike back,” and the causative <em>paṭihāreti</em> “to repel, to avoid.” I believe that this sense is relevant both to its use here and in relation to miracles. A miracle “strikes against” the mind’s fixed conceptual premises and opens it to the reality of the wondrous. But the Dhamma strikes in a different way. It “strikes against” distorted views and defilements, and thus it is counteractive or antidotal. This interpretation is supported by <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN8.html#s70>8:70</a></strong> (IV 310–11), where the Buddha states that his disciples “can thoroughly refute in reasoned ways the current tenets of others and teach the <em>sappāṭihāriya</em> Dhamma” (<em>uppannaṃ parappavādaṃ sahadhammena suniggahitaṃ niggahetvā sappāṭihāriyaṃ dhammaṃ desessanti</em>). Here the <em>sappāṭihāriya</em> character of the Dhamma must be related, not to miracles, but to its ability to counteract opposed tenets. Thus “antidotal” or “counteractive” would render the sense well.</q></span> Since I teach the Dhamma through direct knowledge, not without direct knowledge; since I teach the Dhamma with a basis, not without a basis; since I teach the Dhamma that is antidotal, not one without antidotes, my exhortation should be acted upon, my instructions should be acted upon. It is enough for you to rejoice, enough for you to be elated, enough for you to be joyful: ‘The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened! The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One! The Saṅgha is practicing the good path!’”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p978 href=#p978>978</a></span>This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement. And while this <a id="calibre_link-5933"></a>discourse was being spoken, the thousandfold world system shook.</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p983 href=#p983>983</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” Mahānāma replied. Then he went to Bharaṇḍu’s hermitage, prepared a mat, set out water for washing the feet, returned to the Blessed One, and said:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p984 href=#p984>984</a></span>“I have spread a mat, Bhante, and set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed One may go at his own convenience.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p985 href=#p985>985</a></span>Then the Blessed One went to Bharaṇḍu’s hermitage, sat down on the seat that was prepared for him, and washed his feet.

I will visit him tomorrow.” Then he paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p986 href=#p986>986</a></span>Then, when the night had passed, Mahānāma approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p989 href=#p989>989</a></span>When this was said, Bharaṇḍu the Kālāma said to Mahānāma: “Say the same, Mahānāma.” But the Blessed One said to Mahānāma: “Say different, Mahānāma.”</p>

Then, when the night had advanced, the young deva Hatthaka,<span class=note><sup id=note588>588</sup><q>Apparently this is Hatthaka of Āḷavī (see <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN1.html#s251>1:251</a></strong>), though Mp does not identify him as such.</q></span> illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, [while thinking:] “I will stand in front of the Blessed One,” he sank down, descended, and could not remain in place. Just as ghee or oil, when poured on sand, sinks down, descends, and does not remain in place, so the young deva Hatthaka, [while thinking:] “I will stand in front of the Blessed One,” sank down, descended, and could not remain in place. [279]</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p994 href=#p994>994</a></span>Then the Blessed One said to Hatthaka: “Create a gross body, Hatthaka.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p995 href=#p995>995</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” Hatthaka replied. Then he created a gross body, paid homage to the Blessed One, and stood to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p996 href=#p996>996</a></span>“Hatthaka, do those teachings that you could recall in the past, when you were a human being, come back to you now?”<span class=note><sup id=note589>589</sup><q>Mp explains <em>dhammā</em> … <em>pavattino</em> as “the Buddha-word that you learned in the past” (<em>pubbe uggahitabuddhavacanaṃ</em>).</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p997 href=#p997>997</a></span>“Bhante, those teachings that I could recall in the past, when I was a human being, come back to me now; and those teachings that I could not recall in the past, when I was a human being, come back to me now.<span class=note><sup id=note590>590</sup><q>Mp: “Teachings that he has forgotten because he neglected to recite them.”</q></span> Just as the Blessed One is now hemmed in by bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, male and female lay followers, kings <a id="calibre_link-5965"></a>and royal ministers, sectarian teachers and their disciples, so I am hemmed in by other young devas. Young devas come to me even from a distance, [thinking]: ‘We will hear the Dhamma from the young deva Hatthaka.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p998 href=#p998>998</a></span>“I died, Bhante, insatiable and unquenchable in three things. What three? (1) I died insatiable and unquenchable in seeing the Blessed One.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1001 href=#p1001>1001</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in Bārāṇasī at the deer park in Isipatana. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Bārāṇasī for alms.

Mp: “<em>Dissatisfied</em>: lacking the pleasure of the jhānas.

Mp: “He became a stream-enterer.” The suttas normally use a stock formula to indicate attainment of stream-entry, but nothing of this formula is found in the present text.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1004 href=#p1004>1004</a></span>When the Blessed One had walked for alms in Bārāṇasī, after his meal, when he had returned from his alms round, he addressed the bhikkhus:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1005 href=#p1005>1005</a></span>“Bhikkhus, this morning I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and entered Bārāṇasī for alms.

Having seen him, I said to that bhikkhu: ‘Bhikkhu, bhikkhu! Do not pollute yourself. It is inevitable, bhikkhu, that flies will pursue and attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench.’ Then, being exhorted thus by me, that bhikkhu acquired a sense of urgency.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1006 href=#p1006>1006</a></span>When this was said, a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One: “What, Bhante, is meant by ‘pollution’? What is the ‘stench’? And what are the ‘flies’?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1007 href=#p1007>1007</a></span>(1) “Longing, bhikkhu, is what is meant by ‘pollution.’ (2) Ill will is the ‘stench.’ (3) Bad unwholesome thoughts are the ‘flies.’ It is inevitable that flies will pursue and attack one who has polluted himself and been tainted by a stench.” [281]</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1012 href=#p1012>1012</a></span>Then the Venerable Anuruddha approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Now, Bhante, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses <a id="calibre_link-5715"></a>the human, I see that women, with the breakup of the body, after death, are mostly reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. What qualities does a woman possess on account of which, with the breakup of the body, after death, she is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1013 href=#p1013>1013</a></span>“When she possesses three qualities, Anuruddha, with the breakup of the body, after death, a woman is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. What three?</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1014 href=#p1014>1014</a></span>(1) “Here, Anuruddha, in the morning a woman dwells at home with a mind obsessed by the stain of miserliness. (2) At midday she dwells at home with a mind obsessed by envy. (3) And in the evening she dwells at home with a mind obsessed by sensual lust. When she possesses these three qualities, with the breakup of the body, after death, a woman is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.”</p>
<h3><a id=s130 href=#m130>130 (8) Anuruddha (2)</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1015 href=#p1015>1015</a></span>Then the Venerable Anuruddha approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, [282] he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1016 href=#p1016>1016</a></span>“Here, friend Sāriputta, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I survey a thousandfold world system. Energy is aroused in me without slackening; my mindfulness is established without confusion; my body is tranquil without disturbance; my mind is concentrated and one-pointed. Yet my mind is still not liberated from the taints through non-clinging.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1017 href=#p1017>1017</a></span>[The Venerable Sāriputta said:] (1) “Friend Anuruddha, when you think: ‘With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I survey a thousandfold world system,’ this is your conceit.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1018 href=#p1018>1018</a></span>(2) “And when you think: ‘Energy is aroused in me without slackening; my mindfulness is established without confusion; my body is tranquil without disturbance; my mind is concentrated and one-pointed,’ this is your restlessness.</p>

<p id="calibre_link-5001" class="calibre21">“It would be good if you would abandon these three qualities and stop attending to them. Instead, direct your mind to the deathless element.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1020 href=#p1020>1020</a></span>Some time later the Venerable Anuruddha abandoned those three qualities and stopped attending to them. Instead, he directed his mind to the deathless element. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Anuruddha realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: “Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.” And the Venerable Anuruddha became one of the arahants.</p>

(1) Women flourish when concealed, not when exposed.<span class=note><sup id=note599>599</sup><q>The exact import of this is not clear to me. Perhaps the sense is that women are best kept within the home rather than permitted to go out in public places on their own.

(1) <em>By way of arrival</em>, (i) one bhikkhu interprets in terms of non-self, sees in terms of non-self, and reaches the path by [contemplation of] non-self; for him, insight is called ‘emptiness.’ Why? Because of the absence of the defilements responsible for [the idea of] self or non-emptiness. The concentration of the path (<em>maggasamādhi</em>), being reached by insight, is called emptiness; and the concentration of the fruit (<em>phalasamādhi</em>), being reached by the path, is also called emptiness. (ii) Another interprets in terms of impermanence, sees in terms of impermanence, and reaches the path by [contemplation of] impermanence; for him, insight is called ‘mark-less.’ Why? Because of the absence of the defilements responsible for marks. The concentration of the path, being reached by insight, is called mark-less; and the concentration of the fruit, being reached by this path, is also called markless. (iii) Another interprets in terms of suffering, sees in terms of suffering, and reaches the path by [contemplation of] suffering; for him, insight is called ‘wishless.’ Why? Because of the absence of the defilements responsible for wishes. The concentration of the path, being reached by insight, is called wishless; and the concentration of the fruit, being reached by this path, is also called wishless. (2) <em>By way of quality</em>: The concentration of the path is empty because it is empty of lust, etc.; it is mark-less, because the marks of lust, etc., are absent; and it is wishless because wishes caused by lust, etc., are absent. (3) <em>By way of object</em>: Nibbāna is emptiness because it is empty of lust, etc.; it is markless and wishless, because it is without the marks of lust, etc., and without wishes caused by lust, etc.” Vism 657,<small>13</small>–259,<small>10</small>, Ppn 21.66–73, discusses the three “gateways to liberation” (<em>vimuttimukha</em>) under the same three names.</q></span> For direct knowledge of lust, these three things are to be developed.”</p>
