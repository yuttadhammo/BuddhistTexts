<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1 href=#p1>1</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjis at Bhaṇḍagāma. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p2 href=#p2>2</a></span>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:<span class=note><sup id=note618>618</sup><q>What follows is included in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, DN 16.4.2–3, II 122–23.</q></span> “Bhikkhus, it is because of not understanding and penetrating four things that you and I have roamed and wandered for such a long stretch of time.<span class=note><sup id=note619>619</sup><q><em>Dīghamaddhānaṃ sandhāvitaṃ saṃsaritaṃ</em>. The “long stretch” of wandering is <em>saṃsāra</em>, derived from the verb <em>saṃsarati</em>, seen here in the past participle <em>saṃsaritaṃ</em>. Mp glosses <em>dīghamaddhānaṃ</em> with <em>cirakālaṃ</em> (“a long time”) and explains <em>sandhāvitaṃ</em> as “roamed by going from one state of existence to another” (<em>bhavato bhavaṃ gamanavasena sandhāvitaṃ</em>).</q></span> What four?</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p3 href=#p3>3</a></span>“It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and penetrating noble virtuous behavior, noble concentration, noble wisdom, and noble liberation that you and I have roamed and wandered for such a long stretch of time.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p4 href=#p4>4</a></span>“Noble virtuous behavior has been understood and penetrated. Noble concentration has been understood and penetrated.

Therefore it is called the conduit to existence.”</q></span> now there is no more renewed existence.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p5 href=#p5>5</a></span>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this: [2]</p>

This is not proper, Master Gotama.’<span class=note><sup id=note651>651</sup><q>The placement of this sutta in the period just after the Buddha’s enlightenment seems strange.

See <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN8.html#s11>8:11</a></strong>, where a brahmin makes the same charge against the Buddha at a later time when he had already become a successful teacher.</q></span></p>

Cūḷasubhaddā contrived to get him to invite the Buddha and the monks for a meal offering. After the meal, the Buddha gave a discourse that established him in the fruit of stream-entry. Kāḷaka then built a monastery in his park and donated both monastery and park to the Buddha. One day, when the bhikkhus who were natives of Sāketa were sitting in the meeting hall discussing the Buddha’s success in converting Kāḷaka, the Buddha read their minds and knew they were ready for a discourse that would settle them in arahantship.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p206 href=#p206>206</a></span>“Whatever animals hear the lion roaring for the most part are filled with fear, a sense of urgency, and terror.

The other devas, as they attend to impermanence, experience both fear as mental fright (<em>cittutrāsabhaya</em>) and, at the time of strong insight, cognitive fear (<em>ñāṇabhaya</em>).” “Cognitive fear” is probably the stage of insight called “knowledge of appearance as fearful” (<em>bhayat’upaṭṭhānañāṇa</em>; see Vism 645–47, Ppn 21.29–34).</q></span> ‘It seems that we are actually impermanent, though we thought ourselves permanent; it seems that we are actually transient, though we thought ourselves everlasting; it seems that we are actually non-eternal, though we thought ourselves eternal.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p219 href=#p219>219</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. Then the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p220 href=#p220>220</a></span>“Master Gotama, we describe someone who possesses four qualities as a great man with great wisdom. What four?

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p226 href=#p226>226</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was traveling along the highway between Ukkaṭṭhā and Setavya.

Two Chinese parallels, SĀ 101 (at T II 28a<small>19</small>–28b<small>17</small>) and EĀ 38.3 (at T II 717c<small>18</small>–718a<small>12</small>), render this entire conversation as pertaining to the present. The brahmin asks the Buddha whether he is (<img src="images/000052.jpg" class="calibre82">) a deva, a nāga, etc., a human being, or a nonhuman being, and the Buddha simply denies (<img src="images/000022.jpg" class="calibre70">) that he is any of these.

By this he shows the arahant liberated in both respects (<em>ubhatobhāgavimuttaṃ khīṇāsavaṃ dasseti</em>), called a red-lotus ascetic because his virtues are complete, since he possesses the jhānas and direct knowledges.” On the colors of the two kinds of lotus flowers, <em>puṇḍarīka</em> and <em>paduma</em>, see <a class=seenote href=AN3.html#note389>AN3, note 389</a>. “The delicate ascetic among ascetics” (<em>samaṇesu samaṇasukhumālo</em>) is “one with soft mind and body, who experiences exclusively pleasure, free from bodily and mental pain” (<em>muducittasarīro kāyikacetasikadukkharahito ekantasukhī</em>).</q></span></p>

But the commentarial definition of the <em>ubhatobhāgavimutta</em> arahant allows one who possesses <em>any</em> of the formless attainments to count as “one liberated in both respects.” This, too, might represent a lowering of a more stringent criterion that would restrict the designation to an arahant possessing all eight emancipations.</q></span></p>

The worldling remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he goes to hell, to the animal realm, or to the sphere of afflicted spirits. But the Blessed One’s disciple remains there all his life, and when he has completed the entire life span of those devas, he attains final nibbāna in that very same state of existence. This is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling, that is, when there is future destination and rebirth.</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p746 href=#p746>746</a></span>“(1) Here, bhikkhus, some person has not abandoned the lower fetters, the fetters for obtaining rebirth, or the fetters for obtaining existence.<span class=note><sup id=note826>826</sup><q>In Pāli, the three kinds of fetters are, respectively: <em>orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni</em>, <em>upapattipaṭilābhiyāni saṃyojanāni</em>, <em>bhavapaṭilābhiyāni saṃyojanāni</em>. Mp distinguishes the last two thus: the “fetters for obtaining rebirth” are those by which one obtains the next rebirth (<em>yehi anantarā upapattiṃ paṭilabhati</em>); the “fetters for obtaining existence” are the conditions for obtaining rebirth-existence (<em>upapattibhavassa paṭilābhāya paccayāni</em>). Apparently the difference, from the commentary’s point of view, is that the former bind one only to the immediately following rebirth while the latter bind one to successive rebirths. But see note 829 below for an alternative interpretation.</q></span> [134] (2) Some other person has abandoned the lower fetters, but not the fetters for obtaining rebirth or the fetters for obtaining existence. (3) Still another person has abandoned the lower fetters and the fetters for obtaining rebirth, but not the fetters for obtaining existence. (4) And still another person has abandoned the lower fetters, the fetters for obtaining rebirth, and the fetters for obtaining existence.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p747 href=#p747>747</a></span>(1) “What kind of person has not abandoned the lower fetters, the fetters for obtaining rebirth, or the fetters for obtaining existence? The once-returner.<span class=note><sup id=note827>827</sup><q>Since the stream-enterer, too, has not abandoned any of these fetters, Mp explains: “The once-returner is mentioned to show the highest among the noble ones who have not abandoned any of the fetters.” Mp-ṭ: “That is, who have not abandoned the lower fetters. For above the once-returner, there is no noble one who has not abandoned the lower fetters. But isn’t it the case that once-returners have abandoned [some] lower fetters, for they have abandoned the fetters of views, doubt, and wrong grasp of rules and observances? In that case, why is it said that they have not abandoned the lower fetters? Because once-returners have not abandoned the fetters of sensual lust and ill will; therefore the statement that they have not abandoned the lower fetters is said with reference to those fetters that they have not abandoned. It does not mean that they have not abandoned any fetters.”</q></span> This person has not abandoned the lower fetters, the fetters for obtaining rebirth, or the fetters for obtaining existence.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p748 href=#p748>748</a></span>(2) “What kind of person has abandoned the lower fetters, but not the fetters for obtaining rebirth or the fetters for obtaining existence? The one bound upstream, heading toward the Akaniṭṭha realm.<span class=note><sup id=note828>828</sup><q><em>Uddhaṃsotassa akaniṭṭhagāmino puggalassa</em>. This refers to the most sluggish of the five classes of non-returners, who proceed upward through successive pure abodes to the highest one, called Akaniṭṭha. This type, too, is mentioned to show the coarsest who still retain the fetters of rebirth, but more acute classes of non-returners also retain these fetters.</q></span> This person has abandoned the lower fetters <a id="calibre_link-5016"></a>but not the fetters for obtaining rebirth or the fetters for obtaining existence.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p749 href=#p749>749</a></span>(3) “What kind of person has abandoned the lower fetters and the fetters for obtaining rebirth but not the fetters for obtaining existence? The one who attains final nibbāna in the interval.<span class=note><sup id=note829>829</sup><q>This statement creates a predicament for the traditional Theravādin interpretation of the five types of non-returners, which is based on Pp 16–17 and its commentary at Pp-a 198–201. The core of this interpretation is the rejection of an intermediate state (<em>antarābhava</em>) between two lives. Such rejection thus entails the need to interpret the <em>antarāparinibbāyī</em> as a non-returner who attains arahantship during the first half of the life span in the next existence. However, the word <em>antarāparinibbāyī</em> literally means “one who attains final nibbāna <em>in between</em>,” and there seems no legitimate reason, based on a sutta, to deny the possibility that certain non-returners, following their death in human form, enter an intermediate state and attain final nibbāna in that state itself, thereby circumventing the need to take another rebirth. This seems to be the purport of the present text, according to which the <em>antarāparinibbāyī</em> has abandoned the fetters of rebirth but not the fetters of existence. Upon attaining arahantship, the <em>antarāparinibbāyī</em> will also abandon the fetters of existence. I have discussed the five types of non-returners in detail in CDB 1902–3, note 65. For further discussion, see p. 1782, notes 1535–38; for additional textual analysis, see Harvey 1995: 98–108.</q></span> This person has abandoned the lower fetters and the fetters for obtaining rebirth but not the fetters for obtaining existence.</p>

<h3><a id=s159 href=#m159>159 (9) The Bhikkhunī</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p810 href=#p810>810</a></span>On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. Then a certain bhikkhunī addressed a man thus: ‘Come, good man, approach Master Ānanda and pay homage to him in my name with your head at his <a id="calibre_link-5335"></a>feet. Then say: ‘Bhante, the bhikkhunī so-and-so is sick, afflicted, gravely ill.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p811 href=#p811>811</a></span>“Yes, noble lady,” that man replied. He then approached the Venerable Ānanda, [145] paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and delivered his message. The Venerable Ānanda consented by silence.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p812 href=#p812>812</a></span>Then the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the bhikkhunīs’ quarters. When that bhikkhunī saw the Venerable Ānanda coming in the distance, she covered herself from the head down and lay down on her bed.<span class=note><sup id=note843>843</sup><q>It is puzzling that Ānanda goes unaccompanied to visit the bhikkhunī. Almost always when a bhikkhu goes to visit a layperson, even a male, he brings another monk along. In a Chinese parallel of this sutta, SĀ 564 (T II 148a<small>13</small>–148c<small>10</small>), as Ānanda approaches, the bhikkhunī sees him in the distance and exposes her body. When Ānanda sees her exposed, he restrains his senses and turns away. The nun then feels ashamed and puts on her clothes. She offers Ānanda a seat, pays homage to him, and sits down to one side. Apart from this circumstantial difference, Ānanda’s discourse in the Chinese version is almost exactly as in the Pāli version.</q></span> Then the Venerable Ānanda approached that bhikkhunī, sat down in the appointed seat, and said to her:</p>

The word <em>ānantariya</em> is of rare occurrence, so its meaning must be determined inferentially. One clue is the Ratana Sutta, which says: <em>yam buddhaseṭṭho parivaṇṇayī suciṃ samādhim ānantarikaññam āhu</em> (Sn 226). Any difference between <em>ānantarika</em> and <em>ānantariya</em> is insignificant, as the terminations <em>-iya</em> and <em>-ika</em> are often interchangeable. Another clue is SN <a class=seesutta href=SN22.html#s81>22:81</a>, at III 96–99, where the Buddha addresses the question: “How should one know and see to attain immediately (lit. ‘without interval’) the destruction of the taints?” (<em>evaṃ</em> … <em>jānato evaṃ passato anantarā āsavānaṃ khayo hoti</em>). Other AN suttas—<strong><a class=seesutta href=AN3.html#s102>3:102</a></strong>, I 158,<small>7–12</small>, and <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN5.html#s23>5:23</a></strong>, III 16,29–17,<small>2</small>—speak about the mind being “properly concentrated for the destruction of the taints” (<em>sammā samādhiyati āsavānaṃ khayāya</em>). See too <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN5.html#s170>5:170</a></strong>, III 202,<small>27–33</small>, which speaks about certain conditions “such that immediately afterward the destruction of the taints occurs” (<em>anantarā āsavānaṃ khayo hoti</em>). Thus, the “immediacy condition” spoken of here seems to be a state in which the mind is properly concentrated and, at the same time, has acquired the insight that brings about the destruction of the taints. Mp explains <em>ānantariya</em> with reference to the Abhidhamma concept of an immediate succession between path and fruit: “The ‘immediacy condition’ is the concentration of the path, which immediately yields its result (<em>anantaravipākadāyakaṃ maggasamādhiṃ</em>).” Though the suttas do not employ the scheme of the cognitive process that underlies the concept of path and fruition moments, the expression “immediacy condition” does suggest a state of complete ripeness for the breakthrough to arahantship.</q></span> This is called practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge.</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p877 href=#p877>877</a></span>On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus:</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p879 href=#p879>879</a></span>“Friend,” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this: [157]</p>

The latter is likely to be an editorial error. Though Mp does not provide a gloss here, the passage is cited at Paṭis II 92,<sub>9</sub>, and commented on at Paṭis-a III 584,<small>24–25</small>, in a way that requires <em>maggehi</em>: <em><strong>Catūhi maggehī</strong></em> <em>ti upari vuccamānehi catūhi paṭipadāmaggehi, na ariyamaggehi</em> (“<em>By four paths</em>: by the four paths of practice spoken about below, not by the noble paths”).</q></span> or by a certain one among them.

As he is pursuing, developing, and cultivating this path, the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.<span class=note><sup id=note859>859</sup><q>Mp and Mp-ṭ, read together, say that because there is no development and cultivation of the world-transcending path, which lasts for only one mind-moment, he develops and cultivates the preparatory mundane path (<em>pubbabhāgiyo lokiyamaggo</em>) for the purpose of attaining the higher world-transcending paths. Then the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted by the successive paths (<em>maggappaṭipāṭiya pahīyanti byantī honti</em>).</q></span></p>

Mp says that each time he attains a meditative attainment (<em>samāpatti</em>), he explores it by way of its conditioned phenomena. And having explored its conditioned phenomena, he enters the next attainment. Thus, having attained the first jhāna, he emerges and explores its conditioned phenomena as impermanent, etc. Then he enters the second jhāna, emerges, and explores its conditioned phenomena, and so on up to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Since, however, <em>yuganaddha</em> means literally “yoked together,” some interpret the term to mean that in this mode of practice serenity and insight occur simultaneously. The commentarial system does not acknowledge this possibility but several suttas might be read as suggesting that insight can occur within the jhāna and does not require the meditator to withdraw before beginning contemplation. In AN, see in particular <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN9.html#s36>9:36</a></strong>; see too MN 52.4–14, I 350–52; MN 64.9–15, I 435–37.</q></span> As he is developing serenity and insight in conjunction, the path is generated.

Ee has <em>dhammuddhaccaviggahītamanā</em>; the termination <em>-manā</em> is suspicious. Be has -<em>viggahitaṃ mānasaṃ</em>. Ce has <em>-viggahītaṃ mānaṃ</em>. While <em>manā</em> and <em>mānasaṃ</em> can both be translated as “mind,” <em>mānaṃ</em> normally means “conceit.” The Sinhala translation seems to support this by rendering <em>mānaṃ</em> as <em>adhimānaya</em> (Pāli <em>adhimāna</em>), “overestimation of oneself,” but to speak of “conceit”—as opposed to “mind”—as being “grasped by restlessness” does not make good sense. Mp glosses the term without specifying the subject: “Grasped, thoroughly grasped, by restlessness, which consists of the ten corruptions of insight (<em>dasa vipassan’upakkilesā</em>; see Vism 633–38, Ppn 20.105–28) in regard to the <em>dhammas</em> of serenity and insight.” Nothing in the text itself suggests the corruptions of insight are involved. I understand the person being described here as a practitioner who reflects deeply on the Dhamma, acquires a sense of urgency, and then finally settles down and gains insight when meeting with favorable supporting conditions. In the next sentence of the text, the word rendered “mind” is <em>cittaṃ</em>.</q></span> But there comes an occasion when his mind becomes internally steady, composed, unified, and concentrated. Then the path is generated in him. He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it.

I summarize Mp’s explanation: Bodily volition is of twenty kinds by way of the eight kinds of sense-sphere wholesome <em>cittas</em> and twelve kinds of unwholesome <em>cittas</em>. So too for verbal volition. But mental volition includes these as well as the nine kinds of sublime (<em>mahaggata</em>) volition, namely, volition associated with the five jhānas of the Abhidhamma system and the four formless attainments. Because of bodily volition, there arises pleasure conditioned by the eight kinds of wholesome kamma, and pain conditioned by the twelve kinds of unwholesome kamma, that is, the kamma generated in the corresponding active types of consciousness. So too for the other two doors. Ignorance is a condition (<em>avijjāpaccayā va</em>) because, there being ignorance, volition occurs in the three doors as a condition for pleasure and pain. Thus this sutta statement refers to ignorance as the root cause. Pleasure and pain arise “internally” (<em>ajjhattaṃ</em>) when they arise in oneself. The word seems to underscore the retributive aspect of kamma.</q></span></p>

Mp glosses these two words respectively with <em>kāraṇaso akkharaso</em>, “by way of reasons [or cases], by way of the letter.” The meaning is not entirely clear to me and Mp-ṭ does not elaborate. The <em>paṭisambhidās</em> are explained at Vism 440–43, Ppn 14.21–31, on the basis of Vibh 292–94 (Be §§718–24), which analyzes them from several angles. Briefly: Knowledge of meaning is analytical knowledge of meaning (<em>atthapaṭisambhidā</em>); knowledge of Dhamma is analytical knowledge of Dhamma (<em>dhammapaṭisambhidā</em>); knowledge of how to express and articulate the Dhamma is analytical knowledge of language (<em>niruttipaṭisambhidā</em>); and knowledge about knowledges is analytical knowledge of discernment (<em>paṭibhānapaṭisambhidā</em>). This last analytical knowledge seems to refer to the ability to spontaneously apply the other three types of knowledge to clearly communicate the Dhamma. From a more philosophical perspective, <em>attha</em> is considered the result of a cause (<em>hetuphala</em>) and <em>dhamma</em> a cause (<em>hetu</em>) producing an effect. Therefore the analytical knowledge of meaning is correlated with knowledge of the first and third noble truths, analytical knowledge of Dhamma with knowledge of the second and fourth noble truths. Analytical knowledge of meaning is knowledge of each factor of dependent origination in its role as an effect arisen from a condition, and analytical knowledge of Dhamma is knowledge of the same factor in its role as a condition giving rise to an effect.</q></span> In many ways I explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it.<span class=note><sup id=note876>876</sup><q>Ee’s <em>pakāsemi</em>, as the third verb, is not in Ce or Be. <em>Pakāseti</em> is also absent in the same sequence of verbs at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN3.html#s136>3:136</a></strong>, I 286,<small>9–10</small>, also in Ee.</q></span> [Let] anyone who is perplexed or uncertain [approach] me with a <a id="calibre_link-5088"></a>question; I [will satisfy him] with my answer.<span class=note><sup id=note877>877</sup><q>The text is cryptic here and may have become garbled in the course of transmission.

Even a little given to such a Saṅgha of bhikkhus, to such an assembly, becomes plentiful, while much given to it becomes even more plentiful.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1127 href=#p1127>1127</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Then Vappa the Sakyan, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna then said to him:</p>

He would cut down the stump at its foot, dig it up, and pull out the roots, even the fine rootlets and root-fibers. He would cut the stump into pieces, split the pieces, and reduce them to slivers. Then he would dry the slivers in the wind and sun, burn them in a fire, and reduce them to ashes. Having done so, he would winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river.

Wholesome and unwholesome kamma are like the shadow depending on the tree. The meditator is like the man who wants to remove the shadow; wisdom is like the shovel; concentration is like the basket; insight is like the pick (<em>khaṇitti</em>, not mentioned in the sutta; DOP defines both <em>kuddāla</em> and <em>khaṇitti</em> as a digging tool, a spade, a trowel). The time of digging up the roots with the pick is like the time of cutting off ignorance with the path of arahantship. The time of reducing the stump to pieces is like the time of seeing the aggregates; the time of splitting the pieces is like the time of seeing the sense bases; the time of reducing them to slivers is like the time of seeing the elements. The time of drying the slivers in the wind and sun is like the time of applying bodily and mental energy. The time of burning the slivers in a fire is like the time of burning the defilements with knowledge. The time of reducing them to ash is like the time when the five aggregates are still occurring [after one reaches arahantship]. The time of winnowing the ashes in a strong wind and letting them be carried away by the current is like the cessation of the five aggregates, which have been cut off at the root with no further rebirth. As the ashes winnowed and carried away go to the indiscernible state (<em>apaññattibhāvūpagamo</em>), so should one understand the indescribable state (<em>appaṇṇattibhāvo</em>) [reached] by the non-arising of resultant aggregates in renewed existence.”</q></span></p>

For bhikkhus, they consist of four offenses that entail expulsion from the Saṅgha: sexual intercourse, theft (to a degree punishable by law), murder of a human being, and making a false claim to a superhuman state of spiritual distinction. Bhikkhunīs have four additional <em>pārājikas.</em> The only way for one who has committed one of these offenses to “make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma” is to admit it and relinquish one’s status as a fully ordained monk or nun.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1403 href=#p1403>1403</a></span>Then the Venerable Māluṅkyāputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:<span class=note><sup id=note967>967</sup><q>He is the monk who threatened to leave the Buddha if the latter would not answer his metaphysical questions. See MN 63, I 426–32, as well as MN 64.2–3, I 432–33; SN <a class=seesutta href=SN35.html#s95>35:95</a>, IV 72–76.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1404 href=#p1404>1404</a></span>“Bhante, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute.”</p>
<p id="calibre_link-5337" class="calibre21">“Here now, Māluṅkyāputta, what should we say to the young bhikkhus when an old man like you, decrepit and advanced in years, asks for a brief exhortation from the Tathāgata?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1405 href=#p1405>1405</a></span>“Bhante, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Let the Fortunate One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Perhaps I can understand the meaning of the Blessed One’s statement; perhaps I can become an heir of the Blessed One’s statement.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1406 href=#p1406>1406</a></span>“There are, Māluṅkyāputta, these four sources of craving for a bhikkhu. What four?

[249] When, Māluṅkyāputta, a bhikkhu has abandoned craving, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1407 href=#p1407>1407</a></span>Then the Venerable Māluṅkyāputta, exhorted in this way by the Blessed One, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1408 href=#p1408>1408</a></span>Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Māluṅkyāputta realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: “Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.” And the Venerable Māluṅkyāputta became one of the arahants.</p>
