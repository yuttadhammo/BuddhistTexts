<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1 href=#p1>1</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p2 href=#p2>2</a></span>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

So too, sound but not form captivates one who esteems sound, etc. For some people, only one sense object obsesses the mind; for others, two objects—or three, four, or five objects—obsess them.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p13 href=#p13>13</a></span>“Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing on account of which unarisen sensual desire arises and arisen sensual desire increases and expands so much as the mark of the attractive.<span class=note><sup id=note23>23</sup><q><em>Subhanimitta</em>. Mp: “The mark of the attractive is an object that is a basis for lust.” Mp cites various uses of the word <em>nimitta</em>: as a condition (<em>paccaya</em>), a cause (<em>kāraṇa</em>), concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and insight (<em>vipassanā</em>). Here it means “an agreeable object that is a basis for lust” (<em>rāgaṭṭhāniyo iṭṭhārammaṇadhammo</em>). Mp glosses <em>ayoniso manasikaroto</em> with <em>anupāyena manasikarontassa</em> (“for one who attends unskillfully”) and cites the definition of “careless attention” (<em>ayoniso manasikāra</em>) at Vibh 373 (Be §936): “Careless attention is deviant attention, which takes the impermanent to be permanent, suffering to be happiness, what is non-self to be self, and the unattractive to be attractive. Or it is the mental turning, advertence, leaning, consideration, attention [to an object] in a way that runs contrary to the [four noble] truths.” It seems to me doubtful that this explanation of <em>ayoniso manasikāra</em> will hold for all applications of the term in the Nikāyas. Even in the following sutta, on the arising and increase of ill will, it is questionable that attending carelessly to “the mark of the repulsive” can be subsumed under any of the four distortions in the definition at Vibh 373.</q></span> For one who attends carelessly to the mark of the attractive, unarisen sensual desire arises and arisen sensual desire increases and expands.”</p>

Mp: “This denotes a disagreeable mark; it is a designation for aversion (repulsion) and for a repulsive object” (<em>aniṭṭhaṃ nimittaṃ; paṭighassapi paṭighassārammaṇassapi etaṃ adhivacanaṃ</em>). Interestingly, Mp continues with a citation from “the commentary”: “For it is said in the commentary: ‘The mark of the repulsive is aversion (repulsion) and a repulsive object’” (<em>vuttampi c’etaṃ aṭṭhakathāyaṃ paṭighampi paṭighanimittaṃ, paṭighārammaṇopi dhammo paṭighanimittan ti</em>). Mp-ṭ identifies “the commentary” as “the Great Commentary” (<em>mahā aṭṭhakathā</em>), one of the ancient Sinhala commentaries that Buddhaghosa used as the source for his own commentaries. These ancient commentaries are no longer extant, but this allusion makes it clear that Buddhaghosa worked with sources and did not write original compositions.</q></span> For one who attends carelessly to the mark of the repulsive, unarisen ill will arises and arisen ill will increases and expands.”</p>

This explanation relies on the Vism scheme, which takes the <em>asubha</em> objects to be corpses in stages of decomposition (see Vism 178–93, Ppn 6.1–80). While we do find meditation on decaying corpses in the Nikāyas (see below at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN1.html#s480>1:480</a>–84</strong>), more typically the suttas explain the perception of the unattractive (<em>asubhasaññā</em>) as meditation on the thirty-one components of the body (increased to thirty-two in later works by adding the brain). See, for example, <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN10.html#s60>10:60</a> §3</strong>, on the perception of unattractiveness. This perception occurs among a group of five meditation subjects that culminate in the deathless (<strong><a class=seesutta href=AN5.html#s61>5:61</a></strong>), that lead to nibbāna (<strong><a class=seesutta href=AN5.html#s69>5:69</a></strong>) and to the destruction of the taints (<strong><a class=seesutta href=AN5.html#s70>5:70</a></strong>), and that bring liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom (<strong><a class=seesutta href=AN5.html#s71>5:71</a></strong>). At <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN7.html#s49>7:49</a> §1</strong>, the perception of unattractiveness is recommended as the antidote to sexual desire, and at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN9.html#s1>9:1</a> §6</strong> and <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN9.html#s3>9:3</a> §6</strong> it is prescribed for the abandoning of lust.</q></span> For one who attends carefully to the mark of the unattractive, unarisen sensual desire does not arise and arisen sensual desire is abandoned.”<span class=note><sup id=note30>30</sup><q>In line with the commentary to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (at Sv III 778–82, Ps I 282–86), Mp enumerates six things that lead to the abandoning of each of the five hindrances. The six that lead to the abandoning of sensual desire are: learning an unattractive object, meditation on an unattractive object, guarding the doors of the sense faculties, moderation in eating, good friendship, and suitable conversation.</q></span></p>
<h3><a id=s17 href=#m17>17 (7)</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p19 href=#p19>19</a></span>“Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing on account of which unarisen ill will does not arise and arisen ill will is abandoned so much as the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness.<span class=note><sup id=note31>31</sup><q><em>Mettācetovimutti</em>. Mp: “Loving-kindness pervades all beings with [the wish for] their welfare. Since the mind associated with it is liberated from the opposed states such as the hindrances, it is called liberation of mind (<em>cetovimutti</em>). Specifically, this ‘liberation of mind’ is liberated from obsession by ill will. Here, what is intended by ‘liberation of mind’ is absorption (<em>appanā</em>) by three or four jhānas [depending on whether the fourfold or fivefold scheme of jhānas is used].” Mp-ṭ: “[This is said] because there is no thorough liberating [of the mind] by loving-kindness until one attains absorption.” At <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN6.html#s13>6:13</a> §1</strong> loving-kindness is taught as the escape from ill will. At <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN9.html#s1>9:1</a> §7</strong> and <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN9.html#s3>9:3</a> §7</strong>, it is recommended for abandoning ill will. <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN8.html#s63>8:63</a> §1</strong> teaches different approaches to developing the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness, and <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN8.html#s1>8:1</a></strong> and <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN11.html#s15>11:15</a></strong> explain, respectively, eight and eleven benefits of mastering the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness. The fourfold scheme of jhānas is typical of the Nikāyas; the fivefold scheme appears in the Abhidhamma by dividing the second jhāna into two: the second with examination but without thought, the third without thought and examination.</q></span> For one who attends carefully to the liberation of the mind by loving-kindness, unarisen ill will does not arise and arisen ill will is abandoned.”<span class=note><sup id=note32>32</sup><q>Mp mentions six things that lead to the abandoning of ill will: learning the meditation on loving-kindness, cultivating meditation on loving-kindness, reviewing ownership of kamma, abundant reflection, good friendship, and suitable conversation. On “reviewing ownership of kamma,” Mp says that one should reflect thus: “If you get angry with another person, what can you do? Can you destroy his virtuous behavior, etc.? Didn’t you come into this world on account of your own kamma and won’t you depart through your own kamma? Getting angry with another person is like taking hold of a hot flameless coal or an iron stake smeared with excrement in order to strike someone. If he gets angry with you, what can he do? Can he destroy your virtuous behavior, etc.? Didn’t he come into this world on account of his own kamma and won’t he depart through his own kamma? Just like an offering of a cake that is refused, or like a fist full of dust thrown against the wind, his anger will remain with him.” For more ways of overcoming anger, see Vism 298–306, Ppn 9:14–39.</q></span></p>

I follow Be and Ce in counting as a separate vagga or subchapter each group of ten (or more) suttas, each sutta being determined by the announcement of a particular disciple as foremost. Ee, in contrast, takes each grouping (subchapter) as one large sutta. Many of the facts and references in my notes to these chapters have been gleaned from DPPN.</q></span></h2>

When he visited Rājagaha and saw the gains that accrued to the bhikkhus, he decided to become a monk. In his early days as a bhikkhu he was gluttonous, but the Buddha taught him to be moderate in eating. He soon attained arahantship with the six direct knowledges. He was rebuked by the Buddha for using his psychic powers to win a sandalwood bowl (Vin II 110–12). He converses with King Udena about sense restraint at SN <a class=seesutta href=SN35.html#s127>35:127</a>, IV 110–13. He is praised in Ud 4:6, 42–43. His verses are at Th 123–24.</q></span></p>

Because he was born by a roadside (<em>pantha</em>), he was given the name Panthaka. He is praised in Ud 5:10, 61. His verses are at Th 557–66.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p136 href=#p136>136</a></span>(199) “… among those skilled in mental transformation is Cullapanthaka.”</p>

Being elder, when his brother was born he was called Mahā (large, great) and his brother Culla (small). His verses are at Th 510–17. Mp says that Cullapanthaka was particularly skilled in concentration and was therefore the foremost in mental transformation (<em>cetovivaṭṭa</em>). Mahāpanthaka was particularly skilled in insight and was therefore foremost in the transformation of perception (<em>saññāvivaṭṭa</em>). Mp-ṭ explains the difference thus: “One skilled in mental transformation is an attainer of the form-sphere jhānas who, in regard to a single object, is able to transform the mind of concentration (<em>samādhicittaṃ</em>) from successively lower jhānas to successively higher ones. One skilled in transformation of perception is skilled in transforming the aforesaid jhānas under the heading of perception, passing beyond the perceptions of form and moving from [the perception] associated with the base of the infinity of space to that associated with the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Similarly, he is able to transform the mind from the perception of women and men, etc., and from the perception of permanence, etc., toward mere form and formless phenomena and, especially, toward the unconditioned nibbāna. Such a one is accustomed to the contemplation of emptiness (<em>suññatānupassanābahulo</em>).”</q></span></p>

He attained arahantship by developing insight based on the meditation of loving-kindness. Before teaching the Dhamma and when receiving almsfood, he would first enter jhāna through loving-kindness and then emerge. The Buddha explains to him the manifestations of faith at <strong>11:14</strong>. His skill in meditation is praised in Ud 6:7, 71. His verse is at Th 1. Subhūti figures prominently in the [Mahāyāna] Prajñāpāramitā sūtras as chief exponent of the perfection of wisdom.</q></span></p>

But the noble disciple is powerful since he does not do such deeds.’” Regarding the shedding of a Tathāgata’s blood, Mp says that the expression “with a mind of hatred” (<em>paduṭṭhacitto</em>) is used to highlight the motive. Devadatta, who wanted to kill the Buddha and take control of the Saṅgha, wounded the Buddha in a failed assassination attempt and thereby committed an <em>ānantariya kamma</em>. But the physician Jīvaka, wishing to restore the Buddha’s health, cut his skin to extract bad blood; he thereby did a meritorious deed. On schism in the Saṅgha (<em>saṅghabheda</em>), see <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN10.html#s37>10:37</a></strong>, <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN10.html#s39>10:39</a></strong>.</q></span></p>

Though arahant disciples achieve <em>sambodhi</em>, full enlightenment, and are occasionally spoken of as <em>sambuddha</em>, “enlightened,” the designation <em>sammā sambuddha</em> is reserved for the founder, who alone attains <em>anuttara sammā sambodhi</em>, “unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.”</q></span> [28] could arise contemporaneously in one world system; there is no such possibility. But it is possible that one arahant who is a perfectly enlightened Buddha might arise in one world system; there is such a possibility.”<span class=note><sup id=note155>155</sup><q>Mp explains the word “contemporaneously” (<em>apubbaṃ acarimaṃ</em>, lit., “not before, not after”) to cover the period from the time a bodhisatta enters his mother’s womb until the Buddha’s relics disappear. There can be only one Buddha at a time because a Buddha is without a counterpart or peer (see <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN1.html#s172>1:172</a></strong>, <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN1.html#s174>1:174</a></strong>). Thus if two Buddhas were to arise simultaneously, this statement would be invalidated. The issue is also dealt with at Mil 236–39, cited by Mp. Mp says that because no suttas speak of the arising of Buddhas in other world systems, while there are suttas that say Buddhas do not arise elsewhere, it is only in <em>this</em> world system (<em>imasmiṃyeva cakkavāḷe</em>) that they arise. Mp-ṭ cites several suttas that it interprets as excluding the possibility of Buddhas arising elsewhere, but these texts do not seem to be as categorical as the author supposes. Perhaps this argument was intended to counter the idea being advanced in early Mahāyāna sūtras (or even among other pre-Mahāyāna schools) that Buddhas arise in the world systems of the ten directions.

But it is possible that a man could occupy the position of Brahmā; there is such a possibility.”<span class=note><sup id=note157>157</sup><q>It seems that in the old Nikāyas the idea of aspiring for future Buddhahood is not raised at all. Thus the claim being made here is not that a woman cannot become a perfectly enlightened Buddha in a future life but that a Buddha is always male. The assertion in this sutta need not be read as excluding the possibility that one who is presently a woman could become a Buddha, but this would have to take place in a future life, after she has undergone a change of gender. The statements are no doubt formulated in the context of the Indian culture of the period, which always assigned positions of authority to males. MĀ 181, a Chinese parallel of MN 115, does not include the section on the inabilities of women. Nevertheless, we do find the declaration that a woman cannot become a Buddha in another Chinese parallel of the sutta, at T XVII 713b<small>20–22</small>. It also occurs in a sūtra quoted in the Abhidharma Mahāvibhāṣā at T XXVI 502b<small>16–18</small>, and in the *Śāriputrābhidharma Śāstra at T XXVIII, 600b<small>10–12</small>. According to such later canonical texts as the Buddhavaṃsa, if a woman resolves to attain Buddhahood in the presence of a Buddha, her resolution does not succeed (i.e., she does not receive the prediction of future Buddhahood). For the resolution to succeed, the aspirant must be a male who has left the home life. See Bodhi 2007: 251–53. Sakka is the ruler of the devas in the Tāvatiṃsa heaven.</q></span></p>

Here is Mp (abridged): “Recollection of the Buddha serves two purposes: giving joy to the mind and promoting insight (<em>cittasampahaṃsanatthañ c’eva vipassanatthañca</em>). How? When a bhikkhu develops a meditation subject like unattractiveness [of the body], his mind may be disturbed, dissatisfied, and joyless. It does not remain on track but roams around like a wild bull. On that occasion, he should put aside his basic meditation subject and recollect the excellent qualities of the Tathāgata. As he recollects the Buddha, his mind becomes placid and free from hindrances. He can then return to his basic meditation object, develop insight, and reach the plane of the noble ones. Thus recollection of the Buddha gives joy to the mind. But one can also use this meditation subject directly for the purpose of developing insight. After recollecting the Buddha, one dissects the act of recollection into the five aggregates and defines them thus: ‘These five aggregates are, in brief, the truth of suffering. The craving that produced them is the truth of the origin. The cessation of craving is the truth of cessation; and the practice that understands cessation is the truth of the path.’ Thus one has defined the four truths in the preliminary portion [the stage of insight] and one step by step reaches the stage of the noble ones.”</q></span> This is that one thing that, when developed and cultivated, leads exclusively to disenchantment … to nibbāna.”</p>

Analogously, in <em>kāye kāyānupassī viharati</em>, the <em>kāya</em> conjoined with <em>anupassī</em> is the aspect that is contemplated (the “bodiness” of the body) and the locative <em>kāye</em> is the domain in relation to which that aspect is contemplated. Strictly speaking <em>kāyānupassī</em> does not actually mean “contemplating the body,” but “a body-contemplator.” Thus a very literal translation of the phrase would be: “He dwells as a body-contemplator in relation to the body.” Since such a rendering would sound awkward in English, I fall back on the familiar “contemplating the body in the body.” Similar considerations apply to the other three <em>satipaṭṭhānas</em>.</q></span> ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world … (403) dwells contemplating feelings in feelings … (404) dwells contemplating mind in mind … (405) dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world …”</p>
