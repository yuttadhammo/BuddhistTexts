What can I do to satisfy him?’ Tied up by the feeding trough, he does not meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ For that excellent thoroughbred horse regards the application of the goad as a debt, a bond, a loss, and failure. So too, an excellent thoroughbred person, when gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, does not dwell with a mind obsessed and oppressed by sensual lust, and he understands as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust.

However, a search through CST 4.0 fails to locate these words anywhere in the Nikāyas.
