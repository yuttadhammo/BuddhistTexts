<h3><a id=s1 href=#m1>1 (1) In Brief</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1 href=#p1>1</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p2 href=#p2>2</a></span>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p3 href=#p3>3</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these five trainee’s powers.<span class=note><sup id=note974>974</sup><q><em>Pañca sekhabalāni</em>. Despite a partial overlap, these should not be confused with the five powers (<em>pañca balāni</em>) included among the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment, which are introduced at <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN5.html#s13>5:13</a>–16</strong>. Mp: “<em>Trainee’s powers</em>: the powers of the seven trainees. The power of faith is so called because it does not waver (<em>na kampati</em>) in the face of faithlessness; the power of moral shame does not waver in the face of moral shamelessness; the power of moral dread does not waver in the face of moral recklessness; the power of energy does not waver in the face of laziness; and the power of wisdom does not waver in the face of ignorance.”</q></span> What five? The power of faith, the power of moral shame, the power of moral dread, the power of energy, and the power of wisdom. These are the five trainee’s powers. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We will possess the power of faith, a trainee’s power; we will possess the power of moral shame, a trainee’s power; we will possess the power of moral dread, a trainee’s power; we will possess the power of energy, a trainee’s power; we will possess the power of wisdom, a trainee’s power.’ Thus, bhikkhus, should you train yourselves.” [This is what the Blessed One said.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p5 href=#p5>5</a></span>(1) “And what, bhikkhus, is the power of faith? Here, a noble disciple is endowed with faith.

Here, a noble disciple is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering.<span class=note><sup id=note977>977</sup><q>Mp explains <em>udayatthagāminī paññā</em>, “the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away,” as “the wisdom able to penetrate the arising and vanishing of the five aggregates (<em>pañcannaṃ khandhānaṃ udayavayagāminiyā udayañca vayañca paṭivijjhituṃ samatthāya</em>). It is the wisdom of the path together with insight wisdom (<em>vipassanāpaññāya c’eva maggapaññāya</em>).”</q></span> This is called the power of wisdom.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p10 href=#p10>10</a></span>“These are the five trainee’s powers.

What five? Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of faith, morally shameless, morally reckless, lazy, and unwise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering in this very life—with distress, anguish, and fever—and with the breakup of the body, after death, he can expect a bad destination.</p>

<h3><a id=s6 href=#m6>6 (6) Entering</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p17 href=#p17>17</a></span>(1) “Bhikkhus, there is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as faith is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p18 href=#p18>18</a></span>(2) “There is no entering upon the unwholesome so long as a sense of moral shame is securely settled in [cultivating] wholesome qualities.

<h3><a id=s7 href=#m7>7 (7) Sensual Pleasures</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p22 href=#p22>22</a></span>“Bhikkhus, beings for the most part are captivated by sensual pleasures. When a clansman has forsaken the sickle and carrying-pole and gone forth from the household life into homelessness, he can be described as a clansman who has gone forth out of faith. For what reason? Sensual pleasures, whether of this or that kind, can be obtained by a youth. Inferior sensual pleasures, middling sensual pleasures, and superior sensual pleasures are all reckoned simply as sensual pleasures. [6]</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p23 href=#p23>23</a></span>“Suppose a young infant boy, ignorant, lying on his back, were to put a stick or pebble in his mouth because of his nurse’s heedlessness. His nurse would quickly attend to him and try to take it out. If she could not quickly take it out, she would brace the boy’s head with her left hand and, hooking a finger of her right hand, she would take it out even if she had to draw blood. For what reason? There would be some distress for the boy—this I don’t deny—but the nurse has to do so for his good and welfare, out of compassion for him. However, when the boy has grown up and has enough sense, the nurse would be unconcerned about him, thinking: ‘The boy can now look after himself. He won’t be heedless.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p24 href=#p24>24</a></span>“So too, so long as a bhikkhu is still not accomplished in faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in a sense of shame in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in moral dread in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, in energy in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, and in wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, I must still look after him. But when that bhikkhu is accomplished in faith in [cultivating] wholesome qualities … accomplished in wisdom in [cultivating] wholesome qualities, then I am unconcerned about him, thinking: ‘The bhikkhu can now look after himself.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p74 href=#p74>74</a></span>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the development of noble five-factored right concentration.<span class=note><sup id=note995>995</sup><q>Since the concentration to be explained below is primarily the four jhānas and, probably, the concentration of insight, Mp does not take the word <em>ariya</em> here to refer to the noble paths and fruits but as meaning “far away from the defilements abandoned by way of suppression (<em>vikkhambhanavasena pahīnakilesehi ārakā ṭhitassa</em>).” In the commentaries, <em>ariya</em> is sometimes derived from <em>āraka</em>. While the etymology is playful, it is likely that this <em>samādhi</em> belongs to the preparatory practice for reaching the paths and fruits, not to the paths and fruits themselves.</q></span> Listen and attend closely. I will speak.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p75 href=#p75>75</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p76 href=#p76>76</a></span>“And what, bhikkhus, is the development of noble five-factored right concentration?</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p77 href=#p77>77</a></span>(1) “Here, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. He makes the rapture and happiness born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of seclusion. <a id="calibre_link-6099"></a>Just as a skillful bath man or a bath man’s apprentice might heap bath powder in a metal basin and, sprinkling it gradually with water, would knead it until the moisture wets his ball of bath powder, soaks it, and pervades it inside and out, yet the ball itself does not ooze; so too, the bhikkhu makes the rapture and happiness born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of seclusion. This is the first development of noble five-factored right concentration.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p78 href=#p78>78</a></span>(2) “Again, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. He makes the rapture and happiness born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of concentration. Just as there might be a lake whose waters welled up from below with no inflow from east, west, north, [26] or south, and the lake would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain, then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench, steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that there would be no part of the whole lake that is not pervaded by cool water; so too, the bhikkhu makes the rapture and happiness born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the rapture and happiness born of concentration. This is the second development of noble five-factored right concentration.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p79 href=#p79>79</a></span>(3) “Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, he experiences pleasure with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ He makes the happiness divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and <a id="calibre_link-6157"></a>pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the happiness divested of rapture. Just as, in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water might thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and cool water would drench, steep, fill, and pervade them to their tips and their roots, so that there would be no part of those lotuses that would not be pervaded by cool water; so too, the bhikkhu makes the happiness divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the happiness divested of rapture. This is the third development of noble five-factored right concentration.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p80 href=#p80>80</a></span>(4) “Again, with the abandoning of pleasure [27] and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity. He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the pure bright mind. Just as a man might be sitting covered from the head down with a white cloth, so that there would be no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the white cloth; so too, the bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body that is not pervaded by the pure bright mind. This is the fourth development of noble five-factored right concentration.</p>

Just as one person might look upon another—as one standing might look upon one sitting down, or one sitting down might look upon one lying down—so too, a bhikkhu has grasped well the object of reviewing, attended to it well, sustained it well, and penetrated it well with wisdom.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p96 href=#p96>96</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of walking meditation. What five? [30] One becomes capable of journeys; one becomes capable of striving; one becomes healthy; what one has eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted is properly digested; the concentration attained through walking meditation is long lasting.<span class=note><sup id=note998>998</sup><q><em>Cīraṭṭhitiko hoti</em>.

<h3><a id=s30 href=#m30>30 (10) Nāgita</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p97 href=#p97>97</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus when he reached the Kosalan brahmin village named Icchānaṅgala. There the Blessed One dwelled in the Icchānaṅgala woodland thicket. The brahmin householders of Icchānaṅgala heard: “It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is now dwelling in the Icchānaṅgala woodland thicket. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: ‘That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having realized by his own direct knowledge this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p98 href=#p98>98</a></span>Then, when the night had passed, the brahmin householders of Icchānaṅgala took abundant food of various kinds and went <a id="calibre_link-4979"></a>to the Icchānaṅgala woodland thicket. They stood outside the entrance making an uproar and a racket. [31] Now on that occasion the Venerable Nāgita was the Blessed One’s attendant. The Blessed One addressed the Venerable Nāgita: “Who is making such an uproar and a racket, Nāgita? One would think it was fishermen at a haul of fish.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p99 href=#p99>99</a></span>“Bhante, these are the brahmin householders of Icchānaṅgala who have brought abundant food of various kinds. They are standing outside the entrance, [wishing to offer it] to the Blessed One and the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.”</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p130 href=#p130>130</a></span>The Blessed One consented by silence. Then Uggaha, having understood that the Blessed One had consented, rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p131 href=#p131>131</a></span>Then, when the night had passed, in the morning the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to Uggaha’s residence, where he sat down on the appointed seat.

Let the Blessed One exhort them and instruct them in a way that will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time.”</p>
<p id="calibre_link-5394" class="calibre21">The Blessed One then said to those girls:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p133 href=#p133>133</a></span>(1) “So then, girls, you should train yourselves thus: ‘To whichever husband our parents give us—doing so out of a desire for our good, seeking our welfare, taking compassion on us, acting out of compassion for us—we will rise before him and retire after him, undertaking whatever needs to be done, agreeable in our conduct and pleasing in our speech.’ Thus should you train yourselves.</p>

It is uncertain whether they are called thus in the sense that their bodies are agreeable, or in the sense that they belong to an agreeable group. The word <em>kāya</em> can mean either the physical body or a group.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p250 href=#p250>250</a></span>On one occasion the Venerable Nārada was dwelling at Pāṭaliputta at the Cock’s Park. Now on that occasion King Muṇḍa’s [wife] Queen Bhaddā, who had been dear and beloved to him, had died. Since her death, he did not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work. Day and night, he remained brooding over Queen Bhaddā’s body. Then King Muṇḍa addressed his treasurer, Piyaka: “Well then, friend Piyaka, [58] immerse Queen Bhaddā’s body in an iron vat filled with oil and enclose it in another iron vat so that we can see Queen Bhaddā’s body still longer.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p251 href=#p251>251</a></span>“Yes, sire,” the treasurer Piyaka replied. Then he immersed Queen Bhaddā’s body in an iron vat filled with oil and enclosed it in another iron vat.</p>

Since her death, he does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work. Day and night, he remains brooding over the queen’s body. What ascetic or brahmin can King Muṇḍa visit, so that, having heard his Dhamma, he might abandon the dart of sorrow?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p253 href=#p253>253</a></span>Then it occurred to Piyaka: “The Venerable Nārada is dwelling at Pāṭaliputta, in the Cock’s Park.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p254 href=#p254>254</a></span>Then the treasurer Piyaka approached King Muṇḍa and said to him: “Sire, the Venerable Nārada is dwelling at Pāṭaliputta, in the Cock’s Park. Now a good report about this Venerable Nārada has circulated thus: ‘He is wise … and an arahant.’ Your majesty should visit the Venerable Nārada. Perhaps, when you hear the Venerable Nārada’s Dhamma, you would abandon the dart of sorrow.” [The king said:] “Well then, friend Piyaka, [59] inform the Venerable Nārada.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p255 href=#p255>255</a></span>“Yes, sire,” Piyaka replied. Then he went to the Venerable Nārada, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Bhante, King Muṇḍa’s [wife] Queen Bhaddā, who was dear and beloved to him, has died. Since the queen’s death, he does not bathe, anoint himself, eat his meals, or undertake his work. Day and night, he remains brooding over the queen’s body.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p257 href=#p257>257</a></span>Then the treasurer Piyaka rose from his seat, paid homage to the Venerable Nārada, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and went to King Muṇḍa.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p258 href=#p258>258</a></span>“Well then, friend Piyaka, get the finest carriages harnessed!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p259 href=#p259>259</a></span>“Yes, sire,” Piyaka replied, and after he had gotten the finest carriages harnessed he told King Muṇḍa: “Sire, the finest carriages have been harnessed. You may go at your own convenience.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p260 href=#p260>260</a></span>Then King Muṇḍa mounted a fine carriage, and along with the other carriages he set out in full royal splendor for the Cock’s Park to see the Venerable Nārada. He went by carriage as far as the ground was suitable for a carriage, and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the park on foot. He approached the Venerable Nārada, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. [60] The Venerable Nārada then said to him:</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p267 href=#p267>267</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p268 href=#p268>268</a></span>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

(1) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.’ (2) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness.’ (3) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death.’ (4) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect [72] thus: ‘I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me.’<span class=note><sup id=note1059>1059</sup><q><em>Sabbehi me piyehi manāpehi</em>. I use “everyone and everything” to cover both persons and possessions. The Pāli implies both, but in English we need two words to span both objects.</q></span> (5) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p311 href=#p311>311</a></span>(1) “For the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age’? In their youth beings are intoxicated with their youth, and when they are intoxicated with their youth they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with youth is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.’</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p312 href=#p312>312</a></span>(2) “And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness’?

You may go at your own convenience.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p673 href=#p673>673</a></span>Then the Licchavis approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. Standing there, they said to him: “Please, Bhante, let the Blessed One go to the Sārandada Shrine out of compassion.” The Blessed One silently consented. He went to the Sārandada Shrine, sat down on a seat that was prepared, and said to the Licchavis:</p>

(2) <em>Perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive</em> (<em>paṭikūle appaṭikūlasaññī</em>): He observes an undesirable object with loving-kindness or attends to it by way of elements. (3–4) In the third and fourth sections, he applies respectively the first and second methods to both kinds of objects. (5) <em>To dwell equanimous</em> (<em>upekkhako vihareyya</em>): this is the six-factored equanimity [that is, equanimity regarding the six sense objects] similar to that of an arahant. In this sutta, insight is explained in the five cases. It is possible for a bhikkhu who has initiated insight to do this; it is also possible for a knowledgeable, wise, and learned person to do this.

He would press it down with his left foot, spread it out with his right foot, tear off an intact section, and take it away with him; so too, when a person’s bodily behavior is impure but his verbal behavior is pure, on that occasion one should not attend to the impurity of his bodily behavior but should instead attend to the purity of his verbal behavior. In this way resentment toward that person should be removed.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p755 href=#p755>755</a></span>(2) “How, friends, should resentment be removed toward the person whose verbal behavior is impure but whose bodily behavior is pure? Suppose there is a pond covered with algae and water plants. A man might arrive, afflicted and oppressed by the heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. He would plunge into the pond, sweep away the algae and water plants with his hands, drink from his cupped hands, and then leave; so too, [188] when a person’s verbal behavior is impure but his bodily behavior is pure, on that occasion one should not attend to the impurity of his verbal behavior but should instead attend to the purity of his bodily behavior.

Suppose there is a little water in a puddle. Then a person might arrive, afflicted and oppressed by the heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. He would think: ‘This little bit of water is in the puddle. If I try to drink it with my cupped hands or a vessel, I will stir it up, disturb it, and make it undrinkable. Let me get down on all fours, suck it up like a cow, and depart.’ He then gets down on all fours, sucks the water up like a cow, and departs. So too, when a person’s bodily behavior and verbal behavior are impure but from time to time he gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, on that occasion one should not attend to the impurity of his bodily and verbal behavior, but should instead attend [189] to the opening of the mind, the placidity of mind, he gains from time to time.

Suppose a sick, afflicted, gravely ill person was traveling along a highway, and the last village behind him and the next village ahead of him were both far away. He would not obtain suitable food and medicine or a qualified attendant; he would not get [to meet] the leader of the village district. Another man traveling along the highway might see him and arouse sheer compassion, sympathy, and tender concern for him, thinking: ‘Oh, may this man obtain suitable food, suitable medicine, and a qualified attendant! May he get [to meet] the leader of the village district! For what reason? So that this man does not encounter calamity and disaster right here.’ So too, when a person’s bodily and verbal behavior are impure and he does not gain from time to time an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, on that occasion one should arouse sheer compassion, sympathy, and tender concern for him, thinking, ‘Oh, may this venerable one abandon bodily misbehavior and develop good bodily behavior; may he abandon verbal misbehavior and develop good verbal behavior; may he abandon mental misbehavior and develop good mental behavior! For what reason? So that, with the breakup of the body, after death, he will not be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.’ In this way resentment toward that person should be removed.

Then a man might arrive, afflicted and oppressed by the heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. Having plunged into the pond, he would bathe and drink, and then, after coming out, he would sit or lie down in the shade of a tree right there. So too, when a person’s bodily and verbal behavior are pure and from time to time he gains an opening of the mind, placidity of mind, on that occasion one should attend to his pure bodily behavior, to his pure verbal behavior, and to the opening of the mind, the placidity of mind, that he gains from time to time.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p766 href=#p766>766</a></span>When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Venerable Sāriputta: “This is impossible, friend Sāriputta, it cannot happen that a bhikkhu, having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] that transcend the company of devas that subsist on edible food, might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. There is no such possibility.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p767 href=#p767>767</a></span>A second time … A third time, [193] the Venerable Sāriputta said: “Here, friends, it is possible that a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior … having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] … might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p768 href=#p768>768</a></span>Then it occurred to the Venerable Sāriputta: “The Venerable Udāyī has rejected me up to the third time, and not a single bhikkhu expresses agreement with me. Let me approach the Blessed One.” Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and addressed the bhikkhus: “Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling.

<p id="calibre_link-6016" class="calibre21">A second time … A third time, the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus: “Here, friends, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior … [194] … having been reborn among a certain group of mind-made [deities] … might [again] enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p771 href=#p771>771</a></span>Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Udāyī: “Udāyī, just what do you understand by a mind-made group?”</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p774 href=#p774>774</a></span>Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, do you just look on passively as an elder bhikkhu is being harassed? Don’t you have any compassion toward an elder bhikkhu when he’s being harassed?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p775 href=#p775>775</a></span>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu accomplished in virtuous behavior, concentration, and wisdom might enter and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p776 href=#p776>776</a></span>Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Upavāṇa and said to him: “Here, friend Upavāṇa, they were harassing other elder bhikkhus, but we didn’t question them.<span class=note><sup id=note1162>1162</sup><q>I read with Ce and Ee <em>mayaṃ te na pucchāma</em>, as against Be <em>mayaṃ tena na muccāma</em>.</q></span> It would not be surprising <a id="calibre_link-5473"></a>if this evening, when he emerges from seclusion, the Blessed One makes a pronouncement about this matter, and he might call upon the Venerable Upavāṇa himself [to give an account].<span class=note><sup id=note1163>1163</sup><q><em>Yathā āyasmantaṃyev’ettha upavāṇaṃ paṭibhāseyya</em>.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p777 href=#p777>777</a></span>Then, in the evening, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and went to the meeting hall. He sat down in the appointed seat and said to the Venerable Upavāṇa:</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p801 href=#p801>801</a></span>On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p803 href=#p803>803</a></span>“(1) There is, friend, Brahmā, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of power.

They sometimes utter the inspired utterance: ‘Oh, what happiness! Oh, what happiness!’ Getting to hear that sound is the foremost kind of hearing. (3) There are the devas of refulgent glory.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p807 href=#p807>807</a></span>“Yes, friend,” the Venerable Bhaddaji replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:</p>

But such conduct also awakens in others <em>trust</em> in oneself as a spiritually refined person and inspires <em>confidence</em> in the teaching one follows.
