It seems that the point in expressing this in terms of <em>dhammā</em>, which I here render “stages,” is to show that this process of development unfolds in accordance with natural principles as one stage conditions the arising of the subsequent stage all the way from the beginning of the path to its culmination. This series thus constitutes a “positive” version of dependent origination. We meet this positive version in the Upanisā Sutta (SN <a class=seesutta href=SN12.html#s23>12:23</a>, II 29–32).

The attainment, as shown in this sutta, does not take any of the mundane, conditioned meditation objects as its support; its support is the unconditioned nibbāna, experienced directly and immediately.

<h3><a id=s25 href=#m25>25 (5) Kasiṇas</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p191 href=#p191>191</a></span>“Bhikkhus, there are these ten <em>kasiṇa</em> bases.<span class=note><sup id=note1995>1995</sup><q><em>Kasiṇāyatanāni</em>. The <em>kasiṇas</em> are disks representing elements or colors used as objects of <em>samādhi</em> meditation. For example, the earth <em>kasiṇa</em> is a disk filled with reddish brown clay; the water <em>kasiṇa</em> is a bowl of water; the color <em>kasiṇas</em> are colored disks. Though the meditator begins with a physical disk, when he can see the <em>kasiṇa</em> clearly with his mind’s eye, he discards the physical disk and focuses solely on the mental image. As concentration deepens, another image called the “counterpart mark” (<em>paṭibhāganimitta</em>) emerges as an anchor of attention. Vism chaps. 4 and 5 offer a detailed explanation of the <em>kasiṇas</em>. In the Vism system, the space <em>kasiṇa</em> (which was originally the base of the infinity of space) is replaced by the limited-space <em>kasiṇa</em>, and the consciousness <em>kasiṇa</em> by the light <em>kasiṇa</em>.</q></span> What ten? One person perceives the earth <em>kasiṇa</em> above, below, across, nondual, measureless.<span class=note><sup id=note1996>1996</sup><q>“Nondual” (<em>advaya</em>) here refers simply to the presentation of the object and not to an underlying ontological unity. Mp explains: “This is said because one [<em>kasiṇa</em>] does not acquire the quality of another. For just as, when one enters the water, there is only water and nothing else in all directions, so too, the earth <em>kasiṇa</em> is only the earth <em>kasiṇa</em>. It is unmixed with any other <em>kasiṇa</em>. The same method applies to the others.” On <em>appamāṇa</em>, “measureless,” Mp says: “This is stated by way of measureless pervasion of this or that [object]. For pervading it with the mind, one pervades the whole thing; one does not grasp boundaries, thinking: ‘This is its beginning, this is its middle.’”</q></span> One person perceives the water <em>kasiṇa</em> … the fire <em>kasiṇa</em> … the air <em>kasiṇa</em> … the blue <em>kasiṇa</em> … the yellow <em>kasiṇa</em> … the red <em>kasiṇa</em> … the white <em>kasiṇa</em> … the space <em>kasiṇa</em> … the consciousness <em>kasiṇa</em> above, below, across, nondual, measureless. These are the ten <em>kasiṇa</em> bases.”</p>

<h3><a id=s27 href=#m27>27 (7) Great Questions (1)</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p199 href=#p199>199</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, in the morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed, took their bowls and robes, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then it occurred to those bhikkhus: “It is still too early to walk for alms in Sāvatthī. Let us go to the park of the wanderers of other sects.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p200 href=#p200>200</a></span>Then those bhikkhus went to the park of the wanderers of other sects. They exchanged greetings with those wanderers and, when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, sat down to one side. Those wanderers then said to them:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p201 href=#p201>201</a></span>“Friends, the ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in such a way as this: ‘Come, bhikkhus, directly know all phenomena.<span class=note><sup id=note2001>2001</sup><q><em>Sabbaṃ dhammaṃ</em>. I understand the singular to be doing service for the plural <em>sabbe dhamme</em>.</q></span> Dwell having directly known all phenomena.’<span class=note><sup id=note2002>2002</sup><q>Ce and Ee <em>sabbaṃ dhammaṃ abhiññāya abhiññāya</em>. Be lacks the repetition.</q></span> We too teach the Dhamma to our disciples in such a way as this: ‘Come, friends, directly know all phenomena. Dwell having directly known all phenomena.’ What now is the distinction, the disparity, the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s [49] teaching of the Dhamma and our teaching, between his instruction and our instruction?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p202 href=#p202>202</a></span>Then those bhikkhus neither applauded nor rejected the statement of those wanderers. Without applauding it, without rejecting it, they rose from their seats and left, [thinking]: “We shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statement.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p203 href=#p203>203</a></span>Then, when those bhikkhus had walked for alms in Sāvatthī, after their meal, on returning from their alms round, they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Here, Bhante, in the morning, we dressed, took our bowls and robes, and entered Sāvatthī for alms…. [They here report the entire course of events, down to:] [50] We rose from our seats and left, [thinking]: ‘We shall find out what the Blessed One has to say about this statement.’”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p204 href=#p204>204</a></span>“Bhikkhus, when wanderers of other sects speak thus, they should be answered in this way: ‘A question about one, a concise statement about one, an explanation of one.<span class=note><sup id=note2003>2003</sup><q>Despite the grammatical form of the sentences, I believe that this rendering does better justice to the sense than a literal translation, “One question, one concise statement, one explanation.” The “twos” and higher numbers do not present “two questions, etc.,” “three questions, etc.,” and so forth, but a question <em>about</em> two items, a question <em>about</em> three items, and so forth.</q></span> A question about two, a concise statement about two, an explanation of two. A question about three, a concise statement about three, an explanation of three. A question about four, a concise statement about four, an explanation of four.

A question about nine, a concise statement about nine, an explanation of nine. A question about ten, a concise statement about ten, an explanation of ten. If wanderers of other sects were questioned thus, they would not be able to reply and, further, they would meet with distress. For what reason? Because that would not be within their domain. I do not see anyone, bhikkhus, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, who could satisfy the mind with an answer to these questions apart from the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata or one who has heard it from them.</p>

The Pāli version is more cogent with respect to certain items, particularly the fours, fives, sixes, and tens; here EĀ 46.8 has the four noble truths, the five spiritual faculties, the six principles of communal harmony, and the ten kinds of mindfulness (the six recollections, mindfulness of the body, of death, of breathing, and of peace). EĀ 46.8 provides explanations of the items in each group, which calls our attention to what is missing in the Pāli version. While the Pāli version announces three categories for each number—the question (<em>pañha</em>), the concise statement (<em>uddesa</em>), and the explanation (<em>veyyākaraṇa</em>)—the sutta presents only two, the question and the concise statement, but not the explanation. The Kumārapañha section of the Khuddakapāṭha (§4) partly overlaps this list, but since the latter simply lists items to be remembered, without reference to disenchantment and dispassion, it includes positive sets: the four noble truths, the seven enlightenment factors, the eightfold path, and the ten factors of an arahant.</q></span> When a bhikkhu is completely disenchanted with one thing, completely dispassionate toward it, completely liberated from it, completely sees its delimitations, and completely breaks through its meaning, in this very life he makes an end of suffering.

Of these, the two most relevant here are the castrated male (<em>opakkamikapaṇḍaka</em>) and the person born sexually indeterminate (<em>napuṃsakapaṇḍaka</em>). A parallel of this distinction can be found in Matthew 19:12 (English Standard Version): “For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.” The first correspond to the <em>napuṃsakas</em>, the second to the <em>opakkamikas</em>, and the third perhaps to those who choose celibacy (or castrate themselves) for religious reasons.</q></span> (8) a discussion about a eunuch is underway; (9) a seducer of a bhikkhunī is sitting in that assembly;<span class=note><sup id=note2034>2034</sup><q>The implications of <em>bhikkhunidūsaka</em> are not spelled out in the canonical texts themselves. However, the Vinayavinicchaya-ṭīkā I 121 (VRI ed.; Be §322) defines the term in a way that applies to a bhikkhu who has had sexual intercourse of any kind with a bhikkhunī: “One is said to be a <em>bhikkhunidūsaka</em> when one has defiled a bhikkhunī in good standing by having sexual relations with her” (<em>dūsako ti pakatattāya bhikkhuniyā methunaṃ paṭisevitvā tassā dūsitattā bhikkhuniṃ dūsetīti ‘‘bhikkhunidūsako’’ti vutto ca</em>).

The four main classes of Indian society in the Buddha’s time were referred to as <em>vaṇṇa</em>, lit., “color,” and thus the privative form, <em>vivaṇṇa</em>, should mean “without class” or “classless.” <em>Vevaṇṇiya</em> is the abstract noun, “classlessness,” implying that those who go forth give up their prior status as brahmin, khattiya, vessa, sudda, or outcast, and become known simply as ascetics following the Sakyan son (see <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN8.html#s19>8:19</a> §4</strong>). By the time of the commentaries the original meaning seems to have been forgotten, and thus Mp takes the word in the sense of “plain” or “without adornment”: “<em>Vevaṇṇiya</em> is twofold: with respect to body and with respect to articles of use. <em>Vevaṇṇiya</em> with respect to body means shaving off the hair and beard. <em>Vevaṇṇiya</em> with respect to articles of use means wearing ochre robes made from stitched-together pieces of cloth; eating food mixed together with water in an iron or clay bowl; sleeping at the foot of a tree, etc., and lying down on mats made of reeds and grass, etc.; sitting on a strip of leather or cloth, etc.; and using fermented cow’s urine, etc., for medicine. When one reflects thus, anger and conceit are abandoned.”</q></span></p>

But <em>niṭṭhā</em> also means goal, namely, arahantship. Thus reaching certainty about the Buddha marks the attainment of stream-entry (or higher stages), while gaining the goal marks the attainment of arahantship. In the light of this distinction, Mp explains “gain the goal here in this world” (<em>idha niṭṭhā</em>) as “reach final nibbāna in this very world” (<em>imasmiṃyeva loke parinibbānaṃ</em>). “This world” (<em>idha</em>, lit., “here”) obviously means the sense sphere, since the stream-enterer and once-returner may reach the goal in a heavenly realm and not necessarily in the human realm. Mp says that “having left this world” (<em>idha vihāya</em>) means “in the pure abodes of the brahmā world (<em>suddhāvāsabrahmalokaṃ</em>).”</q></span> five gain the goal having left this world.</p>

<h3><a id=s72 href=#m72>72 (2) Thorns</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p560 href=#p560>560</a></span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood together with a number of very well-known elder disciples: the Venerable Cāla, the Venerable Upacāla, the Venerable Kakkaṭa, the Venerable Kaṭimbha, the Venerable Kaṭa, the Venerable Kaṭissaṅga, and other very well-known elder disciples.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p561 href=#p561>561</a></span>Now on that occasion a number of very well-known Licchavis had entered the Great Wood in order to see the Blessed One, and as they followed one another in their finest carriages they made an uproar and a racket. It then occurred to those venerable ones: “A number of very well-known Licchavis have entered the Great Wood in order to see the Blessed One, and as they follow one another in their finest carriages they are making an uproar and a racket. Now the Blessed One has called noise a thorn to the jhānas. Let us go to the Gosiṅga Sal Woods. [134] There we can dwell at ease, without noise and without any crowds.” Then those venerable ones went to the Gosiṅga Sal Woods, where they dwelt at ease, without noise and crowds.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p562 href=#p562>562</a></span>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, where is Cāla? Where is Upacāla? Where is Kakkaṭa? Where is Kaṭimbha? Where is Kaṭa? Where is Kaṭissaṅga? Where have those elder disciples gone?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p563 href=#p563>563</a></span>“Bhante, it occurred to those venerable ones: ‘A number of very well-known Licchavis … are making an uproar and a racket….

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p564 href=#p564>564</a></span>“Good, good, bhikkhus! Those great disciples spoke rightly when they said that I have called noise a thorn to the jhānas. There are, bhikkhus, these ten thorns. What ten? (1) Delight in company is a thorn to one who delights in solitude. (2) Pursuit of an attractive object is a thorn to one intent on meditation on the mark of the unattractive. (3) An unsuitable show is a thorn to one guarding the doors of the sense faculties. (4) Keeping company with women is a thorn to the celibate life. [135] (5) Noise is a thorn to the first jhāna. (6) Thought and examination are a thorn to the second jhāna. (7) Rapture is a thorn to the <a id="calibre_link-5598"></a>third jhāna. (8) In-and-out breathing is a thorn to the fourth jhāna. (9) Perception and feeling are a thorn to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling. (10) Lust is a thorn, hatred is a thorn, and delusion is a thorn. Dwell thornless, bhikkhus! Dwell without thorns! The arahants are thornless. The arahants are without thorns. The arahants are thornless and without thorns.”</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p574 href=#p574>574</a></span>Then, when the Venerable Ānanda had received almsfood at Migasālā’s house, he rose from his seat and departed.

Because a worldling can have extremely wholesome virtuous behavior, but the path of arahantship leads to the destruction of wholesome and unwholesome kamma; thus it is broken in that way.” This, it should be pointed out, is explained from the Abhidhamma standpoint, according to which an arahant’s actions, being mere activities (<em>kiriya</em>) without kammic result, are not classified as either wholesome or unwholesome.

<h3><a id=s86 href=#m86>86 (6) Final Knowledge</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p666 href=#p666>666</a></span>On one occasion the Venerable Mahākassapa was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. There the Venerable [162] Mahākassapa addressed the bhikkhus: “Friends, bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p667 href=#p667>667</a></span>“Friend,” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahākassapa said this:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p668 href=#p668>668</a></span>“Here, friends, a bhikkhu declares final knowledge thus: ‘I understand: “Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.”’ The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer—skilled in attainment, skilled in others’ minds, skilled in the ways of others’ minds—questions him, interrogates him, and cross-examines him. When he is being questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined by the Tathāgata or his disciple, he comes to an impasse and is flustered. He meets with calamity, meets with disaster, meets with calamity and disaster.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p669 href=#p669>669</a></span>“The Tathāgata or his disciple who is a jhāna-attainer … encompasses his mind with his own mind and considers: ‘Why does this venerable one declare final knowledge thus: “I understand: ‘Destroyed is birth … there is no more coming back to any state of being’”?’ The Tathāgata or his disciple, having encompassed his mind with his own mind, understands: ‘This venerable one overestimates himself, imagines that his estimate of himself is valid, thinks that he has attained what he has not attained, accomplished what he has not accomplished, and achieved what he has not achieved, and by overestimation of himself he declares final knowledge <a id="calibre_link-5369"></a>thus: “I understand: ‘Destroyed is birth … there is no more coming back to any state of being.’”’</p>

When a bhikkhu is a maker of disciplinary issues and does not speak in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues, this is a quality that does not lead to affection, respect, esteem, accord, or unity.<span class=note><sup id=note2106>2106</sup><q><em>Ayampi dhammo na piyatāya na garutāya na bhāvanāya na sāmaññāya na ekībhāvāya saṃvattati</em>. Mp glosses <em><strong>na sāmaññāya</strong></em> with <em>na samaṇadhammabhāvāya</em> “nor to the state [or duty] of an ascetic.” Mp obviously takes <em>sāmañña</em> to be derived from <em>samaṇa</em>. However, the word <em>sāmaññā</em> is also an abstract noun from <em>samāna</em>, meaning “the same” or “similar,” and I believe this is the sense intended here. I translate it as “accord,” which agrees well with the next word, <em>ekībhāvāya</em>. See too <a class=seenote href=AN8.html#note1623>AN8, note 1623</a>. Mp does not gloss <em>bhāvanāya</em>, but in commenting on <strong><a class=seesutta href=AN8.html#s2>8:2</a></strong> it allows two alternatives, “meditative development” and “esteem for virtues.” In this context I have taken the latter to be intended. A Chinese parallel, MĀ 94, at T I 576a<small>23–25</small>, has for <em>bhāvanāya,</em> <img src="images/000011.jpg" class="calibre125">, “nor to meditative development”; and for <em>sāmaññā,</em> <img src="images/000056.jpg" class="calibre126">, “nor to obtaining the ascetic state.” Despite this agreement between Mp and MĀ 94, I still think it possible that the words were misunderstood at an early period and prefer my rendering.</q></span> [165]</p>

In this manner the Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesamum seed might be depleted and eliminated more quickly than (1) a life in a single <em>abbuda</em> hell would go by.

Some intelligent people here understand the meaning of what is said by means of a simile. Suppose a king had a frontier city with strong ramparts, walls, and arches, and with a single gate. The gatekeeper posted there would be wise, competent, and intelligent; one who keeps out strangers [195] and admits acquaintances. While he is walking along the path that encircles the city he would not see a cleft or an opening in the walls even big enough for a cat to slip through. He might not know how many living beings enter or leave the city, but he could be sure that whatever large living beings enter or leave the city all enter and leave through that gate. So too, friend Uttiya, the Tathāgata has no concern whether the entire world will be emancipated, or half the world, or a third of the world. But he can be sure that all those who have been emancipated, or who are being emancipated, or who will be emancipated from the world first abandon the five hindrances, corruptions of the mind that weaken wisdom, and then, with their minds well established in the four establishments of mindfulness, develop correctly the seven factors of enlightenment.

<h3><a id=s174 href=#m174>174 (8) Causes of Kamma</a></h3>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1156 href=#p1156>1156</a></span>“Bhikkhus, the destruction of life, I say, is threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Taking what is not given, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Sexual misconduct, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. False speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Divisive speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Harsh speech, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Idle chatter, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Longing, [262] I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Ill will, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Wrong view, I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and caused by delusion.</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1157 href=#p1157>1157</a></span>“Thus, bhikkhus, greed is a source and origin of kamma; hatred is a source and origin of kamma; delusion is a source and origin of kamma.

With the destruction of delusion, a source of kamma is extinguished.”</p>

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1161 href=#p1161>1161</a></span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Pāvā in the mango grove of Cunda, the smith’s son.<span class=note><sup id=note2165>2165</sup><q>It was this Cunda that offered the Buddha his final meal. See DN 16.4.17–19, II 127.</q></span> Then Cunda, the smith’s son, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1162 href=#p1162>1162</a></span>“Cunda, whose rites of purity<span class=note><sup id=note2166>2166</sup><q><em>Soceyyāni</em>.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1163 href=#p1163>1163</a></span>“Bhante, I prefer the rites of purity prescribed by the brahmins of the west who carry around waterpots, wear garlands of water plants, tend the sacred fire, and immerse themselves in water.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1164 href=#p1164>1164</a></span>“And how, Cunda, do the brahmins of the west prescribe their rites of purity?”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1165 href=#p1165>1165</a></span>“Here, Bhante, the brahmins of the west enjoin a disciple thus: ‘Come, good man, having gotten up early, you should stroke the ground from your bed. If you don’t stroke the ground, you should stroke wet cow dung. If you don’t stroke wet cow dung, you should stroke green grass. If you don’t stroke green grass, you should tend the sacred fire. If you don’t tend the sacred fire, you should pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation. If you don’t pay homage to the sun with reverential salutation, you should immerse yourself in water three times including the evening.’ It is in this way that the brahmins of the west prescribe their rites of purity. It is their rites of purity that I prefer.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1166 href=#p1166>1166</a></span>“Cunda, purification in the Noble One’s discipline is quite different from the rites of purity prescribed by the brahmins of the west who carry around waterpots, wear garlands of water plants, tend the sacred fire, and immerse themselves in water.” [264]</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1167 href=#p1167>1167</a></span>“But how, Bhante, does purification come about in the Noble <a id="calibre_link-5937"></a>One’s discipline?

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1169 href=#p1169>1169</a></span>“Yes, Bhante,” Cunda, the smith’s son, replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

Out of deference to established English usage, I have used the singular “kamma.” In view of the fact that <em>kamma</em> is by definition volitional (<em>cetanā ‘haṃ bhikkhave kammaṃ vadāmi</em>), “volitional kamma” sounds redundant, but I follow the Pāli. Apparently the text is playing off two meanings of <em>kamma</em>, the literal meaning of “deed, action” and the extended meaning of a deed with the capacity to produce ethically determined fruits. The former meaning, perhaps, is accentuated by <em>kata</em>, “done,” the latter by <em>upacita</em>, “accumulated, stored up” as well as by the reference to the time periods when it can ripen.</q></span> that has been done and accumulated so long as one has not experienced [its results], and that may be in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.

<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1338 href=#p1338>1338</a></span>“What do you think, bhikkhus, if a youth were to develop the liberation of mind by loving-kindness from his childhood on, would he do a bad deed?”<span class=note><sup id=note2187>2187</sup><q>As pointed out earlier, the Pāli word <em>kamma</em> bears two senses often difficult to distinguish: the etymological sense, simply an action or deed, and the soteriological sense, a deed considered as a moral force that can bring retributive consequences. It is strange that the text says unequivocally that one who develops the liberation of mind by loving-kindness can do no bad deed. It seems to me that although such a person might not commit bad deeds motivated by hatred and ill will, they could still do bad deeds, even minor ones, motivated by greed and delusion.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1339 href=#p1339>1339</a></span>“No, Bhante.”</p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1340 href=#p1340>1340</a></span>“Could suffering affect him if he does no bad deed?” “No, Bhante. For on what account could suffering affect one who does no bad deed?”<span class=note><sup id=note2188>2188</sup><q>This statement, too, seems counterintuitive. Those who do no bad deeds in this life certainly can suffer the kammic effects of bad deeds done in previous lives. Thus Moggallāna was assassinated and the Buddha himself was badly injured by a sharp stone that broke off from the boulder hurled at him by Devadatta. Virtuous people who are not arahants might also undergo psychological suffering, and not merely physical pain, as a consequence of undesirable situations. For example, Ānanda, a virtuous monk, felt grief and worry when the Buddha fell ill and Visākhā, a stream-enterer, lamented the death of her grandchild.</q></span></p>
<p><span class=pnum><a id=p1341 href=#p1341>1341</a></span>“A woman or a man should develop this liberation of mind by loving-kindness. A woman or a man cannot take this body with them when they go. Mortals have mind as their core.<span class=note><sup id=note2189>2189</sup><q><em>Cittantaro ayaṃ bhikkhave macco</em>.

This is the reflection of a noble person who is a stream-enterer or a once-returner.” Presumably, the bad kamma is all to be experienced here (<em>sabbaṃ taṃ idha vedanīyaṃ</em>), in this life, and will not follow along (<em>na taṃ anugaṃ bhavissati</em>) because his next rebirth will be in the form realm, where there is no painful experience, and he will attain nibbāna in the form realm without returning to this world.</q></span> When the liberation of mind by loving-kindness has been developed in this way, it leads to non-returning for a wise bhikkhu here<span class=note><sup id=note2192>2192</sup><q><em>Idha paññassa bhikkhuno uttariṃ vimuttiṃ appaṭivijjhato</em>. Mp: “<em>A wise bhikkhu here</em>: The wisdom in this teaching is called ‘wisdom here.’ The meaning [of a wise one here] is a noble disciple who is settled in the noble wisdom that pertains to the teaching” (<em>imasmiṃ sāsane paññā idhapaññā nāma, sāsanacaritāya ariyapaññāya ṭhitassa ariyasāvakassā ti attho</em>).</q></span> who does not penetrate to a further liberation.<span class=note><sup id=note2193>2193</sup><q>Mp calls this the state of a “jhāna non-returner” (<em>jhānānāgāmitā</em>). Such persons have realized the lower two fruits and attained the jhānas, but have not yet really reached the stage of non-returner. By the karmic power of their jhānas they will be reborn in the form realm, where they will attain the higher two paths and fruits without ever returning to the sense sphere; thus they are called “jhāna non-returners.” The “further liberation” (<em>uttariṃ vimutti</em>) is arahantship. See too <a class=seenote href=AN3.html#note539>AN3, note 539</a>.</q></span></p>

Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will.
