53. Sekha Sutta - The Disciple in Higher Training</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a new assembly hall had recently been built for
the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu and it had not yet been inhabited by any
recluse or brahmin or human being at all. Then the Sakyans of
Kapilavatthu went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him,
they sat down at one side and said to him:</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, a new assembly hall has recently been built here for the Sakyans
of Kapilavatthu and it has not yet been inhabited by any recluse or
brahmin or human being at all. Venerable sir, let the Blessed One be
the first to use it. When the Blessed One has used it first, then the
Sakyans of Kapilavatthu will use it afterwards. That will lead to
their welfare and happiness for a long time."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote557anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote557sym"><SUP>dlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
[354]</P>
<P  >3.
The Blessed One consented in silence. Then, when they saw that he had
consented, they got up from their seats, and after paying homage to
him, keeping him on their right, they went to the assembly hall. They
covered it completely with coverings and prepared seats, and they put
out a large water jug and hung up an oil-lamp. Then they went to the
Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they stood at one side
and said:</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, the assembly hall has been covered completely with coverings and
seats have been prepared, a large water jug has been put out and an
oil-lamp hung up. Now is the time for the Blessed One to do as he
thinks fit."</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he
went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the assembly hall. When he
arrived, he washed his feet and then entered the hall and sat down by
the central pillar facing the east. And the bhikkhus washed their
feet and then entered the hall and sat down by the western wall
facing the east, with the Blessed One before them. And the Sakyans of
Kapilavatthu washed their feet and entered the hall and sat down by
the eastern wall facing the west, with the Blessed One before them.</P>
<P  >5.
Then, when the Blessed One had instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu with talk on the Dhamma for
much of the night, he said to the venerable Ananda: "Ananda, speak
to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the disciple in higher training
who has entered upon the way.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote558anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote558sym"><SUP>dlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
My back is uncomfortable. I will rest it."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," the venerable Ananda replied.</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One prepared his patchwork cloak folded in four and lay
down on his right side in the lion's pose, with one foot
overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in his
mind the time for rising.</P>
<P  >6.
Then the venerable Ananda addressed Mahanama the Sakyan thus:</P>
<P  >"Mahanama,
here a noble disciple is possessed of virtue, guards the doors of his
sense faculties, is moderate in eating, and devoted to wakefulness;
he possesses seven good qualities; and he is one who obtains at will,
without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that constitute the
higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now. [355]</P>
<P  >7.
"And how is a noble disciple possessed of virtue? Here a noble
disciple is virtuous, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the
Patimokkha, he is perfect in conduct and resort, and seeing fear in
the slightest fault, he trains by undertaking the training precepts.
This is how a noble disciple is possessed of virtue.</P>
<P  >8.
"And how does a noble disciple guard the doors of his sense
faculties? On seeing a form with the eye, a noble disciple does not
grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty
unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might
invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye
faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a
sound with the ear ... On smelling an odour with the nose ... On
tasting a flavour with the tongue ... On touching a tangible with the
body ... on cognizing a mind-object with the mind, a noble disciple
does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the mind
faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief
might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards
the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty.
That is how a noble disciple guards the doors of his sense faculties.</P>
<P  >9.
"And how is a noble disciple moderate in eating? Here, reflecting
wisely, a noble disciple takes food neither for amusement nor for
intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness,
but only for the endurance and continuance of this body, for ending
discomfort, and for assisting the holy life, considering: 'Thus I
shall terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I
shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort.' That is
how a noble disciple is moderate in eating.</P>
<P  >10.
"And how is a noble disciple devoted to wakefulness? Here, during
the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, a noble disciple
purifies his mind of obstructive states. In the first watch of the
night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind
of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night he lies down
on the right side in the lion's pose with one foot overlapping the
other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in his mind the time for
rising. After rising, in the third watch of the night, while walking
back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive
states. That is how a noble disciple is devoted to wakefulness. [356]</P>
<P  >11.
"And how does a noble disciple possess seven good qualities? Here a
noble disciple has faith; he places his faith in the Tathagata's
enlightenment thus: 'The Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.'</P>
<P  >12.
"He has shame; he is ashamed of misconduct in body, speech, and
mind, ashamed of engaging in evil unwholesome deeds.</P>
<P  >13.
"He has fear of wrongdoing; he is afraid of misconduct in body,
speech, and mind, afraid of engaging in evil unwhole some deeds.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote559anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote559sym"><SUP>dlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
"He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and
consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as are good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right
meaning and phrasing, and affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect
and pure - such teachings as these he has learned much of,
remembered, recited verbally, investigated with the mind and
penetrated well by view.</P>
<P  >15.
"He is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in
undertaking wholesome states; he is steadfast, firm in striving, not
remiss in developing wholesome states.</P>
<P  >16.
"He has mindfulness; he possesses the highest mindfulness and
skill; he recalls and recollects what was done long ago and spoken
long ago.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote560anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote560sym"><SUP>dlx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >17.
"He is wise; he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance
that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction
of suffering.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote561anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote561sym"><SUP>dlxi</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how a noble disciple possesses seven good qualities.</P>
<P  >18.
"And how is a noble disciple one who obtains at will, without
trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that constitute the higher
mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now? Here, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a
noble disciple enters upon and abides in the first jhana ... With the
stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon and abides
in the second jhana ... With the fading away as well of rapture ...
he enters upon and abides in the third jhana ... With the abandoning
of pleasure and pain ... he enters upon and abides in the fourth
jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness
due to equanimity. That is how a noble disciple is one who obtains at
will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that constitute
the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now.</P>
<P  >19.
"When a noble disciple has thus become one who is possessed of
virtue, who guards the doors of his sense faculties, who is moderate
in eating, who is devoted to wakefulness, who possesses seven good
qualities, [357] who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty,
the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a
pleasant abiding here and now, he is called one in higher training
who has entered upon the way. His eggs are unspoiled; he is capable
of breaking out, capable of enlightenment, capable of attaining the
supreme security from bondage.</P>
<P  >"Suppose
there were a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs, which she had
covered, incubated, and nurtured properly.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote562anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote562sym"><SUP>dlxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Even
though she did not wish: 'Oh, that my chicks might pierce their
shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatch out
safely!' yet the chicks are capable of piercing their shells with
the points of their claws and beaks and hatching out safely. So too,
when a noble disciple has thus become one who is possessed of virtue
... he is called one in higher training who has entered upon the way.
His eggs are unspoiled; he is capable of breaking out, capable of
enlightenment, capable of attaining the supreme security from
bondage.</P>
<P  >20.
"Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is
due to equanimity,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote563anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote563sym"><SUP>dlxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
this noble disciple recollects his manifold past lives ... (as Sutta
51, §24) ... Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects
his manifold past lives. This is his first breaking out like that of
the hen's chicks from their shells.</P>
<P  >21.
"Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is
due to equanimity, with the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, this noble disciple sees beings passing away and
reappearing ... (as Sutta 51, §25) ... he understands how beings
pass on according to their actions. This is his second breaking out
like that of the hen's chicks from their shells.</P>
<P  >22.
"Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is
due to equanimity, by realising for himself with direct knowledge,
this noble disciple here and now enters upon and abides in the
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with
the destruction of the taints. [358] This is his third breaking out
like that of the hen's chicks from their shells.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote564anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote564sym"><SUP>dlxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
"When a noble disciple is possessed of virtue, that is his conduct.
When he guards the doors of his sense faculties, that is his conduct.
When he is moderate in eating, that is his conduct. When he is
devoted to wakefulness, that is his conduct. When he possesses seven
good qualities, that is his conduct. When he is one who obtains at
will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that constitute
the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now, that is
his conduct.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote565anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote565sym"><SUP>dlxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >24.
"When he recollects his manifold past lives ... with their aspects
and particulars, that is his true knowledge. When, with the divine
eye ... he sees beings passing away and reappearing and understands
how beings pass on according to their actions, that is his true
knowledge. When, by realising for himself with</P>
<P  >direct
knowledge, he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance
of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the
destruction of the taints, that is his true knowledge.</P>
<P  >25.
"This noble disciple is thus said to be perfect in true knowledge,
perfect in conduct, perfect in true knowledge and conduct. And this
stanza was uttered by the Brahma Sanankumara:</P>
<P >
'The noble clan is held to be</P>
<P >
The best of people as to lineage;</P>
<P >
But best of gods and humans is one</P>
<P >
Perfect in true knowledge and conduct.'</P>
<P  >"Now
that stanza was well sung by the Brahma Sanankumara, not ill-sung; it
was well spoken, not ill-spoken; it has a meaning, and is not
meaningless; and it was approved by the Blessed One."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote566anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote566sym"><SUP>dlxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >26.
Then the Blessed One rose and addressed the venerable Ananda thus:
"Good, good, Ananda! It is good that you have spoken to the Sakyans
of Kapilavatthu about the disciple in higher training who has entered
upon the way." [359]</P>
<P  >That
is what the venerable Ananda said. The Teacher approved. The Sakyans
of Kapilavatthu were satisfied and delighted in the venerable
Ananda's words.</P>
