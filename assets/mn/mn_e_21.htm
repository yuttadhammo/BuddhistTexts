21. Kakacupama Sutta - The Simile of the Saw</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Moliya Phagguna was associating
overmuch with bhikkhunis.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote245anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote245sym"><SUP>ccxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
He was associating so much with bhikkhunis that if any bhikkhu spoke
dispraise of those bhikkhunis in his presence, he would become angry
and displeased and would rebuke him; and if any bhikkhu spoke
dispraise of the venerable Moliya Phagguna in those bhikkhunis'
presence, they would become angry and displeased and would rebuke
him. So much was the venerable Moliya Phagguna associating with
bhikkhunis.</P>
<P  >3.
Then a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what
was taking place.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: "Come, [123]
bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhu Moliya Phagguna in my name that the Teacher
calls him." - "Yes, venerable sir," he replied, and he went to
the venerable Moliya Phagguna and told him: "The Teacher calls you,
friend Phagguna." - "Yes, friend," he replied, and he went to
the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, sat down at one
side. The Blessed One asked him:</P>
<P  >5.
"Phagguna, is it true that you are associating overmuch with
bhikkhunis, that you are associating so much with bhikkhunis that if
any bhikkhu speaks dispraise of those bhikkhunis in your presence,
you become angry and displeased and rebuke him; and if any bhikkhu
speaks dispraise of you in those bhikkhunis' presence, they become
angry and displeased and rebuke him. Are you associating so much with
bhikkhunis, as it seems?" - "Yes, venerable sir." - "Phagguna,
are you not a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the home
life into homelessness?" - "Yes, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >6.
"Phagguna, it is not proper for you, a clansman gone forth out of
faith from the home life into homelessness, to associate overmuch
with bhikkhunis. Therefore, if anyone speaks dispraise of those
bhikkhunis in your presence, you should abandon any desires and any
thoughts based on the household life. And herein you should train
thus: 'My mind will be unaffected, and I shall utter no evil words;
I shall abide compassionate for his welfare, with a mind of
loving-kindness, without inner hate.' That is how you should train,
Phagguna.</P>
<P  >"If
anyone gives those bhikkhunis a blow with his hand, with a clod, with
a stick, or with a knife in your presence, you should abandon any
desires and any thoughts based on the household life. And herein you
should train thus: 'My mind will be unaffected ... ' If anyone
speaks dispraise in your presence, you should abandon any desires and
any thoughts based on the household life. And herein you should train
thus: 'My mind will be unaffected ... ' If anyone should give you
a blow with his hand, with a clod, with a stick, or with a knife,
[124] you should abandon any desires and any thoughts based on the
household life. And herein you should train thus: 'My mind will be
unaffected, and I shall utter no evil words; I shall abide
compassionate for his welfare, with a mind of loving-kindness,
without inner hate.' That is how you should train, Phagguna.</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, there
was an occasion when the bhikkhus satisfied my mind. Here I addressed
the bhikkhus thus: 'Bhikkhus, I eat at a single session. By so
doing, I am free from illness and affliction, and I enjoy health,
strength, and a comfortable abiding. Come, bhikkhus, eat at a single
session. By so doing, you will be free from illness and affliction,
and you will enjoy health, strength, and a comfortable abiding.'
And I had no need to keep on instructing those bhikkhus; I had only
to arouse mindfulness in them.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote246anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote246sym"><SUP>ccxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Suppose there were a chariot on even ground at the crossroads,
harnessed to thoroughbreds, waiting with goad lying ready, so that a
skilled trainer, a charioteer of horses to be tamed, might mount it,
and taking the reins in his left hand and the goad in his right hand,
might drive out and back by any road whenever he likes. So too, I had
no need to keep on instructing those bhikkhus; I had only to arouse
mindfulness in them.</P>
<P  >8.
"Therefore, bhikkhus, abandon what is unwholesome and devote
yourselves to wholesome states, for that is how you will come to
growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline.
Suppose there were a big sala-tree grove near a village or town, and
it was choked with castor-oil weeds, and some man would appear
desiring its good, welfare, and protection. He would cut down and
throw out the crooked saplings that robbed the sap, and he would
clean up the interior of the grove and tend the straight well-formed
saplings, so that the sala-tree grove later on would come to growth,
increase, and fulfilment. So too, bhikkhus, abandon what is
unwholesome and devote yourselves to wholesome states, [125] for that
is how you will come to growth, increase, and fulfilment in this
Dhamma and Discipline.</P>
<P  >9.
"Formerly, bhikkhus, in this same Savatthi there was a housewife
named Vedehika. And a good report about Mistress Vedehika had spread
thus: 'Mistress Vedehika is kind, Mistress Vedehika is gentle,
Mistress Vedehika is peaceful.' Now Mistress Vedehika had a maid
named Kali, who was clever, nimble, and neat in her work. The maid
Kali thought: 'A good report about my lady has spread thus:
"Mistress Vedehika is kind, Mistress Vedehika is gentle, Mistress
Vedehika is peaceful." How is it now, while she does not show
anger, is it nevertheless actually present in her or is it absent? Or
else is it just because my work is neat that my lady shows no anger
though it is actually present in her? Suppose I test my lady.'</P>
<P  >"So
the maid Kali got up late. The Mistress Vedehika said: 'Hey, Kali!'
- 'What is it, madam?' - 'What is the matter that you get up so
late?' - 'Nothing is the matter, madam.' - 'Nothing is the
matter, you wicked girl, yet you get up so late!' and she was angry
and displeased, and she scowled. Then the maid Kali thought: 'The
fact is that while my lady does not show anger, it is actually
present in her, not absent; and it is just because my work is neat
that my lady shows no anger though it is actually present in her, not
absent. Suppose I test my lady a little more.'</P>
<P  >"So
the maid Kali got up later in the day. Then Mistress Vedehika said:
'Hey, Kali!' - 'What is it, madam?' - 'What is the matter
that you get up later in the day?' -'Nothing is the matter,
madam.' - 'Nothing is the matter, you wicked girl, yet you get up
later in the day!' and she was angry and displeased, and she spoke
words of displeasure. Then the maid Karl thought: 'The fact is that
while my lady does not show anger, it is actually present in her, not
absent. Suppose I test my lady a little more.'</P>
<P  >"So
the maid Karl got up still later in the day. Then Mistress Vedehika
[126] said: 'Hey, Kali!' -'What is it, madam?' -'What is
the matter that you get up still later in the day?' - 'Nothing is
the matter, madam.' - 'Nothing is the matter, you wicked girl,
yet you get up still later in the day!' and she was angry and
displeased, and she took a rolling-pin, gave her a blow on the head,
and cut her head.</P>
<P  >"Then
the maid Kali, with blood running from her cut head, denounced her
mistress to the neighbours: 'See, ladies, the kind lady's work!
See, ladies, the gentle lady's work! See, ladies, the peaceful
lady's work! How can she become angry and displeased with her only
maid for getting up late? How can she take a rolling-pin, give her a
blow on the head, and cut her head?' Then later on a bad report
about Mistress Vedehika spread thus: 'Mistress Vedehika is rough,
Mistress Vedehika is violent, Mistress Vedehika is merciless.'</P>
<P  >10.
"So too, bhikkhus, some bhikkhu is extremely kind, extremely
gentle, extremely peaceful, so long as disagreeable courses of speech
do not touch him. But it is when disagreeable courses of speech touch
him that it can be understood whether that bhikkhu is really kind,
gentle, and peaceful. I do not call a bhikkhu easy to admonish who is
easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only for the sake
of getting robes, almsfood, a resting place, and medicinal
requisites. Why is that? Because that bhikkhu is not easy to admonish
nor makes himself easy to admonish when he gets no robes, almsfood,
resting place, and medicinal requisites. But when a bhikkhu is easy
to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish because he honours,
respects, and reveres the Dhamma, him I call easy to admonish.
Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'We shall be easy to
admonish and make ourselves easy to admonish because we honour,
respect, and revere the Dhamma.' That is how you should train,
bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >11.
"Bhikkhus, there are these five courses of speech that others may
use when they address you: their speech may be timely or untimely,
true or untrue, gentle or harsh, connected with good or with harm,
spoken with a mind of loving-kindness or with inner hate. When others
address you, their speech may be timely or untimely; when others
address you, their speech may be true or untrue; when others address
you, their speech may be gentle or harsh; when others address you,
their speech may be connected with good [127] or with harm; when
others address you, their speech may be spoken with a mind of
loving-kindness or with inner hate. Herein, bhikkhus, you. should
train thus: 'Our minds will remain unaffected, and we shall utter
no evil words; we shall abide compassionate for their welfare, with a
mind of loving-kindness, without inner hate. We shall abide pervading
that person with a mind imbued with lovingkindness, and starting with
him,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote247anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote247sym"><SUP>ccxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
we shall abide pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind
imbued with lovingkindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility and without ill will.' That is how you should train,
bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >12.
"Bhikkhus, suppose a man came with a hoe and a basket and said: 'I
shall make this great earth to be without earth.' He would dig here
and there, strew the soil here and there, spit here and there, and
urinate here and there, saying: 'Be without earth, be without
earth!' What do you think, bhikkhus? Could that man make this great
earth to be without earth?" - "No, venerable sir. Why is that?
Because this great earth is deep and immense; it cannot possibly be
made to be without earth. Eventually the man would reap only
weariness and disappointment."</P>
<P  >13.
"So too, bhikkhus, there are these five courses of speech ... (as
in §11) ... Herein, bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'Our minds
will remain unaffected ... and starting with him, we shall abide
pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind similar to the
earth, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without
ill will.' That is how you should train, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >14.
"Bhikkhus, suppose a man came with crimson, turmeric, indigo, or
carmine and said: 'I shall draw pictures and make pictures appear
on empty space.' What do you think, bhikkhus? Could that man draw
pictures and make pictures appear on empty space?" - "No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because empty space is formless and
invisible; he cannot possibly draw pictures there or make pictures
appear there. [128] Eventually the man would reap only weariness and
disappointment."</P>
<P  >15.
"So too, bhikkhus, there are these five courses of speech ...
Herein, bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'Our minds will remain
unaffected ... and starting with him, we shall abide pervading the
all-encompassing world with a mind similar to empty space, abundant,
exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will.'
That is how you should train, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >16.
"Bhikkhus, suppose a man came with a blazing grass-torch and said:
'I shall heat up and burn away the river Ganges with this blazing
grass-torch.' What do you think, bhikkhus? Could that man heat up
and burn away the river Ganges with that blazing grass-torch?" -
"No, venerable sir. Why is that? Because the river Ganges is deep
and immense; it cannot possibly be heated up and burned away with a
blazing grass-torch. Eventually the man would reap only weariness and
disappointment."</P>
<P  >17.
"So too, bhikkhus, there are these five courses of speech ...
Herein, bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'Our minds will remain
unaffected ... and starting with him, we shall abide pervading the
all-encompassing world with a mind similar to the river Ganges,
abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill
will.' That is how you should train, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >18.
"Bhikkhus, suppose there were a catskin bag that was rubbed,
well-rubbed, thoroughly well-rubbed, soft, silky, rid of rustling,
rid of crackling, and a man came with a stick or a potsherd and said:
'There is this catskin bag that is rubbed ... rid of rustling, rid
of crackling. I shall make it rustle and crackle.' What do you
think, bhikkhus? Could that man make it rustle or crackle with the
stick or the potsherd?" - "No, venerable sir. Why is that?
Because that catskin bag being rubbed ... rid of rustling, rid of
crackling, cannot possibly be made to rustle or crackle with the
stick or the potsherd. Eventually the man would reap only weariness
and disappointment."</P>
<P  >19.
"So too, bhikkhus, there are these five courses of speech that
others may use when they address you: their speech may be timely
[129] or untimely, true or untrue, gentle or harsh, connected with
good or with harm, spoken with a mind of lovingkindness or with inner
hate. When others address you, their speech may be timely or
untimely; when others address you, their speech may be true or
untrue; when others address you, their speech may be gentle or harsh;
when others address you, their speech may be connected with good or
with harm; when others address you, their speech may be spoken with a
mind of loving-kindness or with inner hate. Herein, bhikkhus, you
should train thus: 'Our minds will remain unaffected, and we shall
utter no evil words; we shall abide compassionate for their welfare,
with a mind of loving-kindness, without inner hate. We shall abide
pervading that person with a mind imbued with loving-kindness; and
starting with him, we shall abide pervading the all-encompassing
world with a mind similar to a catskin bag, abundant, exalted,
immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will.' That is how
you should train, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >20.
"Bhikkhus, even if bandits were to sever you savagely limb by limb
with a two-handled saw, he who gave rise to a mind of hate towards
them would not be carrying out my teaching. Herein, bhikkhus, you
should train thus: 'Our minds will remain unaffected, and we shall
utter no evil words; we shall abide compassionate for their welfare,
with a mind of lovingkindness, without inner hate. We shall abide
pervading them with a mind imbued with loving-kindness; and starting
with them, we shall abide pervading the all-encompassing world with a
mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable,
without hostility and without ill will.' That is how you should
train, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >21.
"Bhikkhus, if you keep this advice on the simile of the saw
constantly in mind, do you see any course of speech, trivial or
gross, that you could not endure?" - "No, venerable sir." -
"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should keep this advice on the simile of
the saw constantly in mind. That will lead to your welfare and
happiness for a long time."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
