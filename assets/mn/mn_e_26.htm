THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote297anc" HREF="#sdendnote297sym"><SUP>ccxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's
Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. Then a number of
bhikkhus went to the venerable Ananda and said to him: "Friend
Ananda, it is long since we heard a talk on the Dhamma from the
Blessed One's own lips. It would be good if we could get to hear
such a talk, friend Ananda." - "Then let the venerable ones go to
the brahmin Rammaka's hermitage. Perhaps you will get to hear a
talk on the Dhamma from the Blessed One's own lips." - "Yes,
friend," they replied.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when the Blessed One had wandered for alms in Savatthi and had
returned from his almsround, after his meal he addressed the
venerable Ananda: "Ananda, let us go to the Eastern Park, to the
Palace of Migara's Mother, for the day's abiding." - "Yes,
venerable sir," the venerable Ananda replied. [161] Then the
Blessed One went with the venerable Ananda to the Eastern Park, the
Palace of Migara's Mother, for the day's abiding.</P>
<P  >Then,
when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and
addressed the venerable Ananda: "Ananda, let us go to the Eastern
Bathing Place to bathe." - "Yes, venerable sir," the venerable
Ananda replied. Then the Blessed One went with the venerable Ananda
to the Eastern Bathing Place to bathe. When he was finished, he came
up out of the water and stood in one robe drying his limbs. Then the
venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, the
brahmin Rammaka's hermitage is nearby. That hermitage is agreeable
and delightful. Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One
went there out of compassion." The Blessed One consented in
silence.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One went to the brahmin Rammaka's hermitage. Now
on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were sitting together in the
hermitage discussing the Dhamma. The Blessed One stood outside the
door waiting for their discussion to end. When he knew that it was
over, he coughed and knocked, and the bhikkhus opened the door for
him. The Blessed One entered, sat down on a seat made ready, and
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, for what discussion are you
sitting together here now? And what was your discussion that was
interrupted?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, our discussion on the Dhamma that was interrupted was about the
Blessed One himself. Then the Blessed One arrived."</P>
<P  >"Good,
bhikkhus. It is fitting for you clansmen who have gone forth out of
faith from the home life into homelessness to sit together to discuss
the Dhamma. When you gather together, bhikkhus, you should do either
of two things: hold discussion on the Dhamma or maintain noble
silence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote298anc" HREF="#sdendnote298sym"><SUP>ccxcviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >TWO KINDS OF SEARCH</H3>
<P  >5.
"Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of search: the noble search
and the ignoble search. And what is the ignoble search? Here someone
being himself subject to birth seeks what is also subject to birth;
being himself subject to ageing, [162] he seeks what is also subject
to ageing; being himself subject to sickness, he seeks what is also
subject to sickness; being himself subject to death, he seeks what is
also subject to death; being himself subject to sorrow, he seeks what
is also subject to sorrow; being himself subject to defilement, he
seeks what is also subject to defilement.</P>
<P  >6.
"And what may be said to be subject to birth? Wife and children are
subject to birth, men and women slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and
pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, gold and silver are
subject to birth. These objects of attachment<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote299anc" HREF="#sdendnote299sym"><SUP>ccxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
are subject to birth; and one who is tied to these things, infatuated
with them, and utterly committed to them, being himself subject to
birth, seeks what it also subject to birth.</P>
<P  >7.
"And what may be said to be subject to ageing? Wife and children
are subject to ageing, men and women slaves, goats and sheep, fowl
and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, gold and silver are
subject to ageing. These objects of attachment are subject to ageing;
and one who is tied to these things, infatuated with them, and
utterly committed to them, being himself subject to ageing, seeks
what is also subject to ageing.</P>
<P  >8.
"And what may be said to be subject to sickness? Wife and children
are subject to sickness, men and women slaves, goats and sheep, fowl
and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares are subject to
sickness. These objects of attachment are subject to sickness; and
one who is tied to these things, infatuated with them, and utterly
committed to them, being himself subject to sickness, seeks what is
also subject to sickness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote300anc" HREF="#sdendnote300sym"><SUP>ccc</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9.
"And what may be said to be subject to death? Wife and children are
subject to death, men and women slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and
pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares are subject to death.
These objects of attachment are subject to death; and one who is tied
to these things, infatuated with them, and utterly committed to them,
being himself subject to death, seeks what is also subject to death.</P>
<P  >10.
"And what may be said to be subject to sorrow? Wife and children
are subject to sorrow, men and women slaves, goats and sheep, fowl
and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares are subject to sorrow.
These objects of attachment are subject to sorrow; and one who is
tied to these things, infatuated with them, and utterly committed to
them, being himself subject to sorrow, seeks what is also subject to
sorrow.</P>
<P  >11.
"And what may be said to be subject to defilement? Wife and
children are subject to defilement, men and women slaves, goats and
sheep, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, gold and
silver are subject to defilement. These objects of attachment are
subject to defilement; and one who is tied to these things,
infatuated with them, and utterly committed to them, being himself
subject to defilement, seeks what is also subject to defilement. This
is the ignoble search.</P>
<P  >12.
"And what is the noble search? Here someone being himself subject
to birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth,
[163] seeks the unborn supreme security from bondage, Nibbana; being
himself subject to ageing, having understood the danger in what is
subject to ageing, he seeks the unageing supreme security from
bondage, Nibbana; being</P>
<P  >himself
subject to sickness, having understood the danger in what is subject
to sickness, he seeks the unailing supreme security from bondage,
Nibbana; being himself subject to death, having understood the danger
in what is subject to death, he seeks the deathless supreme security
from bondage, Nibbana; being himself subject to sorrow, having
understood the danger in what is subject to sorrow, he seeks the
sorrowless supreme security from bondage, Nibbana; being himself
subject to defilement, having understood the danger in what is
subject to defilement, he seeks the undefiled supreme security from
bondage, Nibbana. This is the noble search.</P>
<H3 >(THE SEARCH FOR ENLIGHTENMENT)</H3>
<P  >13.
"Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an
unenlightened Bodhisatta, I too, being myself subject to birth,
sought what was also subject to birth; being myself subject to
ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, I sought what was
also subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement. Then
I considered thus: 'Why, being myself subject to birth, do I seek
what is also subject to birth? Why, being myself subject to ageing,
sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, do I seek what is also
subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement? Suppose
that, being myself subject to birth, having understood the danger in
what is subject to birth, I seek the unborn supreme security from
bondage, Nibbana. Suppose that, being myself subject to ageing,
sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, having understood the danger
in what is subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and
defilement, I seek the unageing, unailing, deathless, sorrowless, and
undefiled supreme security from bondage, Nibbana.'</P>
<P  >14.
"Later, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with
the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, though my mother and
father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces, I shaved off my
hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and went forth from the home
life into homelessness.</P>
<P  >15.
"Having gone forth, bhikkhus, in search of what is wholesome,
seeking the supreme state of sublime peace, I went to Alara Kalama
and said to him: 'Friend Kalama, I want to lead the holy life in
this Dhamma and Discipline.' Alara Kalama replied: 'The venerable
one may stay here. This Dhamma is such that a wise man [164] can soon
enter upon and abide in it, realising for himself through direct
knowledge his own teacher's doctrine.' I soon quickly learned
that Dhamma. As far as mere lip-reciting and rehearsal of his
teaching went, I could speak with knowledge and assurance, and I
claimed, 'I know and see' - and there were others who did
likewise.</P>
<P  >"I
considered: 'It is not through mere faith alone that Alara Kalama
declares: "By realising for myself with direct knowledge, I enter
upon and abide in this Dhamma." Certainly Alara Kalama abides
knowing and seeing this Dhamma.' Then I went to Alara Kalama and
asked him: 'Friend Kalama, in what way do you declare that by
realising for yourself with direct knowledge you enter upon and abide
in this Dhamma?' In reply he declared the base of nothingness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote301anc" HREF="#sdendnote301sym"><SUP>ccci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"I
considered: 'Not only Alara Kalama has faith, energy, mindfulness,
concentration, and wisdom. I too have faith, energy, mindfulness,
concentration, and wisdom. Suppose I endeavour to realise the Dhamma
that Alara Kalama declares he enters upon and abides in by realising
for himself with direct knowledge?'</P>
<P  >"I
soon quickly entered upon and abided in that Dhamma by realising for
myself with direct knowledge. Then I went to Alara Kalama and asked
him: 'Friend Kalama, is it in this way that you declare that you
enter upon and abide in this Dhamma by realising for yourself with
direct knowledge?' -'That is the way, friend.' - 'It is in
this way, friend, that I also enter upon and abide in this Dhamma by
realising for myself with direct knowledge.' - 'It is a gain for
us, friend, it is a great gain for us that we have such a venerable
one for our companion in the holy life. So the Dhamma that I declare
I enter upon and abide in by realising for myself with direct
knowledge is the Dhamma that you enter upon and abide in by realising
for yourself with direct knowledge. [165] And the Dhamma that you
enter upon and abide in by realising for yourself with direct
knowledge is the Dhamma that I declare I enter upon and abide in by
realising for myself with direct knowledge. So you know the Dhamma
that I know and I know the Dhamma that you know. As I am, so are you;
as you are, so am I. Come, friend, let us now lead this community
together.'</P>
<P  >"Thus
Alara Kalama, my teacher, placed me, his pupil, on an equal footing
with himself and awarded me the highest honour. But it occurred to
me: 'This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to
cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to
Nibbana, but only to reappearance in the base of nothingness.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote302anc" HREF="#sdendnote302sym"><SUP>cccii</SUP></A></SUP>
Not being satisfied with that Dhamma, I left it and went away.</P>
<P  >16.
"Still in search, bhikkhus, of what is wholesome, seeking the
supreme state of sublime peace, I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and said
to him: 'Friend, I want to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and
Discipline.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote303anc" HREF="#sdendnote303sym"><SUP>ccciii</SUP></A></SUP>
Uddaka Ramaputta replied: 'The venerable one may stay here. This
Dhamma is such that a wise man can soon enter upon and abide in it,

lip-reciting and rehearsal of his teaching went, I could speak with

there were others who did likewise.</P>
<P  >"I
considered: 'It was not through mere faith alone that Rama
declared: "By realising for myself with direct knowledge, I enter
upon and abide in this Dhamma." Certainly Rama abided knowing and
seeing this Dhamma.' Then I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and asked him:
'Friend, in what way did Rama declare that by realising for himself
with direct knowledge he entered upon and abided in this Dhamma?'
In reply Uddaka Ramaputta declared the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</P>
<P  >"I
considered: 'Not only Rama had faith, [166] energy, mindfulness,
concentration, and wisdom. I too have faith, energy, mindfulness,
concentration, and wisdom. Suppose I endeavour to realise the Dhamma
that Rama declared he entered upon and abided in by realising for
himself with direct knowledge.'</P>
<P  >"I
soon quickly entered upon and abided in that Dhamma by realising for
myself with direct knowledge. Then I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and
asked him: 'Friend, was it in this way that Rama declared that he
entered upon and abided in this Dhamma by realising for himself with
direct knowledge?' - 'That is the way, friend.' - 'It is in
this way, friend, that I also enter upon and abide in this Dhamma by
realising for myself with direct knowledge.' - 'It is a gain for
us, friend, it is a great gain for us that we have such a venerable
one for our companion</P>
<P  >in
the holy life. So the Dhamma that Rama declared he entered upon and

knew the Dhamma that you know. As Rama was, so are you; as you are,
so was Rama. Come, friend, now lead this community.'</P>
<P  >"Thus
Uddaka Ramaputta, my companion in the holy life, placed me in the
position of a teacher and accorded me the highest honour. But it
occurred to me: 'This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana, but only to reappearance in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.' Not being satisfied with
that Dhamma, I left it and went away.</P>
<P  >17.
"Still in search, bhikkhus, of what is wholesome, seeking the
supreme state of sublime peace, I wandered by stages through the
Magadhan country until eventually I arrived at Senanigama near
Uruvela. [167] There I saw an agreeable piece of ground, a delightful
grove with a clear-flowing river with pleasant, smooth banks and
nearby a village for alms resort. I considered: 'This is an
agreeable piece of ground, this is a delightful grove with a
clear-flowing river with pleasant, smooth banks and nearby a village
for alms resort. This will serve for the striving of a clansman
intent on striving.' And I sat down there thinking: 'This will
serve for striving.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote304anc" HREF="#sdendnote304sym"><SUP>ccciv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(ENLIGHTENMENT)</H3>
<P  >18.
"Then, bhikkhus, being myself subject to birth, having understood
the danger in what is subject to birth, seeking the unborn supreme
security from bondage, Nibbana, I attained the unborn supreme
security from bondage, Nibbana; being myself subject to ageing,
having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing, seeking
the unageing supreme security from bondage, Nibbana, I attained the
unageing supreme security from bondage, Nibbana; being myself subject
to sickness, having understood the danger in what is subject to
sickness, seeking the</P>
<P  >unailing
supreme security from bondage, Nibbana, I attained the unailing
supreme security from bondage, Nibbana; being myself subject to
death, having understood the danger in what is subject to death,
seeking the deathless supreme security from bondage, Nibbana, I
attained the deathless supreme security from bondage, Nibbana; being
myself subject to sorrow, having understood the danger in what is
subject to sorrow, seeking the sorrowless supreme security from
bondage, Nibbana, I attained the sorrowless supreme security from
bondage, Nibbana; being myself subject to defilement, having
understood the danger in what is subject to defilement, seeking the
undefiled supreme security from bondage, Nibbana, I attained the
undefiled supreme security from bondage, Nibbana. The knowledge and
vision arose in me: 'My deliverance is unshakeable; this is my last
birth; now there is no renewal of being.'</P>
<P  >19.
"I considered: 'This Dhamma that I have attained is profound,
hard to see and hard to understand, peaceful and sublime,
unattainable by mere reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by the
wise.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote305anc" HREF="#sdendnote305sym"><SUP>cccv</SUP></A></SUP>
But this generation delights in worldliness, takes delight in
worldliness, rejoices in worldliness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote306anc" HREF="#sdendnote306sym"><SUP>cccvi</SUP></A></SUP>
It is hard for such a generation to see this truth, namely, specific
conditionality, dependent origination. And it is hard to see this
truth, namely, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of
all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation,
Nibbana. [168] If I were to teach the Dhamma, others would not
understand me, and that would be wearying and troublesome for me.'
Thereupon there came to me spontaneously these stanzas never heard
before:</P>
<P >
'Enough with teaching the Dhamma</P>
<P >
That even I found hard to reach;</P>
<P >
For it will never be perceived</P>
<P >
By those who live in lust and hate.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Those dyed in lust, wrapped in darkness</P>
<P >
Will never discern this abstruse Dhamma</P>
<P >
Which goes against the worldly stream,</P>
<P >
Subtle, deep, and difficult to see.'</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >Considering
thus, my mind inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the
Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote307anc" HREF="#sdendnote307sym"><SUP>cccvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >20.
"Then, bhikkhus, the Brahma Sahampati knew with his mind the
thought in my mind and he considered: 'The world will be lost, the
world will perish, since the mind of the Tathagata, accomplished and
fully enlightened, inclines to inaction rather than to teaching the
Dhamma.' Then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his
flexed arm or flex his extended arm, the Brahma Sahampati vanished in
the Brahma-world and appeared before me. He arranged his upper robe
on one shoulder, and extending his hands in reverential salutation
towards me, said: 'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One teach the
Dhamma, let the Sublime One teach the Dhamma. There are beings with
little dust in their eyes who are wasting through not hearing the
Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma.' The
Brahma Sahampati spoke thus, and then he said further:</P>
<P >
'In Magadha there have appeared till now</P>
<P >
Impure teachings devised by those still stained.</P>
<P >
Open the doors to the Deathless!</P>
<P >
Let them hear The Dhamma that the Stainless One has found.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Just as one who stands on a mountain peak</P>
<P >
Can see below the people all around,</P>
<P >
So, O Wise One, All-seeing Sage,</P>
<P >
Ascend the palace of the Dhamma.</P>
<P >
Let the Sorrowless One survey this human breed,</P>
<P >
Engulfed in sorrow, overcome by birth and old age. [169]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Arise, victorious hero, caravan leader,</P>
<P >
Debtless one, and wander in the world.</P>
<P >
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma,</P>
<P >
There will be those who will understand.'</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >21.
"Then I listened to the Brahma's pleading, and out of compassion
for beings I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha. Surveying
the world with the eye of a Buddha, I saw beings with little dust in
their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with keen faculties and
with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy
to teach and hard to teach, and some who dwelt seeing fear in blame
and in the other world. Just as in a pond of blue or red or white
lotuses, some lotuses</P>
<P  >that
are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without
rising out of it, and some other lotuses that are born and grow in
the water rest on the water's surface, and some other lotuses that
are born and grow in the water rise out of the water and stand clear,
unwetted by it; so too, surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha,
I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in
their eyes, with keen faculties and with dull faculties, with good
qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach,
and some who dwelt seeing fear in blame and in the other world. Then
I replied to the Brahma Sahampati in stanzas:</P>
<P >
'Open for them are the doors to the Deathless,</P>
<P >
Let those with ears now show their faith.</P>
<P >
Thinking it would be troublesome,</P>
<P >
O Brahma, I did not speak the Dhamma subtle and sublime.'</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >Then
the Brahma Sahampati thought: 'I have created the opportunity for
the Blessed One to teach the Dhamma.' And after paying homage to
me, keeping me on the right, he thereupon departed at once.</P>
<P  >22.
"I considered thus: 'To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who
will understand this Dhamma quickly?' It then occurred to me:
'Alara Kalama is wise, intelligent, and discerning; he has long had
little dust in his eyes. Suppose I [170] taught the Dhamma first to
Alara Kalama. He will understand it quickly.' Then deities
approached me and said: 'Venerable sir, Alara Kalama died seven
days ago.' And the knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Alara
Kalama died seven days ago.' I thought: 'Alara Kalama's loss is
a great one. If he had heard this Dhamma, he would have understood it
quickly.'</P>
<P  >23.
"I considered thus: 'To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who
will understand this Dhamma quickly?' It then occurred to me:
'Uddaka Ramaputta is wise, intelligent, and discerning; he has long
had little dust in his eyes. Suppose I taught the Dhamma first to
Uddaka Ramaputta. He will understand it quickly.' Then deities
approached me and said: 'Venerable sir, Uddaka Ramaputta died last
night.' And the knowledge and vision arose in me: 'Uddaka
Ramaputta died last night.' I thought: 'Uddaka Ramaputta's loss
is a great one. If he had heard this Dhamma, he would have understood
it quickly.'</P>
<P  >24.
"I considered thus: 'To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who
will understand this Dhamma quickly?' It then occurred to me: 'The
bhikkhus of the group of five who attended upon me while I was
engaged in my striving were very helpful.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote308anc" HREF="#sdendnote308sym"><SUP>cccviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Suppose I taught the Dhamma first to them.' Then I thought: 'Where
are the bhikkhus of the group of five now living?' And with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw that
they were living at Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana.</P>
<H3 >(THE TEACHING OF THE DHAMMA)</H3>
<P  >25.
"Then, bhikkhus, when I had stayed at Uruvela as long as I chose, I
set out to wander by stages to Benares. Between Gaya and the Place of
Enlightenment the Ajivaka Upaka saw me on the road and said: 'Friend,
your faculties are clear, the colour of your skin is pure and bright.
Under whom have you gone forth, friend? Who is your teacher? Whose
Dhamma do you [171] profess?' I replied to the Ajivaka Upaka in
stanzas:</P>
<P >
'I am one who has transcended all, a knower of all,</P>
<P >
Unsullied among all things, renouncing all,</P>
<P >
By craving's ceasing freed. Having known this all</P>
<P >
For myself, to whom should I point as teacher?</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
I have no teacher, and one like me</P>
<P >
Exists nowhere in all the world</P>
<P >
With all its gods, because I have</P>
<P >
No person for my counterpart.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
I am the Accomplished One in the world,</P>
<P >
I am the Teacher Supreme.</P>
<P >
I alone am a Fully Enlightened One</P>
<P >
Whose fires are quenched and extinguished.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
I go now to the city of Kasi</P>
<P >
To set in motion the Wheel of Dhamma.</P>
<P >
In a world that has become blind</P>
<P >
I go to beat the drum of the Deathless.'</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
'By your claims, friend, you ought to be the Universal Victor.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote309anc" HREF="#sdendnote309sym"><SUP>cccix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
'The victors are those like me</P>
<P >
Who have won to destruction of taints.</P>
<P >
I have vanquished all evil states,</P>
<P >
Therefore, Upaka, I am a victor.'</P>
<P  >"When
this was said, the Ajivaka Upaka said: 'May it be so, friend.'
Shaking his head, he took a bypath and departed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote310anc" HREF="#sdendnote310sym"><SUP>cccx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >26.
"Then, bhikkhus, wandering by stages, I eventually came to Benares,
to the Deer Park at Isipatana, and I approached the bhikkhus of the
group of five. The bhikkhus saw me coming in the distance, and they
agreed among themselves thus: 'Friends, here comes the recluse
Gotama who lives luxuriously, who gave up his striving, and reverted
to luxury. We should not pay homage to him or rise up for him or
receive his bowl and outer robe. But a seat may be prepared for him.
If he likes, he may sit down.' However, as I approached, those
bhikkhus found themselves unable to keep their pact. One came to meet
me and took my bowl and outer robe, another prepared a seat, and
another set out water for my feet; however, they addressed me by name
and as 'friend.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote311anc" HREF="#sdendnote311sym"><SUP>cccxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >27.
"Thereupon I told them: 'Bhikkhus, do not address the Tathagata
by name and as "friend." The Tathagata is an Accomplished One,
[172] a Fully Enlightened One. Listen, bhikkhus, the Deathless has
been attained. I shall instruct you, I shall teach you the Dhamma.
Practising as you are instructed, by realising for yourselves here
and now through direct knowledge you will soon enter upon and abide
in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen
rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness.'</P>
<P  >"When
this was said, the bhikkhus of the group of five answered me thus:
'Friend Gotama, by the conduct, the practice, and the performance
of austerities that you undertook, you did not achieve any superhuman
states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble
ones.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote312anc" HREF="#sdendnote312sym"><SUP>cccxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Since you now live luxuriously, having given up your striving and
reverted to luxury, how will you have achieved any superhuman states,
any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones?'
When this was said, I told them: 'The Tathagata does not live
luxuriously, nor has he given up his striving and reverted to luxury.
The Tathagata is an Accomplished One, a Fully Enlightened One.
Listen, bhikkhus, the Deathless has been attained … from the home
life into homelessness.'</P>
<P  >"A
second time the bhikkhus of the group of five said to me: 'Friend
Gotama … how will you have achieved any super human states, any
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones?' A
second time I told them: 'The Tathagata does not live luxuriously …
from the home life into homelessness.' A third time the bhikkhus of
the group of five said to me: 'Friend Gotama … how will you have
achieved any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and
vision worthy of the noble ones?'</P>
<P  >28.
"When this was said I asked them: 'Bhikkhus, have you ever known
me to speak like this before?' - 'No, venerable sir.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote313anc" HREF="#sdendnote313sym"><SUP>cccxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
- 'Bhikkhus, the Tathagata is an Accomplished One, a Fully
Enlightened One. Listen, bhikkhus, the Deathless has been attained. I
shall instruct you, I shall teach you the Dhamma. Practising as you
are instructed, by realising for yourselves here and now through
direct knowledge you will soon enter upon and abide in that supreme
goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth
from the home life into homelessness.' [173]</P>

"I was able to convince the bhikkhus of the group of five.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote314anc" HREF="#sdendnote314sym"><SUP>cccxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Then I sometimes instructed two bhikkhus while the other three went
for alms, and the six of us lived on what those three bhikkhus
brought back from their almsround. Sometimes I instructed three

"Then the bhikkhus of the group of five, thus taught and instructed
by me, being themselves subject to birth, having understood the
danger in what is subject to birth, seeking the unborn supreme
security from bondage, Nibbana, attained the unborn supreme security
from bondage, Nibbana; being themselves subject to ageing, sickness,
death, sorrow, and defilement, having understood the danger in what
is subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement,
seeking the unageing, unailing, deathless, sorrowless, and undefiled
supreme security from bondage, Nibbana, they attained the unageing,
unailing, deathless, sorrowless, and undefiled supreme security from
bondage, Nibbana. The knowledge and vision arose in them: 'Our
deliverance is unshakeable; this is our last birth; there is no
renewal of being.'</P>
<H3 >(SENSUAL PLEASURE)</H3>
<P  >31.
"Bhikkhus, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote315anc" HREF="#sdendnote315sym"><SUP>cccxv</SUP></A></SUP>
What are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >32.
"As to those recluses and brahmins who are tied to these five cords
of sensual pleasure, infatuated with them and utterly committed to
them, and who use them without seeing the danger in them or
understanding the escape from them, it may be understood of them:
'They have met with calamity, met with disaster, the Evil One may
do with them as he likes.' Suppose a forest deer who was bound lay
down on a heap of snares; it might be understood of him: 'He has
met with calamity, met with disaster, the hunter can do with him as
he likes, and when the hunter comes he cannot go where he wants.'
So too, as to those recluses and brahmins who are tied to these five
cords of sensual pleasure … it may be understood of them: 'They
have met with calamity, met with disaster, the Evil One may do with
them as he likes.'</P>

"Suppose a forest deer is wandering in the forest wilds: he walks
without fear, stands without fear, sits without fear, lies down
without fear. Why is that? Because he is out of the hunter's range.
So too, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. This bhikkhu is said to have
blindfolded Mara, to have become invisible to the Evil One by
depriving Mara's eye of its opportunity.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote317anc" HREF="#sdendnote317sym"><SUP>cccxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

"Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has
self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. This
bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara …</P>
<P  >36.
"Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu abides
in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure
with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on
account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abiding
who has equanimity and is mindful.' This bhikkhu is said to have
blindfolded Mara …</P>

"Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana, which has neitherpain-nor-pleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. This bhikkhu is said to have
blindfolded Mara …</P>

"Again, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with
the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is
infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite
space. This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara …</P>

"Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware
that 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and

"Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the base of nothingness. This bhikkhu is said to

He walks without fear, stands without fear, sits without fear, lies

is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
