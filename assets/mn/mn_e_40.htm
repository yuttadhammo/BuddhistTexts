40. Cula-Assapura Sutta - The Shorter Discourse at Assapura</H2>
<P  >[281]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Angan country at a town of the Angans named Assapura. There the
Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable
sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“‘Recluses, recluses,’ bhikkhus, that is how people perceive
you. And when you are asked, ‘What are you?’ you claim that you
are recluses. Since that is what you are designated and what you
claim to be, you should train thus: ‘We will practise the way
proper to the recluse<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote422anc" HREF="#sdendnote422sym"><SUP>cdxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
so that our designations may be true and our claims genuine, and so
that the services of those whose robes, almsfood, resting place, and
medicinal requisites we use shall bring them great fruit and benefit,
and so that our going forth shall not be in vain but fruitful and
fertile.’</P>
<P  >3.
“How, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu not practise the way proper to the
recluse? For so long as a bhikkhu who is covetous has not abandoned
covetousness, who has a mind of ill will has not abandoned ill will,
who is angry has not abandoned anger, who is revengeful has not
abandoned revenge, who is contemptuous has not abandoned contempt,
who is domineering has not abandoned his domineering attitude, who is
envious has not abandoned envy, who is avaricious has not abandoned
avarice, who is fraudulent has not abandoned fraud, who is deceitful
has not abandoned deceit, who has evil wishes has not abandoned evil
wishes, who has wrong view has not abandoned wrong view,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote423anc" HREF="#sdendnote423sym"><SUP>cdxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
for so long he does not practise the way proper to the recluse, I
say, because of his failure to abandon these stains for the recluse,
these faults for the recluse, these dregs for the recluse, which are
grounds for rebirth in a state of deprivation and whose results are
to be experienced in an unhappy destination.</P>
<P  >4.
“Suppose the weapon called a mataja, well whetted on both edges,
were enclosed and encased in a patchwork sheath. I say that such a
bhikkhu’s going forth is comparable to that.</P>
<P  >5.
“I do not say that the recluse’s status comes about in a
patchwork-cloak wearer through the mere wearing of the patchwork
cloak, nor in a naked ascetic through mere nakedness, nor in a
dweller in dust and dirt through mere dust and dirt, nor in a washer
in water through mere washing in water, nor in a treeroot dweller
through mere [282] dwelling at the root of a tree, nor in an open-air
dweller through mere dwelling in the open air, nor in a practitioner
of continuous standing through mere continuous standing, nor in a
taker of food at stated intervals through mere taking of food at
stated intervals, nor in a reciter of incantations through mere
recitation of incantations; nor do I say that the recluse’s status
comes about in a matted-hair ascetic through mere wearing of the hair
matted.</P>
<P  >6.
“Bhikkhus, if through the mere wearing of the patchwork cloak a
patchwork-cloak wearer who was covetous abandoned covetousness, who
had a mind of ill will abandoned ill will … who had wrong view
abandoned wrong view, then his friends and companions, his kinsmen
and relatives, would make him a patchwork-cloak wearer as soon as he
was born and have him undertake the patchwork-cloak wearing thus:
‘Come, my dear, be a patchwork-cloak wearer so that, as a
patchwork-cloak wearer, when you are covetous you will abandon
covetousness, when you have a mind of ill will you will abandon ill
will … when you have wrong view you will abandon wrong view.’ But
I see here a patchwork-cloak wearer who is covetous, who has a mind
of ill will … who has wrong view; and that is why I do not say that
the recluse’s status comes about in a patchwork-cloak wearer
through the mere wearing of the patchwork cloak.</P>
<P  >“If
through mere nakedness a naked ascetic who was covetous abandoned
covetousness … If through mere dust and dirt … if through mere
washing in water … If through mere dwelling at the root of a tree …
If through mere dwelling in the open air … If through mere
continuous standing … If through mere taking of food at stated
intervals … If through mere recitation of incantations … If
through mere wearing of the hair matted … [283] … and that is why
I do not say that the recluse’s status comes about in a matted-hair
ascetic through the mere wearing of the hair matted.</P>
<P  >7.
“How, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu practise the way proper to the
recluse? When any bhikkhu who was covetous has abandoned
covetousness, who had a mind of ill will has abandoned ill will, who
was angry has abandoned anger, who was revengeful has abandoned
revenge, who was contemptuous has abandoned contempt, who was
domineering has abandoned his domineering attitude, who was envious
has abandoned envy, who was avaricious has abandoned avarice, who was
fraudulent has abandoned fraud, who was deceitful has abandoned
deceit, who had evil wishes has abandoned evil wishes, who had wrong
view has abandoned wrong view, then he practises the way proper to
the recluse, I say, because of his abandoning these stains for the
recluse, these faults for the recluse, these dregs for the recluse,
which are grounds for rebirth in a state of deprivation and whose
results are to be experienced in an unhappy destination.</P>
<P  >8.
“He sees himself purified of all these evil unwholesome states, he
sees himself liberated from them. When he sees this, gladness is born
in him. When he is glad, rapture is born in him; in one who is
rapturous, the body becomes tranquil; one whose body is tranquil
feels pleasure; in one who feels pleasure, the mind becomes
concentrated.</P>
<P  >9.
“He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise
the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to
himself, he abides pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind
imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility and without ill will.</P>
<P  >10-12.
“He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion
… with a mind imbued with appreciative joy … with a mind imbued
with equanimity … abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility and without ill will.</P>
<P  >13.
“Suppose there were a pond with clear, agreeable cool water,
transparent, with smooth banks, delightful. [284] If a man, scorched
and exhausted by hot weather, weary, parched, and thirsty, came from
the east or from the west or from the north or from the south or from
where you will, having come upon the pond he would quench his thirst
and his hot-weather fever. So too, bhikkhus, if anyone from a clan of
nobles goes forth from the home life into homelessness, and after
encountering the</P>
<P  >Dhamma
and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata, develops loving-kindness,
compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity, and thereby gains
internal peace, then because of that internal peace he practises the
way proper to the recluse, I say. And if anyone from a clan of
brahmins goes forth … If anyone from a clan of merchants goes forth
… If anyone from a clan of workers goes forth from the home life
into homelessness, and after encountering the Dhamma and Discipline
proclaimed by the Tathagata, develops loving-kindness, compassion,
appreciative joy, and equanimity, and thereby gains internal peace,
then because of that internal peace he practises the way proper to
the recluse, I say.</P>
<P  >14.
“Bhikkhus, if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth from the home
life into homelessness, and by realising for himself with direct
knowledge here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of
mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the
destruction of the taints, then he is already a recluse because of
the destruction of the taints.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote424anc" HREF="#sdendnote424sym"><SUP>cdxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
And if anyone from a clan of brahmins goes forth … If anyone from a
clan of merchants goes forth … If anyone from a clan of workers
goes forth from the home life into homelessness, and by realising for
himself with direct knowledge here and now enters upon and abides in
the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless
with the destruction of the taints, then he is already a recluse
because of the destruction of the taints.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
