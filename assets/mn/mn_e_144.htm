144. Channovada Sutta - Advice to Channa</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta, the venerable Maha
Cunda, and the venerable Channa were living on the mountain Vulture
Peak.</P>
<P  >3.
On that occasion the venerable Channa was afflicted, suffering, and
gravely ill. Then, when it was evening, the venerable Sariputta rose
from meditation, went to the venerable Maha Cunda, and said to him:
“Friend Cunda, let us go to the venerable Channa and ask about his
illness.” - “Yes, friend,” the venerable Maha Cunda replied.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the venerable Sariputta and the venerable Maha Cunda went to the
venerable Channa and exchanged greetings with him. When [264] this
courteous and amiable talk was finished, they sat down at one side
and the venerable Sariputta said to the venerable Channa: “I hope
you are getting well, friend Channa, I hope you are comfortable. I
hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that
their subsiding, not their increase, is apparent.”</P>
<P  >5.
“Friend Sariputta, I am not getting well, I am not comfortable. My
painful feelings are increasing, not subsiding; … (as Sutta 143,
§4) … their increase and not their subsiding is apparent. I shall.

friend Sariputta; I have no desire to live.”</P>
<P  >6.
“Let the venerable Channa not use the knife. Let the venerable
Channa live. We want the venerable Channa to live. If he lacks
suitable food, I will go in search of suitable food for him. If he
lacks suitable medicine, I will go in search of suitable medicine for
him. If he lacks a proper attendant, I will attend on him. Let the
venerable Channa not use the knife. Let the venerable Channa live. We
want the venerable Channa to live.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Friend Sariputta, it is not that I have no suitable food and
medicine or no proper attendant. But rather, friend Sariputta, the
Teacher has long been worshipped by me with love, not without love;
for it is proper for the disciple to worship the Teacher with love,
not without love. Friend Sariputta, remember this: the bhikkhu Channa
will use the knife blamelessly.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1308anc" HREF="#sdendnote1308sym"><SUP>mcccviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
“We would ask the venerable Channa certain questions, if the
venerable Channa finds it opportune to reply.”</P>
<P  >“Ask,
friend Sariputta. When I have heard, I shall know.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Friend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye-consciousness, and
things cognizable [by the mind] through eye-consciousness thus: ‘This
is mine, this I am, [265] this is my self’? Do you regard the ear …
the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind,
mind-consciousness, and things cognizable [by the mind] through
mind-consciousness thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my
self’?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Sariputta, I regard the eye, eye-consciousness, and things cognizable
[by the mind] through eye-consciousness thus: ‘This is not mine,
this I am not, this is not my self.’ I regard the ear … the nose
… the tongue … the body … the mind, mind-consciousness, and
things cognizable [by the mind] through mind-consciousness thus:
‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’“</P>
<P  >10.
“Friend Channa, what have you seen, what have you directly known in
the eye, in eye-consciousness, and in things cognizable [by the mind]
through eye-consciousness, that you regard them thus: ‘This is not
mine, this I am not, this is not my self’? What have you seen, what
have you directly known in the ear … in the nose … in the tongue
… in the body … in the mind, in mind-consciousness, and in things
cognizable [by the mind] through mind-consciousness, that you regard
them thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self’?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Sariputta, it is through seeing cessation, through directly knowing
cessation in the eye, in eye-consciousness, and in things cognizable
[by the mind] through eye-consciousness, that I regard them thus:
‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ It is
through seeing cessation, through directly knowing cessation in the
ear … in the nose … in the tongue … in the body … in the
mind, in mind-consciousness, and in things cognizable [by the mind]
through mind-consciousness, [266] that I regard them thus: ‘This is
not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’“</P>
<P  >11.
When this was said, the venerable Maha Cunda said to the venerable
Channa:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1309anc" HREF="#sdendnote1309sym"><SUP>mcccix</SUP></A></SUP>
“Therefore, friend Channa, this instruction of the Blessed One’s
is to be constantly given attention: ‘There is wavering in one who
is dependent, there is no wavering in one who is independent; when
there is no wavering, there is tranquillity; when there is
tranquillity, there is no bias; when there is no bias, there is no
coming and going; when there is no coming and going, there is no
passing away and reappearing; when there is no passing away and
reappearing, there is no here nor beyond nor in between. This is the
end of suffering.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1310anc" HREF="#sdendnote1310sym"><SUP>mcccx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
Then when the venerable Sariputta and the venerable Maha Cunda had
advised the venerable Channa thus, they rose from their seats and
went away. Then, soon after they had gone, the venerable Channa used
the knife.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1311anc" HREF="#sdendnote1311sym"><SUP>mcccxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
Then the venerable Sariputta went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed
One: “Venerable sir, the venerable Channa has used the knife. What
is his destination, what is his future course?”</P>
<P  >“Sariputta,
didn’t the bhikkhu Channa declare to you his blamelessness?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1312anc" HREF="#sdendnote1312sym"><SUP>mcccxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, there is a Vajjian village called Pubbajira. There the venerable
Channa had families that were his friends, families that were his
intimates, families that were blameworthy.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1313anc" HREF="#sdendnote1313sym"><SUP>mcccxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“There
are those families that were friends of the bhikkhu Channa,
Sariputta, families that were his intimates, families that were
blameworthy; but I do not say that to this extent he was blameworthy.
Sariputta, when one lays down this body and clings to a new body,
then I say one is blameworthy. There was none of that in the bhikkhu
Channa; the bhikkhu Channa used the knife blamelessly.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1314anc" HREF="#sdendnote1314sym"><SUP>mcccxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Sariputta was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
