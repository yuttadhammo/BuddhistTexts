4. Bhayabherava Sutta - Fear and Dread</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the brahmin Janussoni<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote56anc" HREF="#sdendnote56sym"><SUP>lvi</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this
courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and
said: “Master Gotama, when clansmen have gone forth from the home
life into homelessness out of faith in Master Gotama, do they have
Master Gotama for their leader, their helper, and their guide? And do
these people follow the example of Master Gotama?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote57anc" HREF="#sdendnote57sym"><SUP>lvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“That
is so, brahmin, that is so. When clansmen have gone forth from the
home life into homelessness out of faith in me, they have me for
their leader, their helper, and their guide. And these people follow
my example.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Master Gotama, remote jungle-thicket resting places in the forest are
hard to endure, seclusion is hard to practise, and it is hard to
enjoy solitude. One would think the jungles must rob a bhikkhu of his
mind, if he has no concentration.” [17]</P>
<P  >“That
is so, brahmin, that is so. Remote jungle-thicket resting places in
the forest are hard to endure, seclusion is hard to practise, and it
is hard to enjoy solitude. One would think the jungles must rob a
bhikkhu of his mind, if he has no concentration.</P>
<P  >3.
“Before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened
Bodhisatta, I too considered thus: ‘Remote jungle-thicket resting
places in the forest are hard to endure … the jungles must rob a
bhikkhu of his mind, if he has no concentration.’</P>
<P  >4.
“I considered thus: ‘Whenever recluses or brahmins unpurified in
bodily conduct resort to remote jungle-thicket resting places in the
forest, then owing to the defect of their unpurified bodily conduct
these good recluses and brahmins evoke unwholesome fear and dread.
But I do not resort to remote jungle-thicket resting places in the
forest unpurified in bodily conduct. I am purified in bodily conduct.
I resort to remote junglethicket resting places in the forest as one
of the noble ones with bodily conduct purified.’ Seeing in myself
this purity of bodily conduct, I found great solace in dwelling in
the forest.</P>
<P  >5-7.
“I considered thus: ‘Whenever recluses or brahmins unpurified in
verbal conduct … unpurified in mental conduct … unpurified in
livelihood resort to remote jungle-thicket resting places in the
forest … they evoke unwholesome fear and dread. But … I am
purified in livelihood. I resort to remote jungle-thicket resting
places in the forest as one of the noble ones with livelihood
purified.’ Seeing in myself this purity of livelihood, I found
great solace in dwelling in the forest.</P>
<P  >8.
“I considered thus: ‘Whenever recluses or brahmins who are
covetous and full of lust … I am uncovetous … ’ [18]</P>
<P  >9.
“‘… with a mind of ill will and intentions of hate … I have a
mind of loving-kindness … ’</P>
<P  >10.
“‘… overcome by sloth and torpor … 1 am without sloth and
torpor … ’</P>
<P  >11.
“‘… overcome with restless and unpeaceful mind … I have a
peaceful mind … ’</P>
<P  >12.
“‘… uncertain and doubting … I have gone beyond doubt … ’</P>
<P  >13.
“‘[19] … given to self-praise and disparagement of others … I
am not given to self-praise and disparagement of others … ’</P>
<P  >14.
“‘… subject to alarm and terror … I am free from trepidation
… ’</P>
<P  >15.
“‘… desirous of gain, honour, and renown … I have few wishes
… ’</P>
<P  >16.
“‘… lazy and wanting in energy … I am energetic … ’</P>
<P  >17.
“‘… [20] unmindful and not fully aware … I am established in
mindfulness … ’</P>
<P  >18.
“‘… unconcentrated and with straying minds … I am possessed
of concentration … ’</P>
<P  >19.
“1 considered thus: ‘Whenever recluses or brahmins devoid of
wisdom, drivellers, resort to remote jungle-thicket resting places in
the forest, then owing to the defect of their being devoid of wisdom
and drivellers these good recluses and brahmins evoke unwholesome
fear and dread. But I do not resort to remote jungle-thicket resting
places in the forest devoid of wisdom, a driveller. I am possessed of
wisdom.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote58anc" HREF="#sdendnote58sym"><SUP>lviii</SUP></A></SUP>
I resort to remote jungle-thicket resting places in the forest as one
of the noble ones possessed of wisdom.’ Seeing in myself this
possession of wisdom, I found great solace in dwelling in the forest.</P>
<P  >20.
“I considered thus: ‘There are the specially auspicious nights of
the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth of the fortnight.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote59anc" HREF="#sdendnote59sym"><SUP>lix</SUP></A></SUP>
Now what if, on such nights as these, I were to dwell in such
awe-inspiring, horrifying abodes as orchard shrines, woodland
shrines, and tree shrines? Perhaps I might encounter that fear and
dread.’ And later, on such specially auspicious nights as the
fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth of the fortnight, I dwelt
in such awe-inspiring, horrifying abodes as orchard shrines, woodland
shrines, and tree shrines. And while I dwelt there, a wild animal
would come up to me, or a peacock [21] would knock off a branch, or
the wind would rustle the leaves. I thought: ‘What now if this is
the fear and dread coming?’ I thought: ‘Why do I dwell always
expecting fear and dread? What if I subdue that fear and dread while
keeping the same posture that I am in when it comes upon me?’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote60anc" HREF="#sdendnote60sym"><SUP>lx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“While
I walked, the fear and dread came upon me; I neither stood nor sat
nor lay down till I had subdued that fear and dread. While I stood,
the fear and dread came upon me; I neither walked nor sat nor lay
down till I had subdued that fear and dread. While I sat, the fear
and dread came upon me; I neither walked nor stood nor lay down till
I had subdued that fear and dread. While I lay down, the fear and
dread came upon me; I neither walked nor stood nor sat down till I
had subdued that fear and dread.</P>
<P  >21.
“There are, brahmin, some recluses and brahmins who perceive day
when it is night and night when it is day. I say that on their part
this is an abiding in delusion. But I perceive night when it is night
and day when it is day. Rightly speaking, were it to be said of
anyone: ‘A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world
for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion for the
world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans,’ it
is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be said.</P>
<P  >22.
“Tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was
established, my body was tranquil and untroubled, my mind
concentrated and unified.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote61anc" HREF="#sdendnote61sym"><SUP>lxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
“Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, I entered upon and abided in the first jhana, which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote62anc" HREF="#sdendnote62sym"><SUP>lxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >24.
“With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, I entered upon
and abided in the second jhana, which has selfconfidence and
singleness of mind [22] without applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of concentration.</P>
<P  >25.
“With the fading away as well of rapture, I abided in equanimity,
and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, I
entered upon and abided in the third jhana, on account of which noble
ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is
mindful.’</P>
<P  >26.
“With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous
disappearance of joy and grief, I entered upon and abided in the
fourth jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of
mindfulness due to equanimity.</P>
<P  >27.
“When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote63anc" HREF="#sdendnote63sym"><SUP>lxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
I recollected my manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births,
three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births,
thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a
thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of
world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of
world-contraction and expansion: ‘There I was so named, of such a
clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my
experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away
from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of
such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my
experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away
from there, I reappeared here.’ Thus with their aspects and
particulars I recollected my manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >28.
“This was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute.</P>
<P  >29.
“When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote64anc" HREF="#sdendnote64sym"><SUP>lxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw
beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and
ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. I understood how beings pass on
according to their actions thus: ‘These worthy beings who were
ill-conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones,
wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions,
on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a
state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in
hell; but these worthy beings who were well-conducted in body, [23]
speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views,
giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in
the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified
and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and reappearing,
inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and
I understood how beings pass on according to their actions.</P>
<P  >30.
“This was the second true knowledge attained by me in the second
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute.</P>
<P  >31.
“When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’;
I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is the origin of
suffering’; I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is the
cessation of suffering’; I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This
is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ I directly knew
as it actually is: ‘These are the taints’; I directly knew as it
actually is: ‘This is the origin of the taints’; I directly knew
as it actually is: ‘This is the cessation of the taints’; I
directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is the way leading to the
cessation of the taints.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote65anc" HREF="#sdendnote65sym"><SUP>lxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >32.
“When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of
sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it was liberated, there came the knowledge: ‘It is
liberated.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote66anc" HREF="#sdendnote66sym"><SUP>lxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
I directly knew: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived,
what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any
state of being.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote67anc" HREF="#sdendnote67sym"><SUP>lxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >33.
“This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the third
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute.</P>
<P  >34.
“Now, brahmin, it might be that you think: ‘Perhaps the recluse
Gotama is not free from lust, hate, and delusion even today, which is
why he still resorts to remote jungle-thicket resting places in the
forest.’ But you should not think thus. It is because I see two
benefits that I still resort to remote jungle-thicket resting places
in the forest: I see a pleasant abiding for myself here and now, and
I have compassion for future generations.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote68anc" HREF="#sdendnote68sym"><SUP>lxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >35.
“Indeed, it is because Master Gotama is an Accomplished One, a
Fully Enlightened One, that he has compassion for future generations.
[24] Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today
let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
for refuge for life.”</P>
