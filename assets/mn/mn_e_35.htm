35. Culasaccaka Sutta - The Shorter Discourse to Saccaka</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was staying at
Vesali, a debater and a clever speaker regarded by many as a saint.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote369anc" HREF="#sdendnote369sym"><SUP>ccclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
He was making this statement before the Vesali assembly: “I see no
recluse or brahmin, the head of an order, the head of a group, the
teacher of a group, even one claiming to be accomplished and fully
enlightened, who would not shake, shiver, and tremble, and sweat
under the armpits if he were to engage in debate with me. Even if I
were to engage a senseless post in debate, it would shake, shiver,
and tremble if it were to engage in debate with me, so what shall I
say of a human being?”</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Assaji dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, went into Vesali for alms.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote370anc" HREF="#sdendnote370sym"><SUP>ccclxx</SUP></A></SUP>
As Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was walking and wandering for
exercise in Vesali, [228] he saw the venerable Assaji coming in the
distance and went up to him and exchanged greetings with him. When
this courteous and amiable talk was finished, Saccaka the Nigantha’s
son stood at one side and said to him:</P>
<P  >4.
“Master Assaji, how does the recluse Gotama discipline his
disciples? And how is the recluse Gotama’s instruction usually
presented to his disciples?”</P>
<P  >“This
is how the Blessed One disciplines his disciples, Aggivessana, and
this is how the Blessed One’s instruction is usually presented to
his disciples: ‘Bhikkhus, material form is impermanent, feeling is
impermanent, perception is impermanent, formations are impermanent,
consciousness is impermanent. Bhikkhus, material form is not self,
feeling is not self, perception is not self, formations are not self,
consciousness is not self. All formations are impermanent; all things
are not self.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote371anc" HREF="#sdendnote371sym"><SUP>ccclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how the Blessed One disciplines his disciples, and that is
how the Blessed One’s instruction is usually presented to his
disciples.”</P>
<P  >“If
this is what the recluse Gotama asserts, we hear indeed what is
disagreeable. Perhaps sometime or other we might meet Master Gotama
and have some conversation with him. Perhaps we might detach him from
that evil view.”</P>
<P  >5.
Now at that time five hundred Licchavis had met together in an
assembly hall for some business or other. Then Saccaka the Nigantha’s
son went to them and said: “Come forth, good Licchavis, come forth!
Today there will be some conversation between me and the recluse
Gotama. If the recluse Gotama maintains before me what was maintained
before me by one of his famous disciples, the bhikkhu named Assaji,
then just as a strong man might seize a long-haired ram by the hair
and drag him to and drag him fro and drag him round about, so in
debate I will drag the recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag
him round about. Just as a strong brewer’s workman might throw a
big brewer’s sieve into a deep water tank, and taking it by the
corners, drag it to and drag it fro and drag it round about, so in
debate I will drag the recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag
him round about. Just as a strong brewer’s mixer [229] might take a
strainer by the corners and shake it down and shake it up and thump
it about, so in debate I will shake the recluse Gotama down and shake
him up and thump him about. And just as a sixty-year-old elephant
might plunge into a deep pond and enjoy playing the game of
hemp-washing, so I shall enjoy playing the game of hemp-washing with
the recluse Gotama.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote372anc" HREF="#sdendnote372sym"><SUP>ccclxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Come forth, good Licchavis, come forth! Today there will be some
conversation between me and the recluse Gotama.”</P>
<P  >6.
Thereupon some Licchavis said: “How can the recluse Gotama refute
Saccaka the Nigantha’s son’s assertions? On the contrary, Saccaka
the Nigantha’s son will refute the recluse Gotama’s assertions.”
And some Licchavis said: “Who is Saccaka the Nigantha’s son that
he could refute the Blessed One’s assertions? On the contrary, the
Blessed One will refute Saccaka the Nigantha’s son’s assertions.”
Then Saccaka the Nigantha’s son went with five hundred Licchavis to
the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great Wood.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in
the open. Then Saccaka the Nigantha’s son went up to them and
asked: “Where is Master Gotama staying now, sirs? We want to see
Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“The
Blessed One has entered the Great Wood, Aggivessana, and is sitting
at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding.”</P>
<P  >8.
Then Saccaka the Nigantha’s son, together with a large following of
Licchavis, entered the Great Wood and went to the Blessed One. He
exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and after this courteous
and amiable talk was finished, sat down at one side. Some of the
Licchavis paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side;
some exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their
hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down
at one side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One’s
presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at
one side.</P>
<P  >9.
When Saccaka the Nigantha’s son had sat down, he said to the
Blessed One: “I would like to question Master Gotama on a certain
point, if Master Gotama would grant me the favour of an answer to the
question.”</P>
<P  >“Ask
what you like, Aggivessana.” [230]</P>
<P  >“How
does Master Gotama discipline his disciples? And how is Master
Gotama’s instruction usually presented to his disciples?”</P>
<P  >“This
is how I discipline my disciples, Aggivessana, and this is how my
instruction is usually presented to my disciples: ‘Bhikkhus,
material form is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is
impermanent, formations are impermanent, consciousness is
impermanent. Bhikkhus, material form is not self, feeling is not
self, perception is not self, formations are not self, consciousness
is not self. All formations are impermanent; all things are not
self.’ That is the way I discipline my disciples, and that is how
my instruction is usually presented to my disciples.”</P>
<P  >10.
“A simile occurs to me, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“Explain
how it occurs to you, Aggivessana,” the Blessed One said.</P>
<P  >“Just
as when seeds and plants, whatever their kind, reach growth,
increase, and maturation, all do so in dependence upon the earth,
based upon the earth; and just as when strenuous works, whatever
their kind, are done, all are done in dependence upon the earth,
based upon the earth - so too, Master</P>
<P  >Gotama,
a person has material form as self, and based upon material form he
produces merit or demerit. A person has feeling as self, and based
upon feeling he produces merit or demerit. A person has perception as
self, and based upon perception he produces merit or demerit. A
person has formations as self, and based upon formations he produces
merit or demerit. A person has consciousness as self, and based upon
consciousness he produces merit or demerit.”</P>
<P  >11.
“Aggivessana, are you not asserting thus: ‘Material form is my
self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, formations are my
self, consciousness is my self’?”</P>
<P  >“I
assert thus, Master Gotama: ‘Material form is my self, feeling is
my self, perception is my self, formations are my self, con
sciousness is my self.’ And so does this great multitude.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote373anc" HREF="#sdendnote373sym"><SUP>ccclxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“What
has this great multitude to do with you, Aggivessana? Please confine
yourself to your own assertion alone.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
Master Gotama, I assert thus: ‘Material form is my self, feeling is
my self, perception is my self, formations are my self, consciousness
is my self.’“</P>
<P  >12.
“In that case, Aggivessana, I shall ask you a question in return.
Answer it as you choose. [231] What do you think, Aggivessana? Would
a head-anointed noble king - for example, King Pasenadi of Kosala or
King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha - exercise the power in his
own realm to execute those who should be executed, to fine those who
should be fined, and to banish those who should be banished?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Gotama, a head-anointed noble king - for example, King Pasenadi of
Kosala or King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha - would exercise the
power in his own realm to execute those who should be executed, to
fine those who should be fined, and to banish those who should be
banished. For even these [oligarchic] communities and societies such
as the Vajjians and the Mallians exercise the power in their own
realm to execute those who should be executed, to fine those who
should be fined, and to banish those who should be banished; so all
the more so should a head-anointed noble king such as King Pasenadi
of Kosala or King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha. He would
exercise it, Master Gotama, and he would be worthy to exercise it.”</P>
<P  >13.
“What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say thus: ‘Material
form is my self,’ do you exercise any such power over that material
form as to say: ‘Let my form be thus; let my form not be thus’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote374anc" HREF="#sdendnote374sym"><SUP>ccclxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
When this was said, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was silent.</P>
<P  >A
second time the Blessed One asked the same question, and a second
time Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was silent. Then the Blessed One
said to him: “Aggivessana, answer now. Now is not the time to be
silent. If anyone, when asked a reasonable question up to the third
time by the Tathagata, still does not answer, his head splits into
seven pieces there and then.”</P>
<P  >14.
Now on that occasion a thunderbolt-wielding spirit holding an iron
thunderbolt that burned, blazed, and glowed, appeared in the air
above Saccaka the Nigantha’s son, thinking: “If this Saccaka the
Nigantha’s son, when asked a reasonable question up to the third
time by the Blessed One, still does not answer, I shall split his
head into seven pieces here and now.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote375anc" HREF="#sdendnote375sym"><SUP>ccclxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
The Blessed One saw the thunderbolt-wielding spirit and so did
Saccaka the Nigantha’s son. Then Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was
frightened, alarmed, and terrified. [232] Seeking his shelter,
asylum, and refuge in the Blessed One, he said: “Ask me, Master
Gotama, I will answer.”</P>
<P  >15.
“What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say thus: ‘Material
form is my self,’ do you exercise any such power over that material
form as to say: ‘Let my form be thus; let my form not be thus’?”
- “No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >16.
“Pay attention, Aggivessana, pay attention how you reply! What you
said before does not agree with what you said afterwards, nor does
what you said afterwards agree with what you said before. What do you
think, Aggivessana? When you say thus: ‘Feeling is my self,’ do
you exercise any power over that feeling as to say: ‘Let my feeling
be thus; let my feeling not be thus’?” - “No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >17.
“Pay attention, Aggivessana, pay attention how you reply! What you
said before does not agree with what you said afterwards, nor does
what you said afterwards agree with what you said before. What do you
think, Aggivessana? When you say thus: ‘Perception is my self,’
do you exercise any power over that perception as to say: ‘Let my
perception be thus; let my perception not be thus’?” - “No,
Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >18.
“Pay attention, Aggivessana, pay attention how you reply! What you
said before does not agree with what you said afterwards, nor does
what you said afterwards agree with what you said before. What do you
think, Aggivessana? When you say thus: ‘Formations are my self,’
do you exercise any such power over those formations as to say: ‘Let
my formations be thus; let my formations not be thus’?” - “No,
Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >19.
“Pay attention, Aggivessana, pay attention how you reply! What you
said before does not agree with what you said afterwards, nor does
what you said afterwards agree with what you said before. What do you
think, Aggivessana? When you say thus: ‘Consciousness is my self,’
do you exercise any such power over that consciousness as to say:
‘Let my consciousness be thus; let my consciousness not be thus’?”
- “No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >20.
“Pay attention, Aggivessana, pay attention how you reply! What you
said before does not agree with what you said afterwards, nor does
what you said afterwards agree with what you said before. What do you
think, Aggivessana, is material form permanent or impermanent?” -
“Impermanent, Master Gotama.” - “Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?” - “Suffering, Master Gotama.” - “Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, [233] this is my self’?”
- “No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, Aggivessana? Is feeling permanent or impermanent? …
Is perception permanent or impermanent? … Are formations permanent
or impermanent? … Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?” -
“Impermanent, Master Gotama.” - “Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?” - “Suffering, Master Gotama.” - “Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?” -
“No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >21.
“What do you think, Aggivessana? When one adheres to suffering,
resorts to suffering, holds to suffering, and regards what is
suffering thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self,’ could
one ever fully understand suffering oneself or abide with suffering
utterly destroyed?”</P>
<P  >“How
could one, Master Gotama? No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >*”What
do you think, Aggivessana? That being so, do you not adhere to
suffering, resort to suffering, hold to suffering, and regard what is
suffering thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?”</P>
<P  >“How
could I not, Master Gotama? Yes, Master Gotama.”*<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote376anc" HREF="#sdendnote376sym"><SUP>ccclxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >22.
“It is as though a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood,
wandering in search of heartwood, were to take a sharp axe and enter
the wood, and there he would see a large plantain trunk, straight,
young, with no fruit-bud core. Then he would cut it down at the root,
cut off the crown, and unroll the leafsheaths; but as he went on
unrolling the leaf sheaths, he would never come even to any sapwood,
let alone heartwood. So too, Aggivessana, when you are pressed,
questioned, and cross questioned by me about your own assertion, you
turn out to be empty, vacant, and mistaken. But it was you who made
this statement before the Vesali assembly: ‘I see no recluse or
Brahmin, the head of an order, the head of a group, the teacher of a
group, even one claiming to be accomplished and fully enlightened,
who would not shake, shiver, and tremble and sweat under the armpits
if he were to engage in debate with me. Even if I were to engage a
senseless post in debate, it would shake, shiver, and tremble if it
were to engage in debate with me, so what shall I say of a human
being?’ Now there are drops of sweat on your forehead and they have
soaked through your upper robe and fallen to the ground. But there is
no sweat on my body now.” And the Blessed One uncovered his
goldencoloured body before the assembly. [234] When this was said,
Saccaka the Nigantha’s son sat silent, dismayed, with shoulders
drooping and head down, glum, and without response.</P>
<P  >23.
Then Dummukha, the son of the Licchavis, seeing Saccaka the
Nigantha’s son in such a condition, said to the Blessed One: “A
simile occurs to me, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“Explain
how it occurs to you, Dummukha.”</P>
<P  >“Suppose,
venerable sir, not far from a village or town there was a pond with a
crab in it. And then a party of boys and girls went out from the town
or village to the pond, went into the water, and pulled the crab out
of the water and put it on dry land. And whenever the crab extended a
leg, they cut it off, broke it, and smashed it with sticks and
stones, so that the crab with all its legs cut off, broken, and
smashed, would be unable to get back to the pond as before. So too,
all Saccaka the Nigantha’s son’s contortions, writhings, and
vacillations have been cut off, broken, and smashed by the Blessed
One, and now he cannot get near the Blessed One again for the purpose
of debate.”</P>
<P  >24.
When this was said, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son told him: “Wait,
Dummukha, wait! We are not speaking with you, here we are speaking
with Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >[Then
he said]: “Let that talk of ours be, Master Gotama. Like that of
ordinary recluses and brahmins, it was mere prattle, I think. But in
what way is a disciple of the recluse Gotama one who carries out his
instruction, who responds to his advice, who has crossed beyond
doubt, become free from perplexity, gained intrepidity, and become
independent of others in the Teacher’s Dispensation?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote377anc" HREF="#sdendnote377sym"><SUP>ccclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Here,
Aggivessana, any kind of material form whatever, whether past,
future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior
or superior, far or near - a disciple of mine sees all material form
as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this
I am not, this is not my self.’ [235] Any kind of feeling whatever
… Any kind of perception whatever … Any kind of formations
whatever … Any kind of consciousness whatever, whether past,
future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior
or superior, far or near - a disciple of mine sees all consciousness
as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this
I am not, this is not my self.’ It is in this way that a disciple
of mine is one who carries out my instruction, who responds to my
advice, who has crossed beyond doubt, become free from perplexity,
gained intrepidity, and become independent of others in the Teacher’s
Dispensation.”</P>
<P  >25.
“Master Gotama, in what way is a bhikkhu an arahant with taints
destroyed, one who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done,
laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of
being, and is completely liberated through final knowledge?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
Aggivessana, any kind of material form whatever, whether past,
future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior
or superior, far or near - a bhikkhu has seen all material form as it
actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am
not, this is not my self,’ and through not clinging he is
liberated. Any kind of feeling whatever … Any kind of perception
whatever … Any kind of formations whatever … Any kind of
consciousness whatever, whether past, future, or present, internal or
external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near - a
bhikkhu has seen all consciousness as it actually is with proper
wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my
self,’ and through not clinging he is liberated. It is in this way
that a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed, one who has lived
the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden,
reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is
completely liberated through final knowledge.</P>
<P  >26.
“When a bhikkhu’s mind is thus liberated, he possesses three
unsurpassable qualities: unsurpassable vision, unsurpassable practice
of the way, and unsurpassable deliverance.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote378anc" HREF="#sdendnote378sym"><SUP>ccclxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
When a bhikkhu is thus liberated, he still honours, reveres, and
venerates the Tathagata thus: ‘The Blessed One is enlightened and
he teaches the Dhamma for the sake of enlightenment. The Blessed One
is tamed and he teaches the Dhamma for taming oneself. The Blessed
One is at peace and he teaches the Dhamma for the sake of peace. The
Blessed One has crossed over and he teaches the Dhamma for crossing
over. The Blessed One has attained Nibbana and he teaches the Dhamma
for attaining Nibbana.’“</P>
<P  >27.
When this was said, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son [236] replied:
“Master Gotama, we were bold and impudent in thinking we could
attack Master Gotama in debate. A man might attack a mad elephant and
find safety, yet he could not attack Master Gotama and find safety. A
man might attack a blazing mass of fire and find safety, yet he could
not attack Master Gotama and find safety. A man might attack a
terrible poisonous snake and find safety, yet he could not attack
Master Gotama and find safety. We were bold and impudent in thinking
we could attack Master Gotama in debate.</P>
<P  >“Let
the Blessed One together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to
accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Blessed One consented in
silence.</P>
<P  >28.
Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, Saccaka the
Nigantha’s son addressed the Licchavis: “Hear me, Licchavis. The
recluse Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus has been invited
by me for tomorrow’s meal. You may bring to me whatever you think
would be suitable for him.”</P>
<P  >29.
Then, when the night had ended, the Licchavis brought five hundred
ceremonial dishes of milk rice as gifts of food. Then Saccaka the
Nigantha’s son had good food of various kinds prepared in his own
park and had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It is time,
Master Gotama, the meal is ready.”</P>
<P  >30.
Then, it being morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl
and outer robe, he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the park of
Saccaka the Nigantha’s son and sat down on the seat made ready.
Then, with his own hands, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son served and
satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the
various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One had eaten and had
withdrawn his hand from the bowl, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son took a
low seat, sat down at one side, and said to the Blessed One: “Master
Gotama, may the merit and the great meritorious fruits of this act of
giving be for the happiness of the givers.”</P>
<P  >“Aggivessana,
whatever comes about from giving to a recipient such as yourself -
one who is not free from lust, not free from hate, not free from
delusion - [237] that will be for the givers. And whatever comes
about from giving to a recipient such as myself - one who is free
from lust, free from hate, free from delusion - that will be for
you.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote379anc" HREF="#sdendnote379sym"><SUP>ccclxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
