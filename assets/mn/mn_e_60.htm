60. Apannaka Sutta - The Incontrovertible Teaching</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually
he arrived at a Kosalan brahmin village named Sala.</P>
<P  >2.
The brahmin householders of Sala heard: "The recluse Gotama, the
son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been
wandering in the Kosalan country [401] with a large Sangha of
bhikkhus and has come to Sala. Now a good report of Master Gotama has
been spread to this effect: 'That Blessed One is accomplished,
fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime,
knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher
of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with
its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this generation with its
recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, which he has
himself realised with direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma good in
the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the
right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is
utterly perfect and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants."</P>
<P  >3.
Then the brahmin householders of Sala went to the Blessed One. Some
paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their hands in
reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one
side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's
presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at
one side.</P>
<P  >4.
When they were seated, the Blessed One asked them: "Householders,
is there any teacher agreeable to you in whom you have acquired faith
supported by reasons?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote619anc" HREF="#sdendnote619sym"><SUP>dcxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir, there is no teacher agreeable to us in whom we have
acquired faith supported by reasons."</P>
<P  >"Since,
householders, you have not found an agreeable teacher, you may
undertake and practise this incontrovertible teaching;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote620anc" HREF="#sdendnote620sym"><SUP>dcxx</SUP></A></SUP>
for when the incontrovertible teaching is accepted and undertaken, it
will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. And what is
the incontrovertible teaching ?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote621anc" HREF="#sdendnote621sym"><SUP>dcxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(I. THE DOCTRINE OF NIHILISM)</H3>
<P  >5.
(A) "Householders, there are some recluses and brahmins whose
doctrine and view is this: 'There is nothing given, nothing
offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and bad
actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no
beings who are reborn spontaneously; no good and virtuous recluses
and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct
knowledge and declare this world and the other world.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote622anc" HREF="#sdendnote622sym"><SUP>dcxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
[402]</P>
<P  >6.
(B) "Now there are some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine is
directly opposed to that of those recluses and brahmins, and they say
thus: 'There is what is given and what is offered and what is
sacrificed; there is fruit and result of good and bad actions; there
is this world and the other world; there is mother and father; there
are beings who are reborn spontaneously; there are good and virtuous
recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by
direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.' What
do you think, householders? Don't these recluses and brahmins hold
doctrines directly opposed to each other?" - "Yes, venerable
sir."</P>
<P  >7.
(A.i) "Now, householders, of those recluses and brahmins whose
doctrine and view is this: 'There is nothing given … no good and
virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves
realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other
world,' it is to be expected that they will avoid these three
wholesome states, namely, good bodily conduct, good verbal conduct,
and good mental conduct, and that they will undertake and practise
these three unwholesome states, namely, bodily misconduct, verbal
misconduct, and mental misconduct. Why is that? Because those good
recluses and brahmins do not see in unwholesome states the danger,
degradation, and defilement, nor do they see in wholesome states the
blessing of renunciation, the aspect of cleansing.</P>
<P  >8.
(A.ii) "Since there actually is another world, one who holds the
view 'there is no other world' has wrong view. Since there
actually is another world, one who intends 'there is no other
world' has wrong intention. Since there actually is another world,
one who makes the statement 'there is no other world' has wrong
speech. Since there actually is another world, one who says 'there
is no other world' is opposed to those arahants who know the other
world. Since there actually is another world, one who convinces
another 'there is no other world' convinces him to accept an
untrue Dhamma; and because he convinces another to accept an untrue
Dhamma, he praises himself and disparages others. Thus any pure
virtue that he formerly had is abandoned and corrupt conduct is
substituted.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote623anc" HREF="#sdendnote623sym"><SUP>dcxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
And this wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, opposition to
noble ones, convincing another to accept an untrue Dhamma, and
self-praise and disparagement of others - these several evil
unwholesome states thus come into being with wrong view as their
condition. [403]</P>

will have made himself safe enough.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote624anc" HREF="#sdendnote624sym"><SUP>dcxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
But if there is another world, then on the dissolution of the body,
after death, he will reappear in a state of deprivation, in an
unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. Now whether or not
the word of those good recluses and brahmins is true, let me assume
that there is no other world: still this good person is here and now
censured by the wise as an immoral person, one of wrong view who
holds the doctrine of nihilism.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote625anc" HREF="#sdendnote625sym"><SUP>dcxxv</SUP></A></SUP>

himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself.</P>
<P  >37.
"What kind of person, householders, torments others and pursues the
practice of torturing others? Here a certain person is a butcher of
sheep … (as Sutta 51, §9) … or one who follows any other such
bloody occupation. This is called the kind of person who torments
others and pursues the practice of torturing others.</P>
<P  >38.
"What kind of a person, householders, torments himself and pursues
the practice of torturing himself and also torments others and
pursues the practice of torturing others? Here some person is a
head-anointed noble king or a well-to-do brahmin … (as Sutta 51,
§10) … And then his slaves, messengers, and servants make
preparations, weeping with tearful faces, being spurred on by threats
of punishment and by fear. This is called the kind of person who
torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself and
who torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others.</P>
<P  >39.
"What kind of person, householders, does not torment himself or
pursue the practice of torturing himself and does not torment others
or pursue the practice of torturing others - the one who, since he
torments neither himself nor others, is here and now hungerless,
extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing bliss, having
himself become holy?</P>
<P  >40-55.
"Here, householders, a Tathagata appears in the world … (as Sutta
51, §§12-27) [413] … He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the
holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is
no more coming to any state of being.'</P>
<P  >56.
"This, householders, is called the kind of person who does not
torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who
does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others -
the one who, since he torments neither himself nor others, is here
and how hungerless, extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing
bliss, having himself become holy."</P>
<P  >57.
When this was said, the brahmin householders of Sala said to the
Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master
Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as
though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a
lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms. We go to
Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama accept us as lay followers who
have gone to him for refuge for life."</P>
