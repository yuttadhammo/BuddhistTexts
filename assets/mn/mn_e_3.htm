3. Dhammadayada Sutta - Heirs in Dhamma</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
Savattht in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote51anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote51sym"><SUP>li</SUP></A></SUP>
- "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things.
Out of compassion for you I have thought: 'How shall my disciples
be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?' If you are
my heirs in material things, not my heirs in Dhamma, you will be
reproached thus: 'The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in
material things, not as heirs in Dhamma'; and I will be reproached
thus: 'The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in material
things, not as his heirs in Dhamma.'</P>
<P  >"If
you are my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things, you will
not be reproached [as it will be said]: 'The Teacher's disciples
live as his heirs in Dhamma, not as his heirs in material things';
and I will not be reproached [as it will be said]: 'The Teacher's
disciples live as his heirs in Dhamma, not as his heirs in material
things.' Therefore, bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs
in material things. Out of compassion for you I have thought: 'How
shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material
things?'</P>
<P  >3.
"Now, bhikkhus, suppose that I had eaten, refused more food, had my
fill, finished, had enough, had what I needed, and some almsfood was
left over to be thrown away. Then two bhikkhus arrived [13] hungry
and weak, and I told them: 'Bhikkhus, I have eaten ... had what I
needed, but there is this almsfood of mine left over to be thrown
away. Eat if you like; if you do not eat then I shall throw it away
where there is no greenery or drop it into water where there is no
life.' Then one bhikkhu thought: 'The Blessed One has eaten ...
had what he needed, but there is this almsfood of the Blessed One
left over to be thrown away; if we do not eat it the Blessed One will
throw it away ... But this has been said by the Blessed One:
"Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things."
Now this almsfood is one of the material things. Suppose that instead
of eating this almsfood I pass the night and day hungry and weak.'
And instead of eating that almsfood he passed that night and day
hungry and weak. Then the second bhikkhu thought: 'The Blessed One
has eaten ... had what he needed, but there is this almsfood of the
Blessed One left over to be thrown away ... Suppose that I eat this
almsfood and pass the night and day neither hungry nor weak.' And
after eating that almsfood he passed the night and day neither hungry
nor weak. Now although that bhikkhu by eating that almsfood passed
the night and day neither hungry nor weak, yet the first bhikkhu is
more to be respected and commended by me. Why is that? Because that
will for long conduce to his fewness of wishes, contentment,
effacement, easy support, and arousal of energy.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote52anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote52sym"><SUP>lii</SUP></A></SUP>
Therefore, bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material
things. Out of compassion for you I have thought: 'How shall my
disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?'"</P>
<P  >4.
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One
rose from his seat and went into his dwelling. Soon after he had
left, the venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Friends,
bhikkhus." - "Friend," they replied. [14] The venerable
Sariputta said this:</P>
<P  >5.
"Friends, in what way do disciples of the Teacher who lives
secluded not train in seclusion? And in what way do disciples of the
Teacher who lives secluded train in seclusion?"</P>
<P  >"Indeed,
friend, we would come from far away to learn from the venerable
Sariputta the meaning of this statement. It would be good if the
venerable Sariputta would explain the meaning of this statement.
Having heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember it."</P>
<P  >"Then,
friends, listen and attend closely to what I shall say." "Yes,
friend," the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Sariputta said this:</P>
<P  >6.
"Friends, in what way do disciples of the Teacher who lives
secluded not train in seclusion? Here disciples of the Teacher who
lives secluded do not train in seclusion; they do not abandon what
the Teacher tells them to abandon; they are luxurious and careless,
leaders in backsliding, neglectful of seclusion.</P>
<P  >"In
this the elder bhikkhus are to be blamed for three reasons.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote53anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote53sym"><SUP>liii</SUP></A></SUP>
As disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded they do not train in
seclusion: they are to be blamed for this first reason. They do not
abandon what the Teacher tells them to abandon: they are to be blamed
for this second reason. They are luxurious and careless, leaders in
backsliding, neglectful of seclusion: they are to be blamed for this
third reason. The elder bhikkhus are to be blamed for these three
reasons.</P>
<P  >"In
this the middle bhikkhus are to be blamed for three reasons. As
disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded they do not train in
seclusion: they are to be blamed for this first reason. They do not
abandon what the Teacher tells them to abandon: they are to be blamed
for this second reason. They are luxurious and careless, leaders in
backsliding, neglectful of seclusion: they are to be blamed for this
third reason. The middle bhikkhus are to be blamed for these three
reasons.</P>
<P  >"In
this the new bhikkhus are to be blamed for three reasons. As
disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded they do not train in
seclusion: they are to be blamed for this first reason. They do not
abandon what the Teacher tells them to abandon: they are to be blamed
for this second reason. They are luxurious and careless, leaders in
backsliding, neglectful of seclusion: they are to be blamed for this
third reason. The new bhikkhus are to be blamed for these three
reasons.</P>
<P  >"It
is in this way that disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded do
not train in seclusion.</P>
<P  >7.
"In what way, friends, do disciples of the Teacher who lives
secluded [15] train in seclusion? Here disciples of the Teacher who
lives secluded train in seclusion; they abandon what the Teacher
tells them to abandon; they are not luxurious and careless, they are
keen to avoid backsliding, and are leaders in seclusion.</P>
<P  >"In
this the elder bhikkhus are to be commended for three reasons. As
disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded they train in seclusion:
they are to be commended for this first reason. They abandon what the
Teacher tells them to abandon: they are to be commended for this
second reason. They are not luxurious and careless; they are keen to
avoid backsliding and are leaders in seclusion: they are to be
commended for this third reason. The elder bhikkhus are to be
commended for these three reasons.</P>
<P  >"In
this the middle bhikkhus are to be commended for three reasons. As
disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded they train in seclusion:
they are to be commended for this first reason. They abandon what the
Teacher tells them to abandon: they are to be commended for this
second reason. They are not luxurious and careless; they are keen to

<P  >"It
is in this way that disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded train
in seclusion.</P>

"Friends, the evil herein is greed and hate.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote54anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote54sym"><SUP>liv</SUP></A></SUP>
There is a Middle Way for the abandoning of greed and hate, giving
vision, giving knowledge, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge,
to enlightenment, to Nibbana. And what is that Middle Way? It is just
this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration. This is the Middle Way giving
vision, giving knowledge, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge,
to enlightenment, to Nibbana.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote55anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote55sym"><SUP>lv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9-15.
"The evil herein is anger and revenge ... contempt and a
domineering attitude ... envy and avarice ... deceit and fraud ...
obstinacy [16] and presumption ... conceit and arrogance ... vanity
and negligence. There is a Middle Way for the abandoning of vanity
and negligence, giving vision, giving knowledge, which leads to
peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. And what is
that Middle Way? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right
view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood,
right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is the
Middle Way giving vision, giving knowledge, which leads to peace, to
direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana."</P>
<P  >That
is what the venerable Sariputta said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the venerable Sariputta's words.</P>
