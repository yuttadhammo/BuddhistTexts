56. Upali Sutta - To Upali</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Nalanda in Pavarika's Mango Grove.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the Nigantha Nataputta was staying at Nalanda
with a large assembly of Niganthas. Then, when the Nigantha [named]
Digha Tapassi<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote578anc" HREF="#sdendnote578sym"><SUP>dlxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
had wandered for alms in Nalanda and had returned from his almsround,
after his meal he went to Pavarika's Mango Grove to see the Blessed
One. [372] He exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and when this
courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one side. As he
stood there, the Blessed One said to him: "There are seats,
Tapassi, sit down if you like."</P>
<P  >3.
When this was said, Digha Tapassi took a low seat and sat down at one
side. Then the Blessed One asked him: "Tapassi, how many kinds of
action does the Nigantha Nataputta describe for the performance of
evil action, for the perpetration of evil action?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Gotama, the Nigantha Nataputta is not accustomed to use the
description 'action, action'; the Nigantha Nataputta is
accustomed to use the description 'rod, rod. '"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote579anc" HREF="#sdendnote579sym"><SUP>dlxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Then,
Tapassi, how many kinds of rod does the Nigantha Nataputta describe
for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil
action?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Gotama, the Nigantha Nataputta describes three kinds of rod for the
performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action; that
is, the bodily rod, the verbal rod, and the mental rod."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote580anc" HREF="#sdendnote580sym"><SUP>dlxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"How
then, Tapassi, is the bodily rod one, the verbal rod another, and the
mental rod still another?"</P>
<P  >"The
bodily rod is one, friend Gotama, the verbal rod is another, and the
mental rod is still another."</P>
<P  >"Of
these three kinds of rod, Tapassi, thus analysed and distinguished,
which kind of rod does the Nigantha Nataputta describe as the most
reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action: the bodily rod or the verbal rod or the
mental rod?"</P>
<P  >"Of
these three kinds of rod, friend Gotama, thus analysed and
distinguished, the Nigantha Nataputta describes the bodily rod as the
most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the
mental rod."</P>
<P  >"Do
you say the bodily rod, Tapassi?"</P>
<P  >"I
say the bodily rod, friend Gotama."</P>
<P  >"Do
you say the bodily rod, Tapassi?"</P>
<P  >"I
say the bodily rod, friend Gotama."</P>
<P  >"Do
you say the bodily rod, Tapassi?"</P>
<P  >"I
say the bodily rod, friend Gotama."</P>
<P  >Thus
the Blessed One made the Nigantha Digha Tapassi maintain his
statement up to the third time. [373]</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Nigantha Digha Tapassi asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >"And
you, friend Gotama, how many kinds of rod do you describe for the
performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action?"</P>
<P  >"Tapassi,
the Tathagata is not accustomed to use the description 'rod, rod';
the Tathagata is accustomed to use the description 'action,
action.'"</P>
<P  >"But,
friend Gotama, how many kinds of action do you describe for the
performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action?"</P>
<P  >"Tapassi,
I describe three kinds of action for the performance of evil action,
for the perpetration of evil action: that is, bodily action, verbal
action, and mental action."</P>
<P  >"How
then, friend Gotama, is bodily action one, verbal action another, and
mental action still another?"</P>
<P  >"Bodily
action is one, Tapassi, verbal action is another, and mental action
is still another."</P>
<P  >"Of
these three kinds of action, friend Gotama, thus analysed and
distinguished, which kind of action do you describe as the most
reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action: bodily action or verbal action or mental
action?"</P>
<P  >"Of
these three kinds of action, Tapassi, thus analysed and
distinguished, I describe mental action as the most reprehensible for
the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action,
and not so much bodily action and verbal action."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote581anc" HREF="#sdendnote581sym"><SUP>dlxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Do
you say mental action, friend Gotama?"</P>
<P  >"I
say mental action, Tapassi."</P>
<P  >"Do
you say mental action, friend Gotama?"</P>
<P  >"I
say mental action, Tapassi."</P>
<P  >"Do
you say mental action, friend Gotama?"</P>
<P  >"I
say mental action, Tapassi."</P>
<P  >Thus
the Nigantha Digha Tapassi made the Blessed One maintain his
statement up to the third time, after which he rose from his seat and
went to the Nigantha Nataputta.</P>
<P  >5.
Now on that occasion the Nigantha Nataputta was seated together with
a very large assembly of laymen from Balaka, most prominent among
them being Upali. The Nigantha Nataputta saw the Nigantha Digha
Tapassi coming in the distance and asked him: "Now where are you
coming from in the middle of the day, Tapassi?"</P>
<P  >"I
am coming from the presence of the recluse Gotama, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"Did
you have some conversation with the recluse Gotama, Tapassi?" [374]</P>
<P  >"I
had some conversation with the recluse Gotama, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"What
was your conversation with him like, Tapassi?"</P>
<P  >Then
the Nigantha Digha Tapassi related to the Nigantha Nataputta his
entire conversation with the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >6.
When this was said, the Nigantha Nataputta told him: "Good, good,
Tapassi! The Nigantha Digha Tapassi has answered the recluse Gotama
like a well-taught disciple who understands his teacher's
dispensation rightly. What does the trivial mental rod count for in
comparison with the gross bodily rod? On the contrary, the bodily rod
is the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the
mental rod."</P>
<P  >7.
When this was said, the householder Upali said to the Nigantha
Nataputta: "Good, good, venerable sir, [on the part of] Digha
Tapassi! The venerable Tapassi has answered the recluse Gotama like a
well-taught disciple who understands his teacher's dispensation
rightly. What does the trivial mental rod count for in comparison
with the gross bodily rod? On the contrary, the bodily rod is the
most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the
mental rod. Now, venerable sir, I shall go and refute the recluse
Gotama's doctrine on the basis of this statement. If the recluse
Gotama maintains before me what the venerable Digha Tapassi made him
maintain, then just as a strong man<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote582anc" HREF="#sdendnote582sym"><SUP>dlxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
might seize a long-haired ram by the hair and drag him to and drag
him fro and drag him round about, so in debate I will drag the
recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag him round about. Just as
a strong brewer's workman might throw a big brewer's sieve into a
deep water tank, and taking it by the corners, might drag it to and
drag it fro and drag it round about, so in debate I will drag the
recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag him round about. Just as
a strong brewer's mixer might take a strainer by the corners and
shake it down and shake it up and thump it about, so in debate I will
shake the recluse Gotama down [375] and shake him up and thump him
about. And just as a sixty-year-old elephant might plunge into a deep
pond and enjoy playing the game of hemp-washing, so I shall enjoy
playing the game of hemp-washing with the recluse Gotama. Venerable
sir, I shall go and refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine on the
basis of this statement."</P>
<P  >"Go,
householder, and refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine on the basis
of this statement. For either I should refute the recluse Gotama's
doctrine or else the Nigantha Digha Tapassi or you yourself."</P>
<P  >8.
When this was said, the Nigantha Digha Tapassi said to the Nigantha
Nataputta: "Venerable sir, I do not think that the householder
Upali should [try to] refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine. For the
recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting magic by which he
converts disciples of other sectarians."</P>
<P  >"It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen that the householder Upali
should go over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama; but it is
possible, it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to
discipleship under the householder Upali. Go, householder, and refute
the recluse Gotama's doctrine. For either I should refute the
recluse Gotama's doctrine or else the Nigantha Digha Tapassi or you
yourself."</P>
<P  >For
the second time … For the third time, the Nigantha Digha Tapassi
said to the Nigantha Nataputta: "Venerable sir, I do not think that
the householder Upali should [try to] refute the recluse Gotama's
doctrine. For the recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting
magic by which he converts disciples of other sectarians."</P>
<P  >"It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen that the householder Upali
should go over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama; but it is
possible, it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to
discipleship under the householder Upali. Go, householder, and refute
the recluse Gotama's doctrine. For either I should refute the
recluse Gotama's doctrine or else the Nigantha Digha Tapassi or you
yourself."</P>
<P  >9.
"Yes, venerable sir," the householder Upali replied, and he rose
from his seat, and after paying homage to the Nigantha Nataputta,
keeping him on his right, he left to go to the Blessed One in
Pavarika's Mango Grove. [376] There, after paying homage to the
Blessed One, he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed One:
"Venerable sir, did the Nigantha Digha Tapassi come here?"</P>
<P  >"The
Nigantha Digha Tapassi came here, householder."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, did you have some conversation with him?"</P>
<P  >"I
had some conversation with him, householder."</P>
<P  >"What
was your conversation with him like, venerable sir?"</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One related to the householder Upali his entire
conversation with the Nigantha Digha Tapassi.</P>
<P  >10.
When this was said, the householder Upali said to the Blessed One:
"Good, good, venerable sir, on the part of Tapassi! The Nigantha
Digha Tapassi has answered the Blessed One like a well-taught
disciple who understands his teacher's dispensation rightly. What
does the trivial mental rod count for in comparison with the gross
bodily rod? On the contrary, the bodily rod is the most reprehensible
for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil
action, and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rod."</P>
<P  >"Householder,
if you will debate on the basis of truth, we might have some
conversation about this."</P>
<P  >"I
will debate on the basis of truth, venerable sir, so let us have some
conversation about this."</P>
<P  >11.
"What do you think, householder? Here some Nigantha might be
afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill [with an illness</P>
<P  >needing
treatment by cold water, which his vows prohibit] and he might refuse
cold water [though mentally longing for it] and use only [the
permissible] hot water [thus keeping his vows bodily and verbally].
Because he does not get cold water he might die. Now, householder,
where would the Nigantha Nataputta describe his rebirth [as taking
place]?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, there are gods called 'mind-bound'; he would be reborn
there. Why is that? Because when he died he was still bound [by
attachment] in the mind."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote583anc" HREF="#sdendnote583sym"><SUP>dlxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Householder,
householder, pay attention how you reply! What you said before does
not agree with what you said afterwards, nor does what you said
afterwards agree with what you said before. Yet you made this
statement: 'I will debate on the basis of truth, venerable sir, so
let us have some conversation about this.'"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, although the Blessed One has spoken thus, yet the bodily rod is
the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the
mental rod."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote584anc" HREF="#sdendnote584sym"><SUP>dlxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
"What do you think, [377] householder? Here some Nigantha might be
restrained with four checks - curbed by all curbs, clamped by all
curbs, cleansed by all curbs, and claimed by all curbs<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote585anc" HREF="#sdendnote585sym"><SUP>dlxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
- and yet when going forward and returning he brings about the
destruction of many small living beings. What result does the
Nigantha Nataputta describe for him?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, the Nigantha Nataputta does not describe what is not willed as
greatly reprehensible."</P>
<P  >"But
if one wills it, householder?"</P>
<P  >"Then
it is greatly reprehensible, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"But
under which [of the three rods] does the Nigantha Nataputta describe
willing, householder?"</P>
<P  >"Under
the mental rod, venerable sir."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote586anc" HREF="#sdendnote586sym"><SUP>dlxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Householder,
householder, pay attention how you reply! What you said before does
not agree with what you said afterwards, nor does what you said
afterwards agree with what you said before. Yet you made this
statement: 'I will debate on the basis of truth, venerable sir, so

<P  >"Venerable
sir, although the Blessed One has spoken thus, yet the bodily rod is
the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the
mental rod."</P>
<P  >13.
"What do you think, householder? Is this town of Nalanda successful
and prosperous, is it populous and crowded with people?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir, it is."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, householder? Suppose a man came here brandishing a
sword and spoke thus: 'In one moment, in one instant, I will make
all the living beings in this town of Nalanda into one mass of flesh,
into one heap of flesh.' What do you think, householder, would that
man be able to do that?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or even fifty men would not be able
to make all the living beings in this town of</P>
<P  >Nalanda
into one mass of flesh, into one heap of flesh in one moment or
instant, so what does a single trivial man count for?"</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, householder? Suppose some recluse or brahmin came here
possessed of supernormal power and attained to mastery of mind, and
he spoke thus: 'I will reduce this town of Nalanda to ashes with
one mental act of hate.' What do you think, householder, would such
a recluse or brahmin be able to do that?" [378]</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, such a recluse or brahmin possessed of supernormal power and
attained to mastery of mind would be able to reduce ten, twenty,
thirty, forty, or even fifty Nalandas to ashes with one mental act of
hate, so what does a single trivial Nalanda count for?"</P>
<P  >"Householder,
householder, pay attention how you reply! What you said before does
not agree with what you said afterwards, nor does what you said

<P  >"Venerable
sir, although the Blessed One has spoken thus, yet the bodily rod is
the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the

<P  >14.
"What do you think, householder? Have you heard how the Dandaka,
Kalinga, Mejjha, and Matanga forests became forests?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote587anc" HREF="#sdendnote587sym"><SUP>dlxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
- "Yes, venerable sir." - "As you heard it, how did they become
forests?" - "Venerable sir, I heard that they became forests by
means of a mental act of hate on the part of the seers."</P>
<P  >"Householder,
householder, pay attention how you reply! What you said before does
not agree with what you said afterwards, nor does what you said
afterwards agree with what you said before. Yet you made this
statement: 'I will debate on the basis of truth, venerable sir, so
let us have some conversation about this.'"</P>
<P  >15.
"Venerable sir, I was satisfied and pleased by the Blessed One's
very first simile. Nevertheless, I thought I would oppose the Blessed
One thus since I desired to hear the Blessed One's varied solutions
to the problem. Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable
sir! The Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as
though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a
lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. Venerable sir,
I go to the Blessed One for refuge [379] and to the Dhamma and to the
Sangha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower
who has gone to him for refuge for life."</P>
<P  >16.
"Investigate thoroughly, householder. It is good for such
well-known people like you to investigate thoroughly."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed One for
telling me that. For the other sectarians, on acquiring me as their
disciple, would carry a banner all over Nalanda announcing: 'The
householder Upali has come to discipleship under us.' But, on the
contrary, the Blessed One tells me: 'Investigate thoroughly,
householder. It is good for such well-known people like you to
investigate thoroughly.' So for the second time, venerable sir, I
go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha
of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who
has gone to him for refuge for life."</P>
<P  >17.
"Householder, your family has long supported the Niganthas and you
should consider that alms should be given to them when they come."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed One for
telling me that. Venerable sir, I have heard that the recluse Gotama
says thus: 'Gifts should be given only to me; gifts should not be
given to others. Gifts should be given only to my disciples; gifts
should not be given to others' disciples. Only what is given to me
is very fruitful, not what is given to others.</P>
<P  >Only
what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to
others' disciples.' But, on the contrary, the Blessed One
encourages me to give gifts to the Niganthas. Anyway we shall know
the time for that, venerable sir. So for the third time, venerable
sir, I go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the
Sangha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower
who has gone to him for refuge for life."</P>
<P  >18.
Then the Blessed One gave the householder Upali progressive
instruction, that is, talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on the
heavens; he explained the danger, degradation, and defilement in
sensual pleasures and the blessing of renunciation. When he knew that
the householder Upali's mind [380] was ready, receptive, free from
hindrances, elated, and confident, he expounded to him the teaching
special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the
path. Just as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye
evenly, so too, while the householder Upali sat there, the spotless
immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him: "All that is subject
to arising is subject to cessation."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote588anc" HREF="#sdendnote588sym"><SUP>dlxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the householder Upali saw the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma; he crossed beyond doubt,
did away with perplexity, gained intrepidity, and became independent
of others in the Teacher's Dispensation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote589anc" HREF="#sdendnote589sym"><SUP>dlxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Then he said to the Blessed One: "Now, venerable sir, we must go.
We are busy and have much to do."</P>
<P  >"Now
is the time, householder, to do as you think fit."</P>
<P  >19.
Then the householder Upali, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to
the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he left to return to his
own house. There he addressed the doorkeeper thus: "Good
doorkeeper, from today on I close my door to the Niganthas and the
Niganthas, and I open my door to the Blessed One's bhikkhus,
bhikkhunas, men lay followers, and women lay followers. If any
Nigantha comes, then tell him thus: 'Wait, venerable sir, do not
enter. From today on the householder Upali has gone over to
discipleship under the recluse Gotama. He has closed his door to the
Niganthas and Niganthas, and he has opened it to the Blessed One's
bhikkhus, bhikkhunas, men lay followers, and women lay followers.
Venerable sir, if you need alms, wait here; they will bring it to you
here.'"- "Yes, venerable sir," the doorkeeper replied.</P>
<P  >20.
The Nigantha Digha Tapassi heard: "The householder Upali has gone
over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama." Then he went to the
Nigantha Nataputta and told him: "Venerable sir, I have heard thus:
'The householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the
recluse Gotama.'"</P>
<P  >"It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen that the householder Upali
should go over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama; but it is
possible, it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to
discipleship under the householder Upali." [381]</P>
<P  >A
second time … And a third time the Nigantha Digha Tapassi told the
Nigantha Nataputta: "Venerable sir, I have heard thus: 'The
householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse
Gotama.'"</P>
<P  >"It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen … "</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, shall I go and find out whether or not the householder Upali has
gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama?"</P>
<P  >"Go,
Tapassi, and find out whether or not he has gone over to discipleship
under the recluse Gotama."</P>
<P  >21.
Then the Nigantha Digha Tapassi went to the householder Upali's
house. The doorkeeper saw him coming in the distance and told him:
"Wait, venerable sir, do not enter. From today on the householder
Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama. He has
closed his door to the Niganthas and Niganthas, and he has opened it
to the Blessed One's bhikkhus, bhikkhunas, men lay followers, and
women lay followers. Venerable sir, if you need alms, wait here; they
will bring it to you here."</P>
<P  >"I
do not need alms, friend," he said, and he turned back and went to
the Nigantha Nataputta and told him: "Venerable sir, it is only too
true that the householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under
the recluse Gotama. Venerable sir, I did not get your consent when I
told you: 'Venerable sir, I do not think that the householder Upali
should [try to] refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine. For the
recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting magic by which he
converts disciples of other sectarians.' And now, venerable sir,
your householder Upali has been converted by the recluse Gotama with
his converting magic!"</P>
<P  >"It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen that the householder Upali
should go over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama; but it is
possible, it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to
discipleship under the householder Upali."</P>
<P  >A
second time … And a third time the Nigantha Digha Tapassi told the
Nigantha Nataputta: "Venerable sir, it is only too true that the
householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse
Gotama [382] … with his converting magic!"</P>
<P  >"It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen … it can happen that the
recluse Gotama might come over to discipleship under the householder
Upali. Now I shall go myself and find out whether or not he has gone
over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama."</P>
<P  >22.
Then the Nigantha Nataputta went with a large assembly of Niganthas
to the householder Upali s house. The doorkeeper saw him coming in
the distance and told him: "Wait, venerable sir, do not enter. From
today on the householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under
the recluse Gotama. He has closed his door to the Niganthas and
Niganthas, and he has opened his door to the Blessed One's
bhikkhus, bhikkhunas, men lay followers, and women lay followers.
Venerable sir, if you need alms, wait here; they will bring it to you
here."</P>
<P  >"Good
doorkeeper, go to the householder Upali and tell him: 'Venerable
sir, the Nigantha Nataputta is standing at the outer gate with a
large assembly of Niganthas; he wishes to see you.'"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," he replied, and he went to the householder Upali
and told him: "Venerable sir, the Nigantha Nataputta is standing at
the outer gate with a large assembly of Niganthas; he wishes to see
you."</P>
<P  >"In
that case, good doorkeeper, make seats ready in the hall of the
central door."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," he replied, and after he had made seats ready in
the hall of the central door, he returned to the householder Upali
and told him: "Venerable sir, the seats are made ready in the hall
of the central door. Now it is time to do as you think fit."</P>
<P  >23.
Then the householder Upali [383] went to the hall of the central door
and sat down on the highest, best, chief, most excellent seat there.
Then he told the doorkeeper: "Now, good doorkeeper, go to the
Nigantha Nataputta and tell him:</P>
<P  >'Venerable
sir, the householder Upali says: "Enter, venerable sir, if you
wish.""</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," he replied, and he went to the Nigantha Nataputta
and told him: "Venerable sir, the householder Upali says: 'Enter,
venerable sir, if you wish.'"</P>
<P  >Then
the Nigantha Nataputta went with the large assembly of Niganthas to
the hall of the central door.</P>
<P  >24.
Previously, when the householder Upali saw the Nigantha Nataputta
coming in the distance, he used to go out to meet him, dust off the
highest, best, chief, most excellent seat there with an upper robe,
and having arranged it all around, have him seated on it. But now,
while seated himself on the highest, best, chief, most excellent
seat, he told Nigantha Nataputta: "Venerable sir, there are seats;
sit down if you wish."</P>
<P  >25.
When this was said, the Nigantha Nataputta said: "Householder, you
are mad, you are an imbecile. You went saying: 'Venerable sir, I
shall refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine,' and you have come
back all caught up in a vast net of doctrine. Just as if a man went
to castrate someone and came back castrated on both sides, just as if
a man went to put out someone's eyes and came back with both his
eyes put out; so you too, householder, went saying: 'Venerable sir,
I shall refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine,' and you have come
back all caught up in a vast net of doctrine. Householder, you have
been converted by the recluse Gotama with his converting magic!"</P>
<P  >26.
"Auspicious is that converting magic, venerable sir, good is that
converting magic!<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote590anc" HREF="#sdendnote590sym"><SUP>dxc</SUP></A></SUP>
Venerable sir, if my beloved kinsmen and relatives were to be
converted by this conversion, it would lead to the welfare and
happiness of my beloved kinsmen and relatives for a long time. If all
nobles were to be converted by this conversion, it would lead to the
welfare and happiness of the nobles for a long time. [384] If all
brahmins … all merchants … all workers were to be converted by
this conversion, it would lead to the welfare and happiness of the
workers for a long time. If the world with its gods, its Maras, and
its Brahmas, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its
princes and its people, were to be converted by this conversion, it
would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long time.
As to this, venerable sir, I shall give you a simile; for some wise
men here understand the meaning of a statement by a simile.</P>
<P  >27.
"Venerable sir, there was once a brahmin who was old, aged, and
burdened with years, and he had as a wife a young brahmin girl who
was pregnant and near her confinement. Then she told him: 'Go,
brahmin, buy a young monkey in the market and bring it back to me as
a playmate for my child.' He replied: 'Wait, madam, till you have
borne the child. If you bear a boy, then I will go to the market and
buy a young male monkey and bring it back to you as a playmate for
your little boy; but if you bear a girl, then I will go to the market
and buy a young female monkey and bring it back to you as a playmate
for your little girl.' For the second time she made the same
request and received the same answer. For the third time she made the
same request. Then, since his mind was bound to her with love, he
went to the market, bought a young male monkey, brought it back, and
told her: 'I have bought this young male monkey in the market [385]
and brought it back to you as a playmate for your child.' Then she
told him: 'Go, brahmin, take this young male monkey to Rattapani
the dyer's son and tell him: "Good Rattapani, I want this young
male monkey dyed the colour called yellow-unguent, pounded and
re-pounded, and smoothened out on both sides.'"Then, since his
mind was bound to her with love, he took the young male monkey to
Rattapani the dyer's son and told him: 'Good Rattapani, I want
this young male monkey dyed the colour called yellow-unguent, pounded
and re-pounded, and smoothened out on both sides.' Rattapani the
dyer's son told him: 'Venerable sir, this young male monkey will
take a dyeing but not a pounding or a smoothening out.' So too,
venerable sir, the doctrine of the foolish Niganthas will give
delight to fools but not to the wise, and it will not withstand
testing or being smoothened out.</P>
<P  >"Then,
venerable sir, on another occasion that brahmin took a pair of new
garments to Rattapani the dyer's son and told him: 'Good
Rattapani, I want this pair of new garments dyed the colour called
yellow-unguent, pounded and re-pounded, and smoothened out on both
sides.' Rattapani the dyer's son told him: 'Venerable sir, this
pair of new garments will take a dyeing and a pounding and a
smoothening out.' So too, venerable sir, the doctrine of that
Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, will give delight to
the wise but not to fools, and it will withstand testing and being
smoothened out."</P>

"Householder, the assembly and the king know you thus: 'The

arranging his upper robe on one shoulder, [3861 he extended his hands

"When did you concoct that hymn of praise to the recluse Gotama,
householder?</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, suppose there were a great heap of many kinds of flowers, [387]
and then a clever garland-maker or garland-maker's apprentice were
to knot them into a multicoloured garland; so too, venerable sir, the
Blessed One has many praiseworthy qualities, many hundred
praiseworthy qualities. Who, venerable sir, would not praise the
praiseworthy?</P>

Then, since the Nigantha Nataputta was unable to bear this honour
done to the Blessed One, hot blood then and there gushed from his
