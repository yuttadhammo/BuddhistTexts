120. Sankharupapatti Sutta - Reappearance by Aspiration</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you reappearance in accordance with one's
aspiration.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1132anc" HREF="#sdendnote1132sym"><SUP>mcxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." - "Yes, venerable
sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu possesses faith, virtue, learning,
generosity, and wisdom. He thinks: 'Oh, that on the dissolution of
the body, after death, I might reappear in the company of well-todo
nobles!' He fixes his mind on that, establishes it, develops it.
[100] These aspirations and this abiding of his, thus developed and
cultivated, lead to his reappearance there. This, bhikkhus, is the
path, the way that leads to reappearance there.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1133anc" HREF="#sdendnote1133sym"><SUP>mcxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4-5.
"Again, a bhikkhu possesses faith … and wisdom. He thinks: 'Oh,
that on the dissolution of the body, after death, I might reappear in
the company of well-to-do brahmins! … in the company of well-to-do
householders!' He fixes his mind on that … This, bhikkhus, is the
path, the way that leads to reappearance there.</P>
<P  >6.
"Again, a bhikkhu possesses faith … and wisdom. He hears that the
gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings are longlived, beautiful,
and enjoy great happiness. He thinks: 'Oh, that on the dissolution
of the body, after death, I might reappear in the company of the gods
of the heaven of the Four Great Kings!' He fixes his mind on that …
This, bhikkhus, is the path, the way that leads to reappearance
there.</P>
<P  >7-11.
"Again, a bhikkhu possesses faith … and wisdom. He hears that the
gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three … the Yama gods … the gods
of the Tusita heaven … the gods who delight in creating.. .the gods
who wield power over others' creations are long-lived, beautiful,
and enjoy great happiness. He thinks: 'Oh, that on the dissolution
of the body, after death, I might reappear in the company of the gods
who wield power over others' creations!' He fixes his mind on
that … This, bhikkhus, is the path, the way that leads to
reappearance there.</P>
<P  >12.
"Again, a bhikkhu possesses faith [101] … and wisdom. He hears
that the Brahma of a Thousand is long-lived, beautiful, and enjoys
great happiness. Now the Brahma of a Thousand abides intent on
pervading a world-system of a thousand worlds, and he abides intent
on pervading the beings that have reappeared there.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1134anc" HREF="#sdendnote1134sym"><SUP>mcxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as a man with. good sight might take a gallnut in his hand and
review it, so the Brahma of a Thousand abides intent on pervading a
world-system of a thousand [worlds], and he abides intent on
pervading the beings that have reappeared there. The bhikkhu thinks:
'Oh, that on the dissolution of the body, after death, I might
reappear in the company of the Brahma of a Thousand!' He fixes his
mind on that … This, bhikkhus, is the path, the way that leads to
reappearance there.</P>
<P  >13-16.
"Again, a bhikkhu possesses faith … and wisdom. He hears that the
Brahma of Two Thousand … the Brahma of Three Thousand … the
Brahma of Four Thousand … the Brahma of Five Thousand is
long-lived, beautiful, and enjoys great happiness. Now the Brahma of
Five Thousand abides intent on pervading a world-system of five
thousand worlds, and he abides intent on pervading the beings that
have reappeared there. Just as a man with good sight might take five
gallnuts in his hand and review them, so the Brahma of Five Thousand
abides intent on pervading a world-system of five thousand worlds,
and he abides intent on pervading the beings that have reappeared
there. The bhikkhu thinks: 'Oh, that on the dissolution of the
body, after death, I might reappear in the company of the Brahma of
Five Thousand!' He fixes his mind on that … This, bhikkhus, is
the path, the way that leads to reappearance there.</P>
<P  >17.
"Again, a bhikkhu possesses faith … and wisdom. He hears that the
Brahma of Ten Thousand is long-lived, beautiful, and enjoys great
happiness. Now the Brahma of Ten Thousand abides intent on pervading
[102] a world-system of ten thousand worlds, and he abides intent on
pervading the beings that have reappeared there. Just as a fine beryl
gem of purest water, eightfaceted, well cut, lying on red brocade,
glows, radiates, and shines, so the Brahma of Ten Thousand abides
intent on pervading a world-system of ten thousand worlds, and he
abides intent on pervading the beings that have reappeared there. The
bhikkhu thinks: 'Oh, that on the dissolution of the body, after
death, I might reappear in the company of the Brahma of Ten
Thousand!' He fixes his mind on that … This, bhikkhus, is the
path, the way that leads to reappearance there.</P>
<P  >18.
"Again, a bhikkhu possesses faith … and wisdom. He hears that the
Brahma of a Hundred Thousand is long-lived, beautiful, and enjoys
great happiness. Now the Brahma of a Hundred Thousand abides intent
on pervading a world-system of a hundred thousand worlds, and he
abides intent on pervading the beings that have reappeared there.
Just as an ornament of finest gold, very skilfully wrought in the
furnace by a clever goldsmith, lying on red brocade, glows, radiates,
and shines, so the Brahma of a Hundred Thousand abides intent on
pervading a world-system of a hundred thousand worlds, and he abides
intent on pervading the beings that have reappeared there. The
bhikkhu thinks: 'Oh, that on the dissolution of the body, after
death, I might reappear in the company of the Brahma of a Hundred
Thousand!' He fixes his mind on that … This, bhikkhus, is the
path, the way that leads to reappearance there.</P>
<P  >19-32.
"Again, a bhikkhu possesses faith … and wisdom. He hears that the
gods of Radiance<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1135anc" HREF="#sdendnote1135sym"><SUP>mcxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
… tgods of Limited Radiance … the gods of Immeasurable Radiance …

Limited Glory … the gods of Immeasurable Glory … the gods of
Refulgent Glory … [103] … the gods of Great Fruit … the Aviha
gods … the Atappa gods … the Sudassa gods … the Sudassi gods …
the Akanittha gods are long-lived, beautiful, and enjoy great

gods of the base of infinite space … the gods of the base of
infinite consciousness … the gods of the base of nothingness …

that on the dissolution of the body, after death, I might reappear in
the company of the gods of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception!' He fixes his mind on that,
establishes it, develops it. These aspirations and this abiding of
his, thus developed and cultivated, lead to his reappearance there.
This, bhikkhus, is the path, the way that leads to reappearance
there.</P>
<P  >37.
"Again, a bhikkhu possesses faith, virtue, learning, generosity,
and wisdom. He thinks: 'Oh, that by realising for myself with
direct knowledge, I might here and now enter upon and abide in the
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with
the destruction of the taints!' And by realising for himself with
direct knowledge, he here and now enters upon and abides in the
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with
the destruction of the taints. Bhikkhus, this bhikkhu does not
reappear anywhere at all."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1136anc" HREF="#sdendnote1136sym"><SUP>mcxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
