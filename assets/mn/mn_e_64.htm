64. Mahamalunkya Sutta - The Greater Discourse to<BR>Malunkyaputta</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, do you remember the five lower fetters as taught by me?"</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the venerable Malunkyaputta replied: "Venerable sir,
I remember the five lower fetters as taught by the Blessed One."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote649anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote649sym"><SUP>dcxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"But,
Malunkyaputta, in what way do you remember the five lower fetters as
taught by me?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, I remember personality view as a lower fetter taught by the
Blessed One. I remember doubt as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed
One. I remember adherence to rules and observances as a lower fetter
taught by the Blessed One. I remember sensual desire as a lower
fetter taught by the Blessed One. I remember ill will as a lower
fetter taught by the Blessed One. It is in this way, venerable sir,
that I remember the five lower fetters as taught by the Blessed One."</P>
<P  >3.
"Malunkyaputta, to whom do you remember my having taught these five
lower fetters in that way?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote650anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote650sym"><SUP>dcl</SUP></A></SUP>
Would not the wanderers of other sects confute you with the simile of
the infant? For a young tender infant lying prone does not even have
the notion 'personality,' [433] so how could personality view
arise in him? Yet the underlying tendency to personality view lies
within him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote651anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote651sym"><SUP>dcli</SUP></A></SUP>
A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion
'teachings,'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote652anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote652sym"><SUP>dclii</SUP></A></SUP>
so how could doubt about teachings arise in him? Yet the underlying
tendency to doubt lies within him. A young tender infant lying prone
does not even have the notion 'rules,' so how could adherence to
rules and observances arise in him? Yet the underlying tendency to
adhere to rules and observances lies within him. A young tender
infant lying prone does not even have the notion 'sensual
pleasures,' so how could sensual desire arise in him? Yet the
underlying tendency to sensual lust lies within him. A young tender
infant lying prone does not even have the notion 'beings,' so how
could ill will towards beings arise in him? Yet the underlying
tendency to ill will lies within him. Would not the wanderers of
other sects confute you with this simile of the infant?"</P>
<P  >4.
Thereupon, the venerable Ananda said: "It is the time, Blessed One,
it is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One to teach the five
lower fetters. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus
will remember it."</P>
<P  >"Then
listen, Ananda, and attend closely to what I shall say." "Yes,
venerable sir," the venerable Ananda replied. The Blessed One said
this:</P>
<P  >5.
"Here, Ananda, an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for
noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who
has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in
their Dhamma, abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by personality
view, and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from
the arisen personality view; and when that personality view has
become habitual and is uneradicated in him, it is a lower fetter. He
abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by doubt ... by adherence to
rules and observances ... by sensual lust [434] ... by ill will, and
he does not understand as it actually is the escape from arisen ill
will; and when that ill will has become habitual and is uneradicated
in him, it is a lower fetter.</P>
<P  >6.
"A well-taught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and is
skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for true men
and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not abide with a
mind obsessed and enslaved by personality view; he understands as it
actually is the escape from the arisen personality view, and
personality view together with the underlying tendency to it is
abandoned in him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote653anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote653sym"><SUP>dcliii</SUP></A></SUP>
He does not abide with a mind obsessed and enslaved by doubt ... by
adherence to rules and observances ... by sensual lust ... by ill
will; he understands as it actually is the escape from the arisen ill
will, and ill will together with the underlying tendency to it is
abandoned in him.</P>
<P  >7.
"There is a path, Ananda, a way to the abandoning of the five lower
fetters; that anyone, without coming to that path, to that way, shall
know or see or abandon the five lower fetters - this is not possible.
Just as when there is a great tree standing possessed of heartwood,
it is not possible that anyone shall cut out its heartwood without
cutting through its bark and sapwood, so too, there is a path ...
this is not possible.</P>
<P  >"There
is a path, Ananda, a way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters;
[435] that someone, by coming to that path, to that way, shall know

"Suppose, Ananda, the river Ganges were full of water right up to
the brim so that crows could drink from it, and then a feeble man
came thinking: 'By swimming across the stream with my arms, I shall
get safely across to the further shore of this river Ganges'; yet
he would not be able to get safely across. So too, when the Dhamma is
being taught to someone for the cessation of personality, if his mind
does not enter into it and acquire confidence, steadiness, and
decision, then he can be regarded as like the feeble man.</P>
<P  >"Suppose,
Ananda, the river Ganges were full of water right up to the brim so
that crows could drink from it, and then a strong man came thinking:
'By swimming across the stream with my arms, I shall get safely

someone for the cessation of personality, if his mind enters into it

<P  >9.
"And what, Ananda, is the path, the way to the abandoning of the
five lower fetters? Here, with seclusion from objects of attachment<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote654anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote654sym"><SUP>dcliv</SUP></A></SUP>
with the abandoning of unwholesome states, with the complete
tranquillization of bodily inertia, quite secluded from sensual
pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon
and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</P>
<P  >"Whatever
exists therein of material form, feeling, perception, formations, and
consciousness, he sees those states as impermanent, as suffering, as
a disease, as a tumour, as a barb, as a calamity, as an affliction,
as alien, as disintegrating, as void, as not self.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote655anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote655sym"><SUP>dclv</SUP></A></SUP>
He turns his mind away from those states [436] and directs it towards
the deathless element thus: 'This is the peaceful, this is the
sublime, that is, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing
of all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion,
cessation, Nibbana.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote656anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote656sym"><SUP>dclvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Standing upon that, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if
he does not attain the destruction of the taints, then because of
that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote657anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote657sym"><SUP>dclvii</SUP></A></SUP>
with the destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one due to
reappear spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain final
Nibbana without ever returning from that world. This is the path, the
way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters.</P>
<P  >10-12.
"Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana ... Again, with
the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu ... enters upon and
abides in the third jhana ... Again, with the abandoning of pleasure
and pain ... a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana,
which has neither-painnor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity.</P>
<P  >"Whatever
exists therein of material form, feeling, perception, formations, and
consciousness, he sees those states as impermanent ... as not self.
He turns his mind away from those states and directs it towards the
deathless element ... This is the path, the way to the abandoning of
the five lower fetters.</P>
<P  >13.
"Again, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with
the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is
infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite
space.</P>

exists therein of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote658anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote658sym"><SUP>dclviii</SUP></A></SUP>

mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless
element ... This is the path, the way to the abandoning of the five
lower fetters.</P>
<P  >14.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware
that 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the base of infinite consciousness.</P>
<P  >"Whatever
exists therein of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness,
he sees those states as impermanent ... as not self. He turns his
mind away from those states and directs it towards the deathless
element ... This is the path, the way to the abandoning of the five
lower fetters.</P>
<P  >15.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the base of nothingness.</P>
<P  >"Whatever
exists therein of feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness,
he sees those states as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a
tumour, as a barb, as a calamity, as an affliction, as alien, as

those states and directs it towards the deathless element thus: 'This
is the peaceful, this is the sublime, that is, the stilling of all

he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain
the destruction of the taints, then because of that desire for the
Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, with the destruction of the five
lower fetters he becomes one due to reappear spontaneously [in the
Pure Abodes] and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning
from that world. This is the path, the way to the abandoning of the
five lower fetters."</P>
<P  >16.
"Venerable sir, if this is the path, the way to the abandoning of
the five lower fetters, then how is it that some bhikkhus here [are
said to] gain deliverance of mind and some [are said to] gain
deliverance by wisdom?"</P>
<P  >"The
difference here, Ananda, is in their faculties, I say."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote659anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote659sym"><SUP>dclix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
