57. Kukkuravatika Sutta - The Dog-duty Ascetic</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Koliyan country at a town of the Koliyans named Haliddavasana.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Punna, son of the Koliyans, an ox-duty ascetic, and also Seniya,
a naked dog-duty ascetic, went to the Blessed One.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote600anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote600sym"><SUP>dc</SUP></A></SUP>
Punna, the ox-duty ascetic, paid homage to the Blessed One and sat
down at one side, while Seniya, the naked dog-duty ascetic, exchanged
greetings with the Blessed One, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he too sat down at one side curled up like a dog.
Punna, the ox-duty ascetic, said to the Blessed One: "Venerable
sir, this Seniya is a naked dogduty ascetic who does what is hard to
do: he eats his food when it is thrown to the ground. He has long
taken up and practised that dog-duty. What will be his destination?
What will be his future course?"</P>
<P  >"Enough,
Punna, let that be. Do not ask me that."</P>
<P  >A
second time ... And a third time Punna, the ox-duty ascetic, said to
the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, this Seniya is a naked dog-duty
ascetic who does what is hard to do: he eats his food when it is
thrown to the ground. He has long taken up and practised that
dog-duty. What will be his destination? What will be his future
course?"</P>
<P  >"Well,
Punna, since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say: 'Enough,
Punna, let that be. Do not ask me that,' I shall therefore answer
you.</P>
<P  >3.
"Here, Punna, someone develops the dog-duty fully and
uninterruptedly; he develops the dog-habit fully and uninterruptedly;
he develops the dog-mind fully [388] and uninterruptedly; he develops
dog-behaviour fully and uninterruptedly. Having done so, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of
dogs. But if he has such a view as this: 'By this virtue or
observance or asceticism or holy life I shall become a [great] god or
some [lesser] god,' that is wrong view in his case. Now there are
two destinations for one with wrong view, I say: hell or the animal
realm.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote601anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote601sym"><SUP>dci</SUP></A></SUP>
So, Punna, if his dog-duty succeeds, it will lead him to the company
of dogs; if it fails, it will lead him to hell."</P>
<P  >4.
When this was said, Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic cried out and
burst into tears. Then the Blessed One told Punna, son of the
Koliyans, the ox-duty ascetic: "Punna, I could not persuade you
when I said: 'Enough, Punna, let that be. Do not ask me that.""</P>
<P  >[Then
Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic said:] "Venerable sir, I am not
crying because the Blessed One has said this about me, but because I
have long taken up and practised this dog-duty. Venerable sir, this
Punna, son of the Koliyans, is an ox-duty ascetic. He has long taken
up and practised that ox-duty. What will be his destination? What
will be his future course?"</P>
<P  >"Enough,
Seniya, let that be. Do not ask me that."</P>
<P  >A
second time ... And a third time Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic
asked the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, this Punna, son of the
Koliyans, is an ox-duty ascetic. He has long taken up and practised
that ox-duty. What will be his destination? What will be his future
course?"</P>
<P  >"Well,
Seniya, since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say: 'Enough,
Seniya, let that be. Do not ask me that,' I shall therefore answer
you.</P>
<P  >5.
"Here, Seniya, someone develops the ox-duty fully and
uninterruptedly; he develops the ox-habit fully and uninterruptedly;
he develops the ox-mind fully and uninterruptedly; he develops
ox-behaviour fully and uninterruptedly. Having done so, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of
oxen. [389] But if he has such a view as this: 'By this virtue or
observance or asceticism or holy life I shall become a [great] god or
some [lesser] god,' that is wrong view in his case. Now there are
two destinations for one with wrong view, I say: hell or the animal
realm. So, Seniya, if his ox-duty succeeds, it will lead him to the
company of oxen; if it fails, it will lead him to hell."</P>
<P  >6.
When this was said, Punna, son of the Koliyans, the ox-duty ascetic
cried out and burst into tears. Then the Blessed One told Seniya the
naked dog-duty ascetic: "Seniya, I could not persuade you when I
said: 'Enough, Seniya, let that be. Do not ask me that.'"</P>
<P  >[Then
Purina the ox-duty ascetic said:] "Venerable sir, I am not crying
because the Blessed One has said this about me, but because I have
long taken up and practised this ox-duty. Venerable sir, I have
confidence in the Blessed One thus: 'The Blessed One is capable of
teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can abandon this ox-duty
and that this Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic can abandon that
dog-duty.'"</P>
<P  >"Then,
Punna, listen and attend closely to what I shall say." - "Yes,
venerable sir," he replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >7.
"Punna, there are four kinds of action proclaimed by me after
realising them for myself with direct knowledge. What are the four?
There is dark action with dark result; there is bright action with
bright result; there is dark-and-bright action with dark-and-bright
result; and there is action that is neither dark nor bright with
neither-dark-nor-bright result, action that leads to the destruction
of action.</P>
<P  >8.
"And what, Punna, is dark action with dark result? Here someone
generates an afflictive bodily formation, an afflictive verbal
formation, an afflictive mental formation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote602anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote602sym"><SUP>dcii</SUP></A></SUP>
Having generated an afflictive bodily formation, an afflictive verbal
formation, an afflictive mental formation, he reappears in an
afflictive world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote603anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote603sym"><SUP>dciii</SUP></A></SUP>
When he has reappeared in an afflictive world, afflictive contacts
touch him. Being touched by afflictive contacts, he feels afflictive
feelings, extremely painful, as in the case of the beings in [390]
hell. Thus a being's reappearance is due to a being:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote604anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote604sym"><SUP>dciv</SUP></A></SUP>
one reappears through the actions one has performed. When one has
reappeared, contacts touch one. Thus I say beings are the heirs of
their actions. This is called dark action with dark result.</P>
<P  >9.
"And what, Punna, is bright action with bright result? Here someone
generates an unafflictive bodily formation, an unafflictive verbal
formation, an unafflictive mental formation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote605anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote605sym"><SUP>dcv</SUP></A></SUP>
Having generated an unafflictive bodily formation, an unafflictive
verbal formation, an unafflictive mental formation, he reappears in
an unafflictive world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote606anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote606sym"><SUP>dcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
When he has reappeared in an unafflictive world, unafflictive
contacts touch him. Being touched by unafflictive contacts, he feels
unafflictive feelings, extremely pleasant, as in the case of the gods
of Refulgent Glory. Thus a being's reappearance is due to a being;
one reappears through the actions one has performed. When one has
reappeared, contacts touch one. Thus I say beings are the heirs of
their actions. This is called bright action with bright result.</P>
<P  >10.
"And what, Punna, is dark-and-bright action with darkand-bright
result? Here someone generates a bodily formation that is both
afflictive and unafflictive, a verbal formation that is both
afflictive and unafflictive, a mental formation that is both
afflictive and unafflictive.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote607anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote607sym"><SUP>dcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Having generated a bodily formation, a verbal formation, a mental
formation that is both afflictive and unafflictive, he reappears in a
world that is both afflictive and unafflictive. When he has
reappeared in a world that is both afflictive and unafflictive, both
afflictive and unafflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by both
afflictive and unafflictive contacts, he feels both afflictive and
unafflictive feelings, mingled pleasure and pain, as in the case of
human beings and some gods and some beings in the lower worlds. Thus
a being's reappearance is due to a being: one reappears through the
actions one has performed. When one has reappeared, contacts touch
one. Thus I say beings are the heirs to their actions. This is called
dark-and-bright action with dark-and-bright result. [391]</P>
<P  >11.
"And what, Punna, is action that is neither dark nor bright with
neither-dark-nor-bright result, action that leads to the destruction
of action? Therein, the volition in abandoning the kind of action
that is dark with dark result, and the volition in abandoning the
kind of action that is bright with bright result, and the volition in
abandoning the kind of action that is dark and bright with
dark-and-bright result: this is called action that is neither dark
nor bright with neither-dark-nor-bright result, action that leads to
the destruction of action.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote608anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote608sym"><SUP>dcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
These are the four kinds of action proclaimed by me after realising
them for myself with direct knowledge."</P>
<P  >12.
When this was said, Punna, son of the Koliyans, the oxduty ascetic
said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent,
venerable sir! The Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways
... From today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who
has gone to him for refuge for life."</P>
<P  >13.
But Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic said to the Blessed One:
"Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! The
Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to the Blessed One for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would
receive the going forth under the Blessed One, I would receive the
full admission."</P>
<P  >14.
"Seniya, one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires the
going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline
lives on probation for four months.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote609anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote609sym"><SUP>dcix</SUP></A></SUP>
At the end of four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him,
they give him the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus'
state. But I recognise individual differences in this matter."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote610anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote610sym"><SUP>dcx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the
going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live
on probation for four months, and if at the end of the four months
the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus' state, then I will live on
probation for four years. At the end of the four years if the
bhikkhus are satisfied with me, let them give me the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus' state."</P>
<P  >15.
Then Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic received the going forth under
the Blessed One, and he received the full admission. And soon, not
long after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn, [392]
diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Seniya, by realising
for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and
abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which
clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. He
directly knew: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived,
what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any
state of being." And the venerable Seniya became one of the
arahants.</P>
