147. Cularahulovada Sutta - The Shorter Discourse of Advice to Rahula</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1323anc" HREF="#sdendnote1323sym"><SUP>mcccxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Then, while the Blessed One was alone in meditation, a thought arose
in his mind thus: "The states that ripen in deliverance have
ripened in Rahula.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1324anc" HREF="#sdendnote1324sym"><SUP>mcccxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Suppose I were to lead him on further to the destruction of the
taints."</P>
<P  >Then,
when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and
outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When he had walked for alms
in Savatthi and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he
addressed the venerable Rahula thus:</P>
<P  >"Take
your sitting cloth with you, Rahula; let us go to the Blind Men's
Grove [278] to pass the day."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," the venerable Rahula replied, and taking his
sitting cloth with him, he followed close behind the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >Now
on that occasion many thousands of deities followed the Blessed One,
thinking: "Today the Blessed One will lead the venerable Rahula
further to the destruction of the taints."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1325anc" HREF="#sdendnote1325sym"><SUP>mcccxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the Blessed One went into the Blind Men's Grove and sat down
at the root of a certain tree on a seat made ready. And the venerable
Rahula paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side. The
Blessed One then said to the venerable Rahula:</P>
<P  >3.
"Rahula, what do you think? Is the eye permanent or impermanent?"
- "Impermanent, venerable sir." - "Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable sir." - "Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?" -
"No, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"Rahula,
what do you think? Are forms … Is eye-consciousness … [279] …
Is eye-contact … Are any feeling, any perception, any formations,
any consciousness that arise with eye-contact as condition permanent
or impermanent?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1326anc" HREF="#sdendnote1326sym"><SUP>mcccxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
- "Impermanent, venerable sir." - "Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable sir." - "Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?" -
"No, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >4-8.
"Rahula, what do you think? Is the ear permanent or impermanent? …
Is the nose permanent or impermanent? … Is the tongue permanent or
impermanent? … Is the body permanent or impermanent?.. .Are
mind-objects … Is mind-consciousness … Is mind-contact … Are
any feeling, any perception, any formations, any consciousness that
arise with mind-contact as condition permanent or impermanent?" -
"Impermanent, venerable sir." - "Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable sir." - "Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?" -
"No, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >9.
"Seeing thus, Rahula, a well-taught noble disciple becomes
disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with
eye-consciousness, disenchanted with eye-contact, and disenchanted
with any feeling, any perception, any formations, any consciousness
that arise with eye-contact as condition.</P>
<P  >"He
becomes disenchanted with the ear … He becomes disenchanted with
the nose … He becomes disenchanted with the tongue … He becomes
disenchanted with the body … He becomes disenchanted with the mind,
disenchanted with mind-objects, disenchanted. with
mind-consciousness, disenchanted with mindcontact, [280] and
disenchanted with any feeling, any perception, any formations, any
consciousness that arise with mind-contact as condition.</P>
<P  >10.
"Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion
[his mind] is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the
knowledge: 'It is liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is
destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been
done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'"</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Rahula was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words. Now while this discourse was
being spoken, through not clinging the venerable Rahula's mind was
liberated from the taints. And in those many thousands of deities
there arose the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma: "All that
is subject to arising is subject to cessation."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1327anc" HREF="#sdendnote1327sym"><SUP>mcccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
