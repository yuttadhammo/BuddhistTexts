41. Saleyyaka Sutta - The Brahmins of Sala</H2>
<P  >[285]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering
by stages in the Kosalan Country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and
eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahmin village named Sala.</P>
<P  >2.
The brahmin householders of Sala heard: "The recluse Gotama, the
son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been
wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and
has come to Sala. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread
to this effect: 'That Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with
its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this generation with its
recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, which he has
himself realised with direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma good in
the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the
right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is
utterly perfect and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants."</P>
<P  >3.
Then the brahmin householders of Sala went to the Blessed One. Some
paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their hands in
reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one
side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's
presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at
one side.</P>
<P  >4.
When they were seated, they said to the Blessed One: "Master
Gotama, what is the cause and condition why some beings here, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in states of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell?
And what is the cause and condition why some beings here, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world?"</P>
<P  >5.
"Householders, it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with
the Dhamma, by reason of unrighteous conduct that some beings here,
on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in states of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.
It is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, by reason
of righteous conduct that some beings here, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, reappear in a happy destination, even in the
heavenly world." [286]</P>
<P  >6.
"We do not understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's
utterance, which he has spoken in brief without expounding the
detailed meaning. It would be good if Master Gotama would teach us
the Dhamma so that we might understand the detailed meaning of his
utterance."</P>
<P  >"Then,
householders, listen and attend closely to what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >7.
"Householders, there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in
accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct. There are four kinds
of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous
conduct. There are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance
with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.</P>
<P  >8.
"And how, householders, are there three kinds of bodily conduct not
in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone
kills living beings; he is murderous, bloodyhanded, given to blows
and violence, merciless to living beings. He takes what is not given;
he takes by way of theft the wealth and property of others in the
village or forest. He misconducts himself in sensual pleasures; he
has intercourse with women who are protected by their mother, father,
mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives, who have a husband,
who are protected by law, and even with those who are garlanded in
token of betrothal. That is how there are three kinds of bodily
conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.</P>
<P  >9.
"And how, householders, are there four kinds of verbal conduct not
in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone
speaks falsehood; when summoned to a court, or to a meeting, or to
his relatives' presence, or to his guild, or to the royal family's
presence, and questioned as a witness thus: 'So, good man, tell
what you know,' not knowing, he says, 'I know,' or knowing, he
says, 'I do not know'; not seeing, he says, 'I see,' or
seeing, he says, 'I do not see'; in full awareness he speaks
falsehood for his own ends, or for another's ends, or for some
trifling worldly end. He speaks maliciously; he repeats elsewhere
what he has heard here in order to divide [those people] from these,
or he repeats to these people what he has heard elsewhere in order to
divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who divides those
who are united, a creator of divisions, who enjoys discord, rejoices
in discord, delights in discord, a speaker of words that create
discord. He speaks harshly; he utters such words as are rough, hard.,
hurtful to others, offensive to others, bordering on anger,
unconducive to concentration. [287] He is a gossip; he speaks at the
wrong time, speaks what is not fact, speaks what is useless, speaks
contrary to the Dhamma and the Discipline; at the wrong time he
speaks such words as are worthless, unreasonable, immoderate, and
unbeneficial. That is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct not
in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.</P>
<P  >10.
"And how, householders, are there three kinds of mental conduct not
in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone is
covetous; he covets the wealth and property of others thus: 'Oh,
may what belongs to another be mine!' Or he has a mind of ill will
and intentions of hate thus: 'May these beings be slain and
slaughtered, may they be cut off, perish, or be annihilated!' Or he
has wrong view, distorted vision, thus: 'There is nothing given,
nothing offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and
bad actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no
beings who are reborn spontaneously; no good and virtuous recluses
and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct
knowledge and declare this world and the other world.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote425anc" HREF="#sdendnote425sym"><SUP>cdxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how there are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance
with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct. So, householders, it is by
reason of such conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, by reason
of such unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution
of the body, after death, reappear in states of deprivation, in an
unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.</P>
<P  >11.
"Householders, there are three kinds of bodily conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct. There are four kinds
of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct.
There are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct.</P>
<P  >12.
"And how, householders, are there three kinds of bodily conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone,
abandoning the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living
beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gentle and kindly, he abides
compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is
not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; he does not
take by way of theft the wealth and property of others in the village
or in the forest. Abandoning misconduct in sensual pleasures, he
abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasures; he does not have
intercourse with women who are protected by their mother, father,
mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives, who have a husband,
who are protected by law, or with those who are garlanded in token of
betrothal. That is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct. [288]</P>
<P  >13.
"And how, householders, are there four kinds of verbal conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone,
abandoning false speech, abstains from false speech; when summoned to
a court, or to a meeting, or to his relatives' presence, or to his
guild, or to the royal family's presence, and questioned as a
witness thus: 'So, good man, tell what you know,' not knowing, he
says, 'I do not know,' or knowing, he says, 'I know'; not
seeing, he says, 'I do not see,' or seeing, he says, 'I see';
he does not in full awareness speak falsehood for his own ends, or
for another's ends, or for some trifling worldly end. Abandoning
malicious speech, he abstains from malicious speech; he does not
repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those
people] from these, nor does he repeat to these people what he has
heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people] from those; thus he
is one who reunites those who are divided, a promoter of friendships,
who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord, delights in concord, a
speaker of words that promote concord. Abandoning harsh speech, he
abstains from harsh speech; he speaks such words as are gentle,
pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to the heart, are courteous,
desired by many, and agreeable to many. Abandoning gossip, he
abstains from gossip; he speaks at the right time, speaks what is
fact, speaks on what is good, speaks on the Dhamma and the
Discipline; at the right time he speaks such words as are worth
recording, reasonable, moderate, and beneficial. That is how there
are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma,
righteous conduct.</P>
<P  >14.
"And how, householders, are there three kinds of mental conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone is not
covetous; he does not covet the wealth and property of others thus:
'Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!' His mind is without
ill will and he has intentions free from hate thus: 'May these
beings be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety! May they live
happily!' He has right view, undistorted vision, thus: 'There is
what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed; there is
fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world and the
other world; there is mother and father; there are beings who are
reborn spontaneously; there are good and virtuous recluses and
brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct
knowledge and declare this world and the other world.' That is how
there are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct. So, householders, it is by reason of such
conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, by reason of such righteous
conduct that some beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after
death, reappear in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world.

"If, householders, one who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that on the
dissolution of the body, after death, I might reappear in the company
of well-to-do nobles!' it is possible that, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, he will reappear in the company of well-to-do
nobles. Why is that? Because he observes conduct that is in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct.</P>
<P  >16-17.
"If, householders, one who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that on the
dissolution of the body, after death, I might reappear in the company
of well-to-do brahmins! … in the company of well-to-do
householders!' it is possible that, on the dissolution of the body,
after death, he will reappear in the company of</P>
<P  >well-to-do
householders. Why is that? Because he observes conduct that is in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct.</P>
<P  >18-42.
"If, householders, one who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that on the
dissolution of the body, after death, I might reappear in the company
of the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings! … in the company
of the gods of the heaven of the Thirtythree … the Yama gods …
the gods of the Tusita heaven … the gods who delight in creating …
the gods who wield power over others' creations … the gods of
Brahma's retinue … the gods of Radiance<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote426anc" HREF="#sdendnote426sym"><SUP>cdxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
… the gods of Limited Radiance … the gods of Immeasurable
Radiance … the gods of Streaming Radiance … the gods of Glory …

gods of Refulgent Glory … the gods of Great Fruit … the Aviha
gods … the Atappa gods … the Sudassa gods … the Sudassi gods …
the Akanittha gods … the gods of the base of infinite space … the
gods of the base of infinite consciousness … the gods of the base
of nothingness … the gods of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception!' it is possible that on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he will reappear in the company
of the gods of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Why is that?
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous
conduct.</P>
<P  >43.
"If, householders, one who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that by realising for
myself with direct knowledge I might here and now enter upon and
abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are
taintless with the destruction of the taints!' it is possible that,
by realising for himself with direct knowledge, he will here and now
enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by
wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints. Why is
that? Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma,
righteous conduct."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote427anc" HREF="#sdendnote427sym"><SUP>cdxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>

When this was said, the brahmin householders of Sala said to the
Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master
Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as
though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a
lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms. We go to
Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama accept us as lay followers who
have gone to him for refuge for life."</P>
