79. Culasakuludayi Sutta - The Shorter Discourse to Sakuludayin</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now on that
occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was staying in the Peacocks'
Sanctuary, the wanderers' park, with a large assembly of wanderers.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went to Rajagaha for alms. Then he thought: "It
is still too early to wander for alms in Rajagaha. Suppose I went to
the wanderer Sakuludayin in the Peacocks' Sanctuary, the wanderers'
park."</P>
<P  >3-4.
Then the Blessed One went to the Peacocks' Sanctuary, the
wanderers' park. Now on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was
seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar …
(as Sutta 77, §§4-5) [30] … For what discussion are you sitting
together here now, Udayin? And what was your discussion that was
interrupted?"</P>
<P  >5.
"Venerable sir, let be the discussion for which we are now sitting
together here. The Blessed One can well hear about it later.
Venerable sir, when I do not come to this assembly, then it sits
talking many kinds of pointless talk. But when I have come to this
assembly, then it sits looking up to me, thinking: 'Let us hear the
Dhamma that the recluse Udayin expounds.' However, when [31] the
Blessed One comes, then both I and this assembly sit looking up to
the Blessed One, thinking: 'Let us hear the Dhamma that the Blessed
One expounds.'"</P>
<P  >6.
"Then, Udayin, suggest something that I should speak about."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, in recent days there was one claiming to be omniscient and
all-seeing, to have complete knowledge and vision thus: 'Whether I
am walking or standing or sleeping or awake, knowledge and vision are
continuously and uninterruptedly present to me.' When I asked him a
question about the past, he prevaricated, led the talk aside, and
showed anger, hate, and bitterness. Then I remembered the Blessed One
thus: 'Ah, surely it is the Blessed One, surely it is the Sublime
One who is skilled in these things.'"</P>
<P  >"But,
Udayin, who was it that claimed to be omniscient and all-seeing …
yet when asked a question by you about the past, prevaricated, led
the talk aside, and showed anger, hate, and bitterness?"</P>
<P  >"It
was the Nigantha Nataputta, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >7.
"Udayin, if someone should recollect his manifold past lives, that
is, one birth, two births … thus, with their aspects and
particulars, should he recollect his manifold past lives, then either
he might ask me a question about the past or I might ask him a
question about the past, and he might satisfy my mind with his answer
to my question or I might satisfy his mind with my answer to his
question. If someone with the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, should see beings passing away and reappearing,
inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate …
and understand how beings pass on according to their actions, then
either he might ask me a question about the future [32] or I might
ask him a question about the future, and he might satisfy my mind
with his answer to my question or I might satisfy his mind with my
answer to his question. But let be the past, Udayin, let be the
future. I shall teach you the Dhamma: When this exists, that comes to
be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist,
that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote782anc" HREF="#sdendnote782sym"><SUP>dcclxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
"Venerable sir, I cannot even recollect with their aspects and
particulars all that I have experienced within this present
existence, so how should I recollect my manifold past lives, that is,
one birth, two births … with their aspects and particulars, as the
Blessed One does? And I cannot now even see a mud-goblin, so how
should I with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the
human, see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and
superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate … and understand
how beings pass on according to their actions, as the Blessed One
does? But, venerable sir, when the Blessed One told me: 'But let be
the past, Udayin, let be the future. I shall teach you the Dhamma:
When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that
arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the
cessation of this, that ceases' - that is even more unclear to me.
Perhaps, venerable sir, I might satisfy the Blessed One's mind by
answering a question about our own teachers' doctrine."</P>
<P  >9.
"Well, Udayin, what is taught in your own teachers' doctrine?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, it is taught that in our own teachers' doctrine: 'This is
the perfect splendour, this is the perfect splendour!'"</P>
<P  >"But,
Udayin, since it is taught in your own teachers' doctrine: 'This
is the perfect splendour, this is the perfect splendour!' - what is
that perfect splendour?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by
any other splendour higher or more sublime."</P>
<P  >"But,
Udayin, what is that splendour which is unsurpassed by any other
splendour higher or more sublime?" [33]</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by
any other splendour higher or more sublime."</P>
<P  >10.
Udayin, you might continue for a long time in this way. You say:
'Venerable sir, that splendour is the perfect splendour which is
unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime,' yet you
do not indicate what that splendour is. Suppose a man were to say: 'I
am in love with the most beautiful girl in this country.' Then they
would ask him: 'Good man, that most beautiful girl in this country
with whom you are in love - do you know whether she is from the noble
class or the brahmin class or the merchant class or the worker
class?' and he would reply: 'No.' Then they would ask him:
'Good man, that most beautiful girl in this country with whom you
are in love - do you know her name and clan?.. .Whether she is tall
or short or of middle height? … Whether she is dark or brown or
goldenskinned? … What village or town or city she lives in?' and
he would reply: 'No.' And then they would ask him: 'Good man,
do you then love a girl you have never known or seen?' and he would
reply: 'Yes.' What do you think, Udayin, that being so, would not
that man's talk amount to nonsense?"</P>
<P  >"Surely,
venerable sir, that being so, that man's talk would amount to
nonsense."</P>
<P  >"But
in the same way, Udayin, you say thus: 'That splendour is the
perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher
or more sublime,' yet you do not indicate what that splendour is."</P>
<P  >11.
"Venerable sir, just as a beautiful beryl gem of purest water,
eight-faceted, well cut, lying on red brocade, glows, radiates, and
shines, of such splendour is the self [surviving] unimpaired after
death."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote783anc" HREF="#sdendnote783sym"><SUP>dcclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
"What do you think, Udayin? This beautiful beryl gem of purest
water, eight-faceted, well cut, lying on red brocade, [34] which
glows, radiates, and shines, or a glowworm in the thick darkness of
the night - of these two, which gives off the splendour that is more
excellent and sublime?" - "The glowworm in the thick darkness of
the night, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >13.
"What do you think, Udayin? This glowworm in the thick darkness of
the night or an oil-lamp in the thick darkness of the night - of
these two, which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and
sublime?" - "The oil-lamp, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >14.
"What do you think, Udayin? This oil-lamp in the thick darkness of
the night or a great bonfire in the thick darkness of the night - of
these two, which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and
sublime?" - "The great bonfire, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >15.
"What do you think, Udayin? This great bonfire in the thick
darkness of the night or the morning star towards dawn in a clear
cloudless sky - of these two, which gives off the splendour that is
more excellent and sublime?" - "The morning star towards dawn in
a clear cloudless sky, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >16.
"What do you think, Udayin? The morning star towards dawn in a
clear cloudless sky or the full moon at midnight in a clear cloudless
sky on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth - of these two, which gives
off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime?" - "The
full moon at midnight in a clear cloudless sky on the Uposatha day of
the fifteenth, venerable sir." [35]</P>
<P  >17.
"What do you think, Udayin? The full moon at midnight in a clear
cloudless sky on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, or the full disk
of the sun at midday in a clear cloudless sky in autumn in the last
month of the rainy season - of these two, which gives off the
splendour that is more excellent and sublime?" - "The full disk
of the sun at midday in a clear cloudless sky in autumn in the last
month of the rainy season, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >18.
"Beyond this, Udayin, I know of very many gods [whose splendour]
the radiance of the sun and moon does not match, yet I do not say
that there is no other splendour higher or more sublime than that
splendour. But you, Udayin, say of that splendour which is lower and
meaner than a glowworm's: 'This is the perfect splendour,' yet
you do not indicate what that splendour is."</P>
<P  >19.
"The Blessed One has terminated the discussion; the Sublime One has
terminated the discussion."</P>
<P  >"But,
Udayin, why do you say that?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, it is taught in our own teachers' doctrine: 'This is the
perfect splendour, this is the perfect splendour.' But on being
pressed and questioned and cross-questioned about our own teachers'
doctrine by the Blessed One, we are found empty, hollow, and
mistaken."</P>
<P  >20.
"How is it, Udayin, is there an entirely pleasant world? Is there a
practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, it is taught in our own teachers' doctrine: 'There is an
entirely pleasant world; there is a practical way to realise an
entirely pleasant world.'"</P>
<P  >21.
"But, Udayin, what is that practical way to realise an entirely
pleasant world?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
venerable sir, abandoning the killing of living beings, someone
abstains from killing living beings; abandoning the taking of what is
not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; abandoning
misconduct in sensual pleasures, he abstains from misconduct in
sensual pleasures; [36] abandoning false speech, he abstains from
false speech; or else he undertakes and practises some kind of
asceticism. This is the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant
world."</P>
<P  >22.
"What do you think, Udayin? On an occasion when he abandons the
killing of living beings and abstains from killing living beings,
does his self then feel only pleasure or both pleasure and pain?"</P>
<P  >"Both
pleasure and pain, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Udayin? On an occasion when he abandons the taking of
what is not given and abstains from taking what is not given … when
he abandons misconduct in sensual pleasures and abstains from
misconduct in sensual pleasures … when he abandons false speech and
abstains from false speech, does his self then feel only pleasure or
both pleasure and pain?"</P>
<P  >"Both
pleasure and pain, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Udayin? On an occasion when he under takes and
practises some kind of asceticism, does his self then feel only
pleasure or both pleasure and pain?"</P>
<P  >"Both
pleasure and pain, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Udayin? Does the realisation of an entirely pleasant
world come about by following a way of mixed pleasure and pain?"</P>
<P  >23.
"The Blessed One has terminated the discussion; the Sublime One has
terminated the discussion."</P>
<P  >"But,
Udayin, why do you say that?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, it is taught in our own teachers' doctrine:</P>
<P  >'There
is an entirely pleasant world; there is a practical way to realise an
entirely pleasant world.' But on being pressed and questioned and
cross-questioned about our own teachers' doctrine by the Blessed
One, we are found empty, hollow, and mistaken. But how is it,
venerable sir, is there an entirely pleasant world? Is there a
practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world?" [37]</P>
<P  >24.
"There is an entirely pleasant world, Udayin; there is a practical
way to realise an entirely pleasant world."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, what is that practical way to realise an entirely pleasant
world?"</P>
<P  >25.
"Here, Udayin, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana … With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he
enters upon and abides in the second jhana … in the third jhana …
This is the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, that is not the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant
world; at that point an entirely pleasant world has already been
realised."</P>
<P  >"Udayin,
at that point an entirely pleasant world has not yet been realised;
that is only the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant
world."</P>
<P  >26.
When this was said, the wanderer Sakuludayin's assembly made an
uproar, saying very loudly and noisily: "We are lost along with our
own teachers' doctrines! We are lost along with our own teachers'
doctrines! We know nothing higher than that!"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote784anc" HREF="#sdendnote784sym"><SUP>dcclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Then
the wanderer Sakuludayin quieted those wanderers and asked the
Blessed One:</P>
<P  >27.
"Venerable sir, at what point is an entirely pleasant world
realised?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
Udayin, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana, which has neitherpain-nor-pleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. He dwells with those deities
who have arisen in an entirely pleasant world and he talks with them
and enters into conversation with them.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote785anc" HREF="#sdendnote785sym"><SUP>dcclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
It is at this point that an entirely pleasant world has been
realised."</P>
<P  >28.
"Venerable sir, surely it is for the sake of realising that
entirely pleasant world that bhikkhus lead the holy life under the
Blessed One."</P>
<P  >"It
is not for the sake of realising that entirely pleasant world that
bhikkhus lead the holy life under me. There are other states, Udayin,
higher and more sublime [than that] and it is for the sake of
realising them that bhikkhus lead the holy life under me." [38]</P>
<P  >"What
are those higher and more sublime states, venerable sir, for the sake
of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under the Blessed
One?"</P>
<P  >29-36.
"Here, Udayin, a Tathagata appears in the world, accomplished,
fully enlightened … (as Sutta 51, §§12-19) … he purifies his
mind from doubt.</P>
<P  >37.
"Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in
the first jhana … This, Udayin, is a higher and more sublime state
for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me.</P>
<P  >38-40.
"Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana … the third
jhana … the fourth jhana. This too, Udayin, is a higher and more
sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy
life under me.</P>
<P  >41.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one
birth, two births … (as Sutta 51, §24) … Thus with their</P>
<P  >aspects
and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. This too,
Udayin, is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising
which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me.</P>
<P  >42.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 51, §25) … Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions. This too, Udayin, is a higher and more
sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy
life under me.</P>
<P  >43.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. He understands as it actually is : 'This is suffering'
… (as Sutta 51, §26) [39] … He understands as it actually is:
'This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.'</P>
<P  >44.
"When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'It is
liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.' This too, Udayin, is a higher and
more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the
holy life under me.</P>
<P  >"These,
Udayin, are those higher and more sublime states for the sake of
realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me."</P>
<P  >45.
When this was said, the wanderer Sakuludayin said to the Blessed One:
"Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! The
Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to the Blessed One for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would
receive the going forth under the Blessed One, venerable sir, I would
receive the full admission."</P>
<P  >46.
When this was said, the wanderer Sakuludayiri s assembly</P>
<P  >addressed
him thus: "Do not lead the holy life under the recluse Gotama,
Master Udayin. Having been a teacher, Master Udayin, do not live as a
pupil. For Master Udayin to do so would be as if a water jug were to
become a pitcher. Do not lead the holy life under the recluse Gotama,
Master Udayin. Having been a teacher, Master Udayin, do not live as a
pupil."</P>
<P  >That
is how the wanderer Sakuludayiri s assembly obstructed him from
leading the holy life under the Blessed One.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote786anc" HREF="#sdendnote786sym"><SUP>dcclxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
