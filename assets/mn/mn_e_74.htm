74. Dighanakha Sutta - To Dighanakha</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Boar's Cave on the mountain Vulture Peak.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the wanderer Dighanakha went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote730anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote730sym"><SUP>dccxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one
side and said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, my doctrine and
view is this: 'Nothing is acceptable to me."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote731anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote731sym"><SUP>dccxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"This
view of yours, Aggivessana, 'Nothing is acceptable to me' - is
not at least that view acceptable to you?"</P>
<P  >"If
this view of mine were acceptable to me, Master Gotama, it too would
be the same, it too [498] would be the same."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote732anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote732sym"><SUP>dccxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
"Well, Aggivessana, there are plenty in the world who say: 'It
too would be the same, it too would be the same,' yet they do not
abandon that view and they take up still some other view. Those are
few in the world who say: 'It too would be the same, it too would
be the same,' and who abandon that view and do not take up some
other view.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote733anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote733sym"><SUP>dccxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
"Aggivessana, there are some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine
and view is this: 'Everything is acceptable to me.' There are
some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: 'Nothing
is acceptable to me.' And there are some recluses and brahmins
whose doctrine and view is this: 'Something is acceptable to me,
something is not acceptable to me.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote734anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote734sym"><SUP>dccxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Among these, the view of those recluses and brahmins who hold the
doctrine and view 'Everything is acceptable to me' is close to
lust, close to bondage, close to delighting, close to holding, close
to clinging. The view of those recluses and brahmins who hold the
doctrine and view 'Nothing is acceptable to me' is close to
non-lust, close to non-bondage, close to non-delighting, close to
non-holding, close to non-clinging."</P>
<P  >5.
When this was said, the wanderer Dighanakha remarked: "Master
Gotama commends my point of view, Master Gotama recommends my point
of view."</P>
<P  >"Aggivessana,
as to those recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine and view
'Something is acceptable to me, something is not acceptable to me'
- the view of theirs as to what is acceptable is close to lust, close
to bondage, close to delighting, close to holding, close to clinging,
while the view of theirs as to what is not acceptable is close to
non-lust, close to non-bondage, close to non-delighting, close to
non-holding, close to non-clinging.</P>
<P  >6.
"Now, Aggivessana, a wise man among those recluses and brahmins who
hold the doctrine and view 'Everything is acceptable to me'
considers thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote735anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote735sym"><SUP>dccxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
'If I obstinately adhere to my view "Everything is acceptable to
me" and declare: "Only this is true, anything else is wrong,"
then I may clash with the two others: with a recluse or brahmin who
holds the doctrine [499] and view "Nothing is acceptable to me"
and with a recluse or brahmin who holds the doctrine and view
"Something is acceptable to me, something is not acceptable to me."
I may clash with these two, and when there is a clash, there are
disputes; when there are disputes, there are quarrels; when there are
quarrels, there is vexation.' Foreseeing for himself clashes,
disputes, quarrels, and vexation, he abandons that view and does not
take up some other view. This is how there comes to be the abandoning
of these views; this is how there comes to be the relinquishing of
these views.</P>

"Now, Aggivessana,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote736anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote736sym"><SUP>dccxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
this body made of material form, consisting of the four great
elements, procreated by a mother and father, and built up out of
boiled rice and porridge, is subject to impermanence, to being worn
and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration. It should be
regarded as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a tumour, as
a dart, as a calamity, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating,
as void, as not self. When one regards this body thus, one abandons
desire for the body, affection for the body, subservience to the
body.</P>
<P  >10.
"There are, Aggivessana, three kinds of feeling: pleasant feeling,
painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. On the
occasion when one feels pleasant feeling, one does not feel painful
feeling or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling; on that occasion one
feels only pleasant feeling. On the occasion when one feels painful
feeling, one does not feel pleasant feeling or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling; on that occasion one feels only
painful feeling. On the occasion when one feels
neitherpainful-nor-pleasant feeling, one does not feel pleasant
feeling or painful feeling; on that occasion one feels only
neitherpainful-nor-pleasant feeling.</P>
<P  >11.
"Pleasant feeling, Aggivessana, is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away,
and ceasing. Painful feeling too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away,
and ceasing. Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling too is impermanent,
conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanishing,
fading away, and ceasing.</P>
<P  >12.
"Seeing thus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes disenchanted
with pleasant feeling, disenchanted with painful feeling,
disenchanted with neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Being
disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion [his mind]
is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'It
is liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.'</P>
<P  >13.
"A bhikkhu whose mind is liberated thus, Aggivessana, sides with
none and disputes with none; he employs the speech currently used in
the world without adhering to it."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote737anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote737sym"><SUP>dccxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was standing behind the
Blessed One, [501] fanning him. Then he thought: "The Blessed One,
indeed, speaks of the abandoning of these things through direct
knowledge; the Sublime One, indeed, speaks of the relinquishing of
these things through direct knowledge." As the venerable Sariputta
considered this, through not clinging his mind was liberated from the
taints.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote738anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote738sym"><SUP>dccxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
But in the wanderer Dighanakha the spotless immaculate vision of the
Dhamma arose: "All that is subject to arising is subject to
cessation." The wanderer Dighanakha saw the Dhamma, attained the
Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma; he crossed beyond
doubt, did away with perplexity, gained intrepidity, and became
independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote739anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote739sym"><SUP>dccxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >16.
Then he said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama!
Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear
in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been
overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was
lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see
forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the
Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay
follower who has gone to him for refuge for life."</P>
