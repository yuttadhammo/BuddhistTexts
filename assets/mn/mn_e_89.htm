89. Dhammacetiya Sutta - Monuments to the Dhamma</H2>
<P  >[118]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named Medalumpa.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Nagaraka
for some business or other. Then he addressed Digha Karayana:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote835anc" HREF="#sdendnote835sym"><SUP>dcccxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
“Dear Karayana, have the state carriages prepared. Let us go to the
pleasure garden to see a pleasing spot.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sire,” Digha Karayana replied. When the state carriages were
prepared, he informed the king: “Sire, the state carriages are
ready for you. Now is the time to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then King Pasenadi mounted a state carriage, and accompanied by the
other carriages, he drove out from Nagaraka with the full pomp of
royalty and proceeded towards the park. He went thus as far as the
road was passable for carriages and then dismounted from his carriage
and entered the park on foot.</P>
<P  >4.
As he walked and wandered in the park for exercise, King Pasenadi saw
roots of trees that were lovely and inspiring, quiet and undisturbed
by voices, with an atmosphere of seclusion, remote from people,
favourable for retreat. The sight of these reminded him of the
Blessed One thus: “These roots of trees are lovely and inspiring,
quiet and undisturbed by voices, with an atmosphere of seclusion,
remote from people, favourable for retreat, like the places where we
used to pay respect to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened.” Then he told Digha Karayana what he had thought and
asked: “Where is he living now, [119] the Blessed One, accomplished
and fully enlightened?”</P>
<P  >5.
“There is, sire, a town of the Sakyans named Medalumpa. The Blessed
One, accomplished and fully enlightened, is now living there.”</P>
<P  >“How
far is it from Nagaraka to Medalumpa?”</P>
<P  >“It
is not far, sire, three leagues.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote836anc" HREF="#sdendnote836sym"><SUP>dcccxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
There is still daylight enough to go there.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
dear Karayana, have the state carriages prepared. Let us go and see
the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sire,” he replied. When the state carriages were prepared, he
informed the king: “Sire, the state carriages are ready for you.
Now is the time to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then King Pasenadi mounted a state carriage, and accompanied by the
other carriages, set out from Nagaraka towards the Sakyan town of
Medalumpa. He arrived there while it was still daylight and proceeded
towards the park. He went thus as far as the road was passable for
carriages, and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the
park on foot.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in
the open. Then King Pasenadi went to them and asked: “Venerable
sirs, where is he living now, the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened? We want to see the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened.”</P>
<P  >8.
“That is his dwelling, great king, with the closed door. Go up to
it quietly, without hurrying, enter the porch, clear your throat, and
tap on the panel. The Blessed One will open the door for you.” King
Pasenadi handed over his sword and turban to Digha Karayana then and
there. Then Digha Karayana thought: “So the king is going into
secret session now! And I have to wait here alone now!”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote837anc" HREF="#sdendnote837sym"><SUP>dcccxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Without hurrying, King Pasenadi went quietly up to the dwelling with
the closed door, entered the porch, cleared his throat, and tapped on
the panel. The Blessed One opened the door.</P>
<P  >9.
Then King Pasenadi [120] entered the dwelling. Prostrating himself
with his head at the Blessed One’s feet, he covered the Blessed
One’s feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands,
pronouncing his name: “I am King Pasenadi of Kosala, venerable sir;
I am King Pasenadi of Kosala, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“But,
great king, what reason do you see for doing such supreme honour to
this body and for showing such friendship?”</P>
<P  >10.
“Venerable sir, I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One:
‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well
proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha of the Blessed One’s
disciples is practising the good way.’ Now, venerable sir, I see
some recluses and brahmins leading a limited holy life for ten years,
twenty years, thirty years, or forty years, and then on a later
occasion I see them well groomed and well anointed, with trimmed hair
and beards, enjoying themselves provided and endowed with the five
cords of sensual pleasure. But here I see bhikkhus leading the
perfect and pure holy life as long as life and breath last. Indeed, I
do not see any other holy life elsewhere as perfect and pure as this.
This is why, venerable sir, I infer according to Dhamma about the
Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is
well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha of the Blessed One’s
disciples is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >11.
“Again, venerable sir, kings quarrel with kings, nobles with
nobles, brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders;
mother quarrels with child, child with mother, father with child,
child with father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with
sister, sister with brother, friend with friend.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote838anc" HREF="#sdendnote838sym"><SUP>dcccxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
But here I see bhikkhus living in concord, with mutual appreciation,
without disputing, blending like milk and water, [121] viewing each
other with kindly eyes. I do not see any other assembly elsewhere
with such concord. This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according
to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >12.
“Again, venerable sir, I have walked and wandered from park to park
and from garden to garden. There I have seen some recluses and
brahmins who are lean, wretched, unsightly, jaundiced, with veins
standing out on their limbs, such that people would not want to look
at them again. I have thought: ‘Surely these venerable ones are
leading the holy life in discontent, or they have done some evil deed
and are concealing it, so lean and wretched are they-such that people
would not want to look at them again.’ I went up to them and asked:
‘Why are you venerable ones so lean and wretched … such that
people would not want to look at you again?’ Their reply was: ‘It
is our family sickness, great king.’ But here I see bhikkhus
smiling and cheerful, sincerely joyful, plainly delighting, their
faculties fresh, living at ease, unruffled, subsisting on what others
give, abiding with mind [as aloof] as a wild deer’s. I have
thought: ‘Surely these venerable ones perceive successive states of
lofty distinction in the Blessed One’s Dispensation, since they
abide thus smiling and cheerful … with mind [as aloof] as a wild
deer’s.’ This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according to
Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >13.
“Again, venerable sir, being a head-anointed noble king, [122] I am
able to have executed those who should be executed, to fine those who
should be fined, to exile those who should be exiled. Yet when I am
sitting in council, they break in and interrupt me. Though I say:
‘Gentlemen, do not break in and interrupt me when I am sitting in
council; wait till the end of my speech,’ still they break in and
interrupt me. But here I see bhikkhus while the Blessed One is
teaching the Dhamma<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote839anc" HREF="#sdendnote839sym"><SUP>dcccxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
to an assembly of several hundred followers and then there is not
even the sound of a disciple of the Blessed One coughing or clearing
his throat. Once the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma to an
assembly of several hundred followers and there a disciple of his
cleared his throat. Thereupon one of his companions in the holy life
nudged him with his knee to indicate: ‘Be quiet, venerable sir,
make no noise; the Blessed One, the Teacher, is teaching us the
Dhamma.’ I thought: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvellous how an
assembly can be so well disciplined without force or weapon!’
Indeed, I do not see any other assembly elsewhere so well
disciplined. This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according to
Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >14.
“Again, venerable sir, I have seen here certain learned nobles who
were clever, knowledgeable about the doctrines of others, as sharp as
hairsplitting marksmen;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote840anc" HREF="#sdendnote840sym"><SUP>dcccxl</SUP></A></SUP>
they wander about, as it were, demolishing the views of others with
their sharp wits. When they hear: ‘The recluse Gotama will visit
such and such a village or town,’ they formulate a question thus:
‘We will go to the recluse Gotama and ask him this question. If he
is asked like this, he will answer like this, and so we will refute
his doctrine in this way; and if he is asked like that, he will
answer like that, and so we will refute his doctrine in that way.’
They hear: ‘The recluse Gotama has come to visit such and such a
village or town.’ They go to the Blessed One, and the Blessed One
instructs, urges, rouses, [123] and encourages them with a talk on
the Dhamma. After they have been instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma, they do not
so much as ask him the question, so how should they refute his
doctrine? In actual fact, they become his disciples. This too,
venerable sir, is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed
One: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well
proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha of the Blessed One’s
disciples is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >15.
“Again, venerable sir, I have seen here certain learned brahmins …</P>
<P  >16.
“Again, venerable sir, I have seen here certain learned
householders …</P>
<P  >17.
“Again, venerable sir, I have seen here certain learned recluses …
They do not so much as ask him the question, so how should they
refute his doctrine? In actual fact, they ask the Blessed One to
allow them to go forth from the home life into homelessness, and he
gives them the going forth. Not long after they have thus gone forth,
dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, by
realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now
enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the
sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into
homelessness. They say thus: ‘We were very nearly lost, we very
nearly perished, for formerly we claimed that we were recluses though
we were not really recluses; we claimed that we were brahmins though
we were not really brahmins; we claimed that we were arahants though
we were not really arahants. But now we are recluses, now we are
brahmins, now we are arahants.’ This too, venerable sir, is why I
infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One
is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed
One, the Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the
good way.’</P>
<P  >18.
“Again, venerable sir, Isidatta and Purana,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote841anc" HREF="#sdendnote841sym"><SUP>dcccxli</SUP></A></SUP>
my two inspectors, eat my food and use my carriages; I provide them
with a livelihood and bring them fame. Yet in spite of this, they are
less respectful towards me [124] than they are towards the Blessed
One. Once when I had gone out leading an army and was testing these
inspectors, Isidatta and Purana, I happened to put up in very cramped
quarters. Then these two inspectors, Isidatta and Purana, after
spending much of the night in talk on the Dhamma, lay down with their
heads in the direction where they had heard that the Blessed One was
staying and with their feet towards me. I thought: ‘It is
wonderful, it is marvellous! These two inspectors, Isidatta and
Purana, eat my food and use my carriages; I provide them with a
livelihood and bring them fame. Yet in spite of this, they are less
respectful towards me than they are towards the Blessed One. Surely
these good people perceive successive states of lofty distinction in
the Blessed One’s Dispensation.’ This too, venerable sir, is why
I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One
is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed
One, the Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the
good way.’</P>
<P  >19.
“Again, venerable sir, the Blessed One is a noble and I am a noble;
the Blessed One is a Kosalan and I am a Kosalan; the Blessed One is
eighty years old and I am eighty years old.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote842anc" HREF="#sdendnote842sym"><SUP>dcccxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
Since that is so, I think it proper to do such supreme honour to the
Blessed One and to show such friendship.</P>
<P  >20.
“And now, venerable sir, we depart. We are busy and have much to
do.”</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time, great king, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >Then
King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat, and after paying homage
to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote843anc" HREF="#sdendnote843sym"><SUP>dcccxliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >21.
Then soon after he had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus: “Bhikkhus, before rising from his seat and departing, this
King Pasenadi uttered monuments to the Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote844anc" HREF="#sdendnote844sym"><SUP>dcccxliv</SUP></A></SUP>
Learn the monuments to the Dhamma, bhikkhus; master [125] the
monuments to the Dhamma; remember the monuments to the Dhamma. The
monuments to the Dhamma are beneficial, bhikkhus, and they belong to
the fundamentals of the holy life.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
