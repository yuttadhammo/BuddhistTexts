91. Brahmayu Sutta - Brahmayu</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with
five hundred bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Brahmayu was living at Mithila. He
was old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the
last stage; he was in his hundred and twentieth year. He was a master
of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and
etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and
grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks
of a Great Man.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote850anc" HREF="#sdendnote850sym"><SUP>dcccl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
The brahmin Brahmayu heard: "The recluse Gotama, the son of the
Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been wandering in the
country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with five
hundred bhikkhus. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread
to this effect: 'The Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with
its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this generation with its
recluses and brahmins, with its princes and its people, which he has
himself realised with direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma that is
good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with
the right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is
utterly perfect and pure.' Now it is good to see such arahants."
[134]</P>
<P  >4.
Now at that time the brahmin Brahmayu had a young Brahmin student
named Uttara who was a master of the Three Vedas … fully versed in
natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. He told his
student: "My dear Uttara, the recluse Gotama, the son of the
Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan</P>
<P  >clan,
has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha
of bhikkhus, with five hundred bhikkhus … Now it is good to see
such arahants. Come, my dear Uttara, go to the recluse Gotama and
find out whether the report spread about him is true or not, and
whether Master Gotama is one such as this or not. Thus we shall know
about Master Gotama through you."</P>
<P  >5.
"But how shall I find out, sir, whether the report spread about
Master Gotama is true or not, and whether Master Gotama is one such
as this or not?"</P>
<P  >"My
dear Uttara, the thirty-two marks of a Great Man have been handed
down in our hymns, and the Great Man who is endowed with them has
only two possible destinies, no other.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote851anc" HREF="#sdendnote851sym"><SUP>dcccli</SUP></A></SUP>
If he lives the home life, he becomes a Wheel-turning Monarch, a
righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, master of the four quarters,
all-victorious, who has stabilised his country and possesses the
seven treasures. He has these seven treasures: the wheel-treasure,
the elephant-treasure, the horse-treasure, the jewel-treasure, the
woman-treasure, the steward-treasure, and the counsellor-treasure as
the seventh.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote852anc" HREF="#sdendnote852sym"><SUP>dccclii</SUP></A></SUP>
His children, who exceed a thousand, are brave and heroic, and crush
the armies of others; over this earth bounded by the ocean, he rules
without a rod, without a weapon, by means of the Dhamma. But if he
goes forth from the home life into homelessness, he becomes an
Accomplished One, a Fully Enlightened One, who draws aside the veil
in the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote853anc" HREF="#sdendnote853sym"><SUP>dcccliii</SUP></A></SUP>
But I, my dear Uttara, am the giver of the hymns; you are the
receiver of them."</P>
<P  >6.
"Yes, sir," he replied. He rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to the brahmin Brahmayu, keeping him on his right, he left for
the country of the Videhans, where the Blessed One was wandering.
[135] Travelling by stages, he came to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and looked for the thirty-two marks
of a Great Man on the Blessed One's body. He saw, more or less, the
thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One's body, except
two; he was doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he
could not decide and make up his mind about them: about the male
organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the
tongue.</P>
<P  >Then
it occurred to the Blessed One: "This brahmin student Uttara sees,
more or less, the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on me, except two;
he is doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he cannot
decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being
enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue."</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the
Brahmin student Uttara saw that the Blessed One's male organ was
enclosed in a sheath.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote854anc" HREF="#sdendnote854sym"><SUP>dcccliv</SUP></A></SUP>
Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue, and he repeatedly touched
both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered the whole of his
forehead with his tongue.</P>
<P  >8.
Then the brahmin student Uttara thought: "The recluse Gotama is
endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Man. Suppose I were to
follow the recluse Gotama and observe his behaviour?"</P>
<P  >Then
he followed the Blessed One for seven months like a shadow, never
leaving him. At the end of the seven months in the country of the
Videhans, he set out to journey to Mithila where the brahmin Brahmayu
was. When he arrived, he paid homage to him and sat down at one side.
Thereupon, the brahmin Brahmayu asked him: "Well, my dear Uttara,
is the report that has been spread about Master Gotama [136] true or
not? And is Master Gotama one such as this or not?"</P>
<P  >9.
"The report that has been spread about Master Gotama is true, sir,
and not otherwise; and Master Gotama is one such as this and not
otherwise. He possesses the thirty-two marks of a Great Man.</P>
<P  >Master
Gotama sets his foot down squarely - this is a mark of a Great Man in
Master Gotama.</P>
<P  >On
the soles of his feet there are wheels with a thousand spokes and
ribs and hubs all complete …</P>
<P >
He has projecting heels …</P>
<P >
He has long fingers and toes …</P>
<P >
His hands and feet are soft and tender …</P>

He has netted hands and feet …</P>

His feet are arched …</P>
<P >
He has legs like an antelope's …</P>
<P >
When he stands without stooping, the palms of both his hands touch
and rub against his knees …</P>
<P >
His male organ is enclosed in a sheath …</P>
<P >
He is the colour of gold, his skin has a golden sheen …</P>
<P >
He is fine-skinned, and because of the fineness of his skin, dust and
dirt do not stick on his body …</P>
<P >
His body-hairs grow singly, each body-hair growing alone in a hair
socket …</P>
<P >
The tips of his body-hairs turn up; the up-turned body-hairs are
blue-black, the colour of collyrium, curled and turned to the right …</P>
<P >
He has the straight limbs of a Brahma …</P>
<P >
He has seven convexities … <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote855anc" HREF="#sdendnote855sym"><SUP>dccclv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
He has the torso of a lion …</P>
<P >
The furrow between his shoulders is filled in …</P>
<P >
He has the spread of a banyan tree; the span of his arms equals the
height of his body, and the height of his body equals</P>
<P >
the span of his arms …</P>
<P >
His neck and his shoulders are even …</P>
<P >
His taste is supremely acute … <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote856anc" HREF="#sdendnote856sym"><SUP>dccclvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
He is lion-jawed … [137]</P>

His teeth are without gaps …</P>

He has hair growing in the space between his eyebrows, which is white
with the sheen of soft cotton …</P>

<P  >Master
Gotama is endowed with these thirty-two marks of a Great Man.</P>
<P  >10.
"When he walks, he steps out with the right foot first. He does not
extend his foot too far or put it down too near. He walks neither too
quickly nor too slowly. He walks without his knees knocking together.
He walks without his ankles knocking together. He walks without
raising or lowering his thighs, or bringing them together or keeping
them apart. When he walks, only the lower part of his body
oscillates, and he does not walk with bodily effort. When he turns to
look, he does so with his whole body. He does not look straight up;
he does not look straight down. He does not walk looking about. He
looks a plough-yoke's length before him; beyond that he has
unhindered knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >11.
"When he goes indoors, he does not raise or lower his body, or bend
it forward or back. [138] He turns round neither too far from the
seat nor too near it. He does not lean on the seat with his hand. He
does not throw his body onto the seat.</P>
<P  >12.
"When seated indoors, he does not fidget with his hands. He does
not fidget with his feet. He does not sit with his knees crossed. He
does not sit with his ankles crossed. He does not sit with his hand
holding his chin. When seated indoors he is not afraid, he does not
shiver and tremble, he is not nervous. Being unafraid, not shivering
or trembling or nervous, his hair does not stand up and he is intent
on seclusion.</P>
<P  >13.
"When he receives the water for the bowl, he does not raise or
lower the bowl or tip it forwards or backwards. He receives neither
too little nor too much water for the bowl. He washes the bowl
without making a splashing noise. He washes the bowl without turning
it round. He does not put the bowl on the floor to wash his hands:
when his hands are washed, the bowl is washed; and when the bowl is
washed, his hands are washed. He pours the water for the bowl neither
too far nor too near and he does not pour it about.</P>
<P  >14.
"When he receives rice, he does not raise or lower the bowl or tip
it forwards or backwards. He receives neither too little rice nor too
much rice. He adds sauces in the right proportion; he does not exceed
the right amount of sauce in the mouthful. He turns the mouthful over
two or three times in his mouth and then swallows it, and no rice
kernel enters his body unchewed, and no rice kernel remains in his
mouth; then he takes another mouthful. He takes his food experiencing
the taste, though not experiencing greed for the taste. The food he
takes has eight factors: it is neither for amusement nor for
intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness,
but only for the endurance and continuance of his body, for the
ending of discomfort, and for assisting the holy life; [139] he
considers: 'Thus I shall terminate old feelings without arousing
new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in
comfort."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote858anc" HREF="#sdendnote858sym"><SUP>dccclviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
"When he has eaten and receives water for the bowl, he does not
raise or lower the bowl or tip it forwards or backwards.</P>
<P  >He
receives neither too little nor too much water for the bowl. He
washes the bowl without making a splashing noise. He washes the bowl
without turning it round. He does not put the bowl on the floor to
wash his hands: when his hands are washed, the bowl is washed; and
when the bowl is washed, his hands are washed. He pours the water for
the bowl neither too far nor too near and he does not pour it about.</P>
<P  >16.
"When he has eaten, he puts the bowl on the floor neither too far
nor too near; and he is neither careless of the bowl nor
over-solicitous about it.</P>
<P  >17.
"When he has eaten, he sits in silence for a while, but he does not
let the time for the blessing go by.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote859anc" HREF="#sdendnote859sym"><SUP>dccclix</SUP></A></SUP>
When he has eaten and gives the blessing, he does not do so
criticising the meal or expecting another meal; he instructs, urges,
rouses, and encourages that audience with talk purely on the Dhamma.
When he has done so, he rises from his seat and departs.</P>
<P  >18.
"He walks neither too fast nor too slow, and he does not go as one
who wants to get away.</P>
<P  >19.
"His robe is worn neither too high nor too low on his body, nor too
tight against his body, nor too loose on his body, nor does the wind
blow his robe away from his body. Dust and dirt do not soil his body.</P>
<P  >20.
"When he has gone to the monastery, he sits down on a seat made
ready. Having sat down, he washes his feet, though he does not
concern himself with grooming his feet. Having washed his feet, he
seats himself cross-legged, sets his body erect, and establishes
mindfulness in front of him. He does not occupy his mind with
self-affliction, or the affliction of others, or the affliction of
both; he sits with his mind set on his own welfare, on the welfare of
others, and on the welfare of both, even on the welfare of the whole
world. [140]</P>
<P  >21.
"When he has gone to the monastery, he teaches the Dhamma to an
audience. He neither flatters nor berates that audience; he
instructs, urges, rouses, and encourages it with talk purely on the
Dhamma. The speech that issues from his mouth has eight qualities: it
is distinct, intelligible, melodious, audible, ringing, euphonious,
deep, and sonorous. But while his voice is intelligible as far as the
audience extends, his speech does not issue out beyond the audience.
When the people have been instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged
by him, they rise from their seats and depart looking only at him and
concerned with nothing else.</P>
<P  >22.
"We have seen Master Gotama walking, sir, we have seen him
standing, we have seen him entering indoors, we have seen him indoors
seated in silence after eating, we have seen him giving the blessing
after eating, we have seen him going to the monastery in silence, we
have seen him in the monastery teaching the Dhamma to an audience.
Such is the Master Gotama; such he is, and more than that. "<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote860anc" HREF="#sdendnote860sym"><SUP>dccclx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
When this was said, the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat, and
after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder, he extended his hands
in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and uttered this
exclamation three times: "Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished
and fully enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and
fully enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened! Perhaps sometime or other we might meet Master Gotama,
perhaps we might have some conversation with him."</P>
<P  >24.
Then, in the course of his wandering, the Blessed One eventually
arrived at Mithila. There the Blessed One lived in Makhadeva's
Mango Grove. The brahmin householders of Mithila heard: [141] "The
recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan
clan, has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large
Sangha of bhikkhus, with five hundred bhikkhus, and he has now come
to Mithila and is living in Makhadeva's Mango Grove. Now a good
report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect … (as in §3
above) … Now it is good to see such arahants."</P>
<P  >25.
Then the brahmin householders of Mithila went to the Blessed One.
Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their hands in
reverential salutation towards him and sat down at one side; some
pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's presence and
sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at one side.</P>
<P  >26.
The brahmin Brahmayu heard: "The recluse Gotama, the son of the
Sakyans who went forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived in Mithila
and is living in Makhadeva's Mango Grove in Mithila."</P>
<P  >Then
the brahmin Brahmayu went to Makhadeva's Mango Grove with a number
of brahmin students. When he came to the Mango Grove, he thought: "It
is not proper that I should go to the recluse Gotama without first
being announced." Then he addressed a certain brahmin student:
"Come, brahmin student, go to the recluse Gotama and ask in my name
whether the recluse Gotama is free from illness and affliction, and
is healthy, strong, and abiding in comfort, saying: 'Master Gotama,
the brahmin Brahmayu asks whether Master Gotama is free from illness
… abiding in comfort,' and say this: 'The brahmin Brahmayu,
Master Gotama, is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life,
and come to the last stage; he is in his hundred and twentieth year.
He is a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy,
phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in
philology and grammar, he is fully versed in natural philosophy and
in the marks of a Great Man. Of all the brahmin householders who live
in Mithila, the brahmin Brahmayu is pronounced the foremost of them
in wealth, in knowledge of the hymns, and in age and fame. [142] He
wants to see Master Gotama.'"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," the brahmin student replied. He went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he stood at one side and delivered his message.
[The Blessed One said:]</P>
<P  >"Now
is the time for the brahmin Brahmayu to do as he thinks fit."</P>
<P  >27.
Then the brahmin student went to the brahmin Brahmayu and said:
"Permission has been granted by the recluse Gotama. Now is the
time, sir, to do as you think fit."</P>
<P  >So
the brahmin Brahmayu went to the Blessed One. The assembly saw him
coming in the distance, and they at once made way for him as for one
who was well known and famous. Then the brahmin Brahmayu said to the
assembly: "Enough, sirs, let each sit down in his own seat. I shall
sit here next to the recluse Gotama."</P>
<P  >28.
Then he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him, and
when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the
Blessed One's body. [143] He saw, more or less, the thirty-two
marks of a Great Man on the Blessed</P>
<P  >One's
body, except two; he was doubtful about two of the marks, and he
could not decide and make up his mind about them: about the male
organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the
tongue.</P>
<P  >29.
Then the brahmin Brahmayu addressed the Blessed One in stanzas:</P>
<P >
"The two-and-thirty marks I learned</P>
<P >
That are the signs of a Great Man –</P>
<P >
I still do not see two of these</P>
<P >
Upon your body, Gotama.</P>
<P >
Is what should be concealed by cloth</P>
<P >
Hid in a sheath, greatest of men?</P>
<P >
Though called by a word of feminine gender,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote861anc" HREF="#sdendnote861sym"><SUP>dccclxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
Perhaps your tongue is a manly one?</P>
<P >
Perhaps your tongue is large as well,</P>
<P >
According to what we have been taught?</P>
<P >
Please put it out a little bit</P>
<P >
And so, O Seer, cure our doubt</P>
<P >
For welfare in this very life</P>
<P >
And happiness in lives to come.</P>
<P >
And now we crave for leave to ask</P>
<P >
Something that we aspire to know."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >30.
Then it occurred to the Blessed One: "This brahmin Brahmayu sees,
more or less, the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on me, except two;
he is doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he cannot
decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being
enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue."</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the
brahmin Brahmayu saw that the Blessed One's male organ was enclosed
in a sheath. Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue, and he
repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered
the whole of his forehead with his tongue.</P>
<P  >31.
Then the Blessed One spoke these stanzas in reply to the brahmin
Brahmayu:</P>
<P >
"The two-and-thirty marks you learned</P>
<P >
That are the signs of a Great Man –</P>
<P >
All on my body can be found:</P>
<P >
So, brahmin, doubt no more on that.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
What must be known is directly known,</P>
<P >
What must be developed has been developed,</P>
<P >
What must be abandoned has been abandoned,</P>
<P >
Therefore, brahmin, I am a Buddha.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote862anc" HREF="#sdendnote862sym"><SUP>dccclxii</SUP></A></SUP>
[144]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
For welfare in this very life</P>
<P >
And happiness in lives to come,</P>
<P >
Since leave is given you, please ask</P>
<P >
Whatever you aspire to know."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >32.
Then the brahmin Brahmayu thought: "Permission has been granted me
by the recluse Gotama. Which should I ask him about: good in this
life or good in the lives to come?" Then he thought: "I am
skilled in the good of this life, and others too ask me about good in
this life. Why shouldn't I ask him only about good in the lives to
come?" Then he addressed the Blessed One in stanzas:</P>
<P >
"How does one become a brahmin?</P>
<P >
And how does one attain to knowledge?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote863anc" HREF="#sdendnote863sym"><SUP>dccclxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
How has one the triple knowledge?</P>
<P >
And how does one become a holy scholar?</P>
<P >
How does one become an arahant?</P>
<P >
And how does one attain completeness?</P>
<P >
How is one a silent sage?</P>
<P >
And how can one be called a Buddha?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote864anc" HREF="#sdendnote864sym"><SUP>dccclxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >33.
Then the Blessed One spoke these stanzas in reply:</P>
<P >
"Who knows about his former lives,</P>
<P >
Sees heaven and states of deprivation,</P>
<P >
And has arrived at birth's destruction –</P>
<P >
A sage who knows by direct knowledge,</P>
<P >
Who knows his mind is purified,</P>
<P >
Entirely freed from every lust,</P>
<P >
Who has abandoned birth and death,</P>
<P >
Who is complete in the holy life,</P>
<P >
Who has transcended everything –</P>
<P >
One such as this is called a Buddha."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote865anc" HREF="#sdendnote865sym"><SUP>dccclxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >34.
When this was said, the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat, and
after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder, he prostrated himself
with his head at the Blessed One's feet, and he covered the Blessed
One's feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands,
pronouncing his name: "I am the brahmin Brahmayu, Master Gotama; I
am the brahmin Brahmayu, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >35.
Those in the assembly wondered and marvelled, and they said: "It is
wonderful, sirs, it is marvellous, what great power and great might
the recluse Gotama has, for the well-known and famous brahmin
Brahmayu to make such a display of humility!"</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One said to the brahmin Brahmayu: [145] "Enough,
brahmin, arise; sit down in your own seat since your mind has
confidence in me."</P>
<P  >The
brahmin Brahmayu then rose and sat down in his own seat.</P>
<P  >36.
The Blessed One then gave him progressive instruction,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote866anc" HREF="#sdendnote866sym"><SUP>dccclxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
that is, talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on the heavens; he
explained the danger, degradation, and defilement in sensual
pleasures and the blessing of renunciation. When he knew that the
brahmin Brahmayu's mind was ready, receptive, free from hindrances,
elated, and confident, he expounded to him the teaching special to
the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just
as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye evenly, so
too, while the brahmin Brahmayu sat there, the spotless immaculate
vision of the Dhamma arose in him: "All that is subject to arising
is subject to cessation." Then the brahmin Brahmayu saw the Dhamma,
attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma; he
crossed beyond doubt, did away with perplexity, gained intrepidity,
and became independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation.</P>
<P  >37.
Then he said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama!
Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear
in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been
overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was
lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see
forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the
Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay
follower who has gone to him for refuge for life. Let the Blessed
One, together with the Sangha of bhikkhus, consent to accept
tomorrow's meal from me."</P>
<P  >The
Blessed One consented in silence. Then, knowing that the Blessed One
had consented, the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat, and after
paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he
departed.</P>
<P  >38.
Then, when the night had ended, the Brahmin Brahmayu had good food of
various kinds prepared in his residence, and he had the time
announced to the Blessed One: "It is time, Master Gotama, the meal
is ready." [146]</P>
<P  >Then,
it being morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and
outer robe, he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the brahmin
Brahmayu's residence and sat down on the seat made ready. Then, for
a week, with his own hands, the Brahmin Brahmayu served and satisfied
the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of
good food.</P>
<P  >39.
At the end of that week, the Blessed One set out to wander in the
country of the Videhans. Soon after he had gone, the brahmin Brahmayu
died. Then a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and said: "Venerable
sir, the brahmin Brahmayu has died. What is his destination? What is
his future course?"</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhus,
the brahmin Brahmayu was wise, he entered into the way of the Dhamma,
and he did not trouble me in the interpretation of the Dhamma. With
the destruction of the five lower fetters, he has reappeared
spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and will there attain final
Nibbana, without ever returning from that world."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
