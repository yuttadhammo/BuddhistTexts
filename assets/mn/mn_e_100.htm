100. Sangarava Sutta - To Sangarava</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a brahmin woman named Dhananjani was staying at
Candalakappa, having full confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and
the Sangha.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote917anc" HREF="#sdendnote917sym"><SUP>cmxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
One time she stumbled, and [on recovering her balance] exclaimed
three times: “Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished [210] and fully
enlightened!”</P>
<P  >3.
At the time there was a brahmin student named Sangarava staying at
Candalakappa. He was a master of the Three Vedas, with their
vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as
the fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he was fully versed in
natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. Having heard the
brahmin woman Dhananjani utter those words, he said to her: “This
brahmin woman Dhananjani must be disgraced and degraded, since when
there are brahmins around she praises that bald-pated recluse.”</P>
<P  >[She
replied:] “My dear sir, you do not know the virtue and wisdom of
the Blessed One. If you knew that Blessed One’s virtue and wisdom,
my dear sir, you would never think of abusing and reviling him.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
madam, inform me when the recluse Gotama comes to Candalakappa.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
dear sir,” the brahmin woman Dhananjani replied.</P>
<P  >4.
Then, after wandering by stages in the Kosalan country, the Blessed
One eventually arrived at Candalakappa. There in Candalakappa the
Blessed One lived in the Mango Grove belonging to the brahmins of the
Todeyya clan.</P>
<P  >5.
The brahmin woman Dhananjani heard that the Blessed One had arrived,
so she went to the brahmin student Sangarava and told him: “My dear
sir, the Blessed One has arrived in Candalakappa and he is living
here in Candalakappa in the Mango Grove belonging to the brahmins of
the Todeyya clan. Now is the time, dear sir, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
madam,” he replied. Then he went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous [211] and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said:</P>
<P  >6.
“Master Gotama, there are some recluses and brahmins who claim [to
teach] the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge here and now.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote918anc" HREF="#sdendnote918sym"><SUP>cmxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Where among these recluses and brahmins does Master Gotama stand?”</P>
<P  >7.
“Bharadvaja, I say that there is a diversity among those recluses
and brahmins who claim [to teach] the fundamentals of the holy life
after having reached. the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge here and now. There are some recluses and brahmins who are
traditionalists, who on the basis of oral tradition claim [to teach]
the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge here and now; such
are the brahmins of the Three Vedas. There are some recluses and
brahmins who, entirely on the basis of mere faith, claim [to teach]
the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge; such are the
reasoners and investigators.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote919anc" HREF="#sdendnote919sym"><SUP>cmxix</SUP></A></SUP>
There are some recluses and brahmins who, having directly known the
Dhamma for themselves<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote920anc" HREF="#sdendnote920sym"><SUP>cmxx</SUP></A></SUP>
among things not heard before, claim [to teach] the fundamentals of
the holy life after having reached the consummation and perfection of
direct knowledge.</P>
<P  >8.
“I, Bharadvaja, am one of those recluses and brahmins who, having
directly known the Dhamma for themselves among things not heard
before, claim [to teach] the fundamentals of the holy life after
having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.
As to how I am one of those recluses and brahmins, that may be
understood in the following way.</P>
<P  >9.
“Here, Bharadvaja, before my enlightenment, while I was still only
an unenlightened Bodhisatta, I considered thus:</P>
<P  >‘Household
life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not
easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and
pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put
on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into
homelessness.’</P>
<P  >10-13.
“Later, Bharadvaja, [212] while still young … (as Sutta 26,
§§14-17) … And I sat down thinking: ‘This will serve for
striving.’</P>
<P  >14-30.
“Now these three similes occurred to me spontaneously never heard
before … (as Sutta 36, §§17-33; but in the present sutta in
§§17-22 - corresponding to §§20-25 of Sutta 36 - the sentence
“But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind
and remain” does not occur) … the five bhikkhus were disgusted
and left me, thinking: ‘The recluse Gotama now lives luxuriously;
he has given up his striving and reverted to luxury.’</P>
<P  >31-41.
“Now when I had eaten solid food and regained my strength, then
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states … (as Sutta 36, §§34-44; but in the present sutta in §§36,
38, and 41 - corresponding to §§39, 41, and 44 of Sutta 36 - the
sentence “But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade
my mind and remain” does not occur) … as happens in one who
abides diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</P>
<P  >42.
When this was said, the brahmin student Sangarava said to the Blessed
One: “Master Gotama’s striving was unfaltering, Master Gotama’s
striving was that of a true man, as it should be for an Accomplished
One, a Fully Enlightened One. But how is it, Master Gotama, are there
gods?”</P>
<P  >“It
is known to me to be the case, Bharadvaja, that there are gods.”</P>
<P  >“But
how is this, Master Gotama, that when you are asked, ‘Are there
gods?’ you say: ‘It is known to me to be the case, Bharadvaja,
that there are gods’? If that is so, isn’t what you say empty and
false?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote921anc" HREF="#sdendnote921sym"><SUP>cmxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Bharadvaja,
when one is asked, ‘Are there gods?’ [213] whether one answers,
‘There are gods,’ or ‘It is known to me to be the case [that
there are gods],’ a wise man can draw the definite conclusion that
there are gods.”</P>
<P  >“But
why didn’t Master Gotama answer me in the first way?”</P>
<P  >“It
is widely accepted in the world, Bharadvaja, that there are gods.”</P>
<P  >43.
When this was said, the brahmin student Sangarava said to the Blessed
One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he
were turning upright what had been overturned, revealing what was
hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in
the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama
for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let
Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for
refuge for life.”</P>
