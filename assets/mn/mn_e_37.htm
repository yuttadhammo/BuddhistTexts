37 Culatanhasankhaya Sutta<BR>The Shorter Discourse on
the<BR>Destruction of Craving</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara's Mother.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Sakka, ruler of gods, went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, he stood at one side and asked: "Venerable sir, how
in brief is a bhikkhu liberated by the destruction of craving, one
who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate security from bondage,
the ultimate holy life, the ultimate goal, one who is foremost among
gods and humans?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote395anc" HREF="#sdendnote395sym"><SUP>cccxcv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
"Here, ruler of gods, a bhikkhu has heard that nothing is worth
adhering to. When a bhikkhu has heard that nothing is worth adhering
to, he directly knows everything; having directly known everything,
he fully understands everything; having fully understood everything,
whatever feeling he feels, whether pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he abides contemplating impermanence in
those feelings, contemplating fading away, contemplating cessation,
contemplating relinquishment. Contemplating thus, he does not cling
to anything in the world. When he does not cling, he is not agitated.
When he is not agitated, he personally attains Nibbana.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote396anc" HREF="#sdendnote396sym"><SUP>cccxcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
[252] He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being.' Briefly, it is in this way, ruler of gods,
that a bhikkhu is liberated by the destruction of craving, one who
has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate security from bondage, the
ultimate holy life, the ultimate goal, one who is foremost among gods
and humans."</P>
<P  >4.
Then Sakka, ruler of gods, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed
One's words, paid homage to the Blessed One, and keeping him on his
right, he vanished at once.</P>
<P  >5.
Now on that occasion the venerable Maha Moggallana was sitting not
far from the Blessed One. Then he considered: "Did that spirit
penetrate to the meaning of the Blessed One's words when he
rejoiced, or did he not? Suppose I found out whether he did or not."</P>
<P  >6.
Then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or
flex his extended arm, the venerable Maha Moggallana vanished from
the Palace of Migara's Mother in the Eastern Park and appeared
among the gods of the Thirty-three.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion Sakka, ruler of gods, was furnished and endowed
a hundredfold with the five kinds of heavenly music, and he was
enjoying it in the Pleasure Park of the Single Lotus. When he saw the
venerable Maha Moggallana coming in the distance, he dismissed the
music, went to the venerable Maha Moggallana, and said to him: "Come,
good sir Moggallana! Welcome, good sir Moggallana! It is long, good
sir Moggallana, since you found an opportunity to come here. Sit
down, good sir Moggallana; this seat is ready."</P>
<P  >The
venerable Maha Moggallana sat down on the seat made ready, and Sakka
took a low seat and sat down at one side. The venerable Maha
Moggallana then asked him:</P>
<P  >8.
"Kosiya,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote397anc" HREF="#sdendnote397sym"><SUP>cccxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
how did the Blessed One state to you in brief deliverance through the
destruction of craving? It would be good if we might also get to hear
that statement."</P>
<P  >"Good
sir Moggallana, we are so busy, we have so much to do, not only with
our own business, but also with the business of the gods of the
Thirty-three. Besides, good sir Moggallana, what is well heard, well
learned, [253] well attended to, well remembered, does not vanish all
of a sudden. Good sir Moggallana, it once happened that war broke out
between the gods and the titans.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote398anc" HREF="#sdendnote398sym"><SUP>cccxcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
In that war the gods won and the titans were defeated. When I had won
that war and returned from it as a conqueror, I had the Vejayanta
Palace built. Good sir Moggallana, the Vejayanta Palace has a hundred
towers, and each tower has seven hundred upper chambers, and each
upper chamber has seven nymphs, and each nymph has seven maids. Would
you like to see the loveliness of the Vejayanta Palace, good sir
Moggallana?" The venerable Maha Moggallana consented in silence.</P>
<P  >9.
Then Sakka, ruler of gods, and the divine King Vessavana<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote399anc" HREF="#sdendnote399sym"><SUP>cccxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the Vejayanta Palace, giving precedence to the venerable Maha
Moggallana. When the maids of Sakka saw the venerable Maha Moggallana
coming in the distance, they were embarrassed and ashamed and they
went each into their own rooms. Just as a daughter-in-law is
embarrassed and ashamed on seeing her father-in-law, so too, when the
maids of Sakka saw the venerable Maha Moggallana coming, they were
embarrassed and ashamed and they went each into their own rooms.</P>
<P  >10.
Then Sakka, ruler of gods, and the divine King Vessavana had the
venerable Maha Moggallana walk all over and explore the Vejayanta
Palace: "See, good sir Moggallana, this loveliness of the Vejayanta
Palace! See, good sir Moggallana, this loveliness of the Vejayanta
Palace!"</P>
<P  >"It
does the venerable Kosiya credit as one who has formerly made merit;
and whenever human beings see anything lovely, they say: 'Sirs, it
does credit to the gods of the Thirty-three!' It does the venerable
Kosiya credit as one who has formerly made merit."</P>
<P  >11.
Then the venerable Maha Moggallana considered thus: "This spirit is
living much too negligently. What if I stirred up a sense of urgency
in him?" Then the venerable Maha Moggallana performed such a feat
of supernormal power that with the point of his toe he made the
Vejayanta Palace shake and quake and tremble.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote400anc" HREF="#sdendnote400sym"><SUP>cd</SUP></A></SUP>
[254] Sakka and the divine King Vessavana and the gods of the
Thirty-three were filled with wonder and amazement, and they said:
"Sirs, it is wonderful, it is marvellous, what power and might the
recluse has, that with the point of his toe he makes the heavenly
region shake and quake and tremble!"</P>
<P  >12.
When the venerable Maha Moggallana knew that Sakka, ruler of the
gods, was stirred to a sense of urgency with his hair standing on
end, he asked him: "Kosiya, how did the Blessed One state to you in
brief deliverance through the destruction of craving? It would be
good if we might also get to hear that statement."</P>
<P  >"Good
sir Moggallana, I went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to
him, I stood at one side and said: 'Venerable sir, … [as in §2]
… of gods and humans?' When this was said, good sir Moggallana,
the Blessed One told me: 'Here, ruler of gods, … [as in §3] …
of gods and humans.' That is how the Blessed One stated to me in
brief deliverance through the destruction of craving, good sir
Moggallana."</P>
<P  >13.
Then the venerable Maha Moggallana delighted and rejoiced in the
words of Sakka, ruler of gods. [255] Then, just as quickly as a
strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, he
vanished from among the gods of the Thirtythree and appeared in the
Eastern Park in the Palace of Migara's Mother.</P>
<P  >14.
Then, soon after the venerable Maha Moggallana had gone, the
attendants of Sakka, ruler of gods, asked him: "Good sir, was that
your teacher, the Blessed One?" - "No, good sirs, that was not my
teacher, the Blessed One. That was one of my companions in the holy
life, the venerable Maha Moggallana."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote401anc" HREF="#sdendnote401sym"><SUP>cdi</SUP></A></SUP>
- "Good sir, it is a gain for you that your companion in the holy
life has such power and might. Oh, how much more so that the Blessed
One is your teacher!"</P>
<P  >15.
Then the venerable Maha Moggallana went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and asked him:
"Venerable sir, does the Blessed One recall stating in brief - to a
certain one of the renowned spirits with a great following
-deliverance through the destruction of craving?"</P>
<P  >"I
do recall doing so, Moggallana. Here Sakka, ruler of gods, came to
me, and after paying homage to me, he stood at one side and asked:
'Venerable sir, how in brief is a bhikkhu liberated by the
destruction of craving, one who has reached the ultimate end, the
ultimate security from bondage, the ultimate holy life, the ultimate
goal, one who is foremost among gods and humans?' When this was
said, I told him: 'Here, ruler of gods, a bhikkhu has heard that
nothing is worth adhering to. When a bhikkhu has heard that nothing
is worth adhering to, he directly knows everything; having directly
known everything, he fully understands everything; having fully
understood everything, whatever feeling he feels, whether pleasant or
painful or neitherpainful-nor-pleasant, he abides contemplating
impermanence in those feelings, contemplating fading away,
contemplating cessation, contemplating relinquishment. Contemplating
thus, he does not cling to anything in the world. When he does not
cling, he is not agitated. When he is not agitated, he personally
attains</P>
<P  >Nibbana.
He understands: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived,
[256] what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being." Briefly, it is in this way, ruler of gods,
that a bhikkhu is liberated by the destruction of craving … one who
is foremost among gods and humans.' That is how I recall stating in
brief to Sakka, ruler of gods, deliverance through the destruction of
craving."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Maha Moggallana was
satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
