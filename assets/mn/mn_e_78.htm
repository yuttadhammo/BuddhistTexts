78. Samanamandika Sutta - Samanamandikaputta</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Now on that
occasion the wanderer Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta was staying in
Mallika's Park, the single-hailed Tinduka plantation for
philosophical debates,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote771anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote771sym"><SUP>dcclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
[23] together with a large following of wanderers, with as many as
three hundred wanderers.</P>
<P  >2.
The carpenter Pancakanga went out from Savatthi at midday in order to
see the Blessed One. Then he thought: "It is not the right time to
see the Blessed One; he is still in retreat. And it is not the right
time to see bhikkhus worthy of esteem; they are still in retreat.
Suppose I went to Mallika's Park, to the wanderer Uggahamana
Samanamandikaputta?" And he went to Mallika's Park.</P>
<P  >3.
Now on that occasion the wanderer Uggahamana was seated with a large
assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar, loudly and noisily
talking many kinds of pointless talk, such as talk of kings ... (as
Sutta 76, ยง4) ... whether things are so or are not so.</P>
<P  >The
wanderer Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta saw the carpenter Pancakanga
coming in the distance. Seeing him, he quieted his own assembly thus:
"Sirs, be quiet; sirs make no noise. Here comes the carpenter
Pancakanga, a disciple of the recluse Gotama, one of the recluse
Gotama's white-clothed lay disciples staying at Savatthi. These
venerable ones like quiet; they are disciplined in quiet; they
commend quiet. Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one, he will
think to join us." Then the wanderers became silent.</P>
<P  >4.
The carpenter Pancakanga went to the wanderer Uggahamana and
exchanged greetings with him. [24] When this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The wanderer Uggahamana
then said to him:</P>
<P  >5.
"Carpenter, when a man possesses four qualities, I describe him as
accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome,
attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic invincible. What are
the four? Here he does no evil bodily actions, he utters no evil
speech, he has no evil intentions, and he does not make his living by
any evil livelihood. When a man possesses these four qualities, I
describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what
is wholesome, attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic
invincible."</P>
<P  >6.
Then the carpenter Pancakanga neither approved nor disapproved of the
wanderer Uggahamana's words. Without doing either he rose from his
seat and went away, thinking: "I shall learn the meaning of this
statement in the presence of the Blessed One."</P>
<P  >7.
Then he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he
sat down at one side and reported to the Blessed One his entire
conversation with the wanderer Uggahamana. Thereupon the Blessed One
said:</P>
<P  >8.
"If that were so, carpenter, then a young tender infant lying prone
is accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome,
attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic invincible, according
to the wanderer Uggahamana's statement. For a young tender infant
lying prone does not even have the notion 'body,' so how should
he do an evil action beyond mere wriggling? A young tender infant
lying prone does not even have the notion 'speech,' so how should
he utter evil speech beyond mere whining? A young tender infant lying
prone does not even have the notion 'intention,' so how should he
have evil intentions beyond mere sulking? A young tender infant lying
prone does not even have the notion 'livelihood,' so how [25]
should he make his living by evil livelihood beyond being suckled at
his mother's breast? If that were so, carpenter, then a young
tender infant lying prone is accomplished in what is wholesome ...
according to the wanderer Uggahamana's statement.</P>
<P  >"When
a man possesses four qualities, carpenter, I describe him, not as
accomplished in what is wholesome or perfected in what is wholesome
or attained to the supreme attainment or an ascetic invincible, but
as one who stands in the same category as the young tender infant
lying prone. What are the four? Here he does no evil bodily actions,
he utters no evil speech, he has no evil intentions, and he does not
make his living by any evil livelihood. When a man possesses these
four qualities, I describe him, not as accomplished ... but as one
who stands in the same category as the young tender infant lying
prone.</P>
<P  >9.
"When a man possesses ten qualities, carpenter, I describe him as
accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome,
attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic invincible. [But first
of all] I say, it must be understood thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote772anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote772sym"><SUP>dcclxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
'These are unwholesome habits,' and thus: 'Unwholesome habits
originate from this,' and thus: 'Unwholesome habits cease without
remainder here,' and thus: 'One practising in this way is
practising the way to the cessation of unwholesome habits.' And I
say, it must be understood thus: 'These are wholesome habits,'
and thus: 'Wholesome habits originate from this,' and thus:
'Wholesome habits cease without remainder here,' and thus: 'One
practising in this way is practising the way to the cessation of
wholesome habits.' And I say, it must be understood thus: 'These
are unwholesome intentions,' and thus 'Unwholesome intentions
originate from this,' [26] and thus: 'Unwholesome intentions
cease without remainder here,' and thus 'One practising in this
way is practising the way to the cessation of unwholesome
intentions.' And I say, it must be understood thus: 'These are
wholesome intentions,' and thus: 'Wholesome intentions originate
from this,' and thus: 'Wholesome intentions cease without
remainder here,' and thus: 'One practising in this way is
practising the way to the cessation of wholesome intentions.'</P>
<P  >10.
"What are unwholesome habits? They are unwholesome bodily actions,
unwholesome verbal actions, and evil livelihood. These are called
unwholesome habits.</P>
<P  >"And
what do these unwholesome habits originate from? Their origin is
stated: they should be said to originate from mind. What mind? Though
mind is multiple, varied, and of different aspects, there is mind
affected by lust, by hate, and by delusion. Unwholesome habits
originate from this.</P>
<P  >"And
where do these unwholesome habits cease without remainder? Their
cessation is stated: here a bhikkhu abandons</P>
<P  >bodily
misconduct and develops good bodily conduct; he abandons verbal
misconduct and develops good verbal conduct; he abandons mental
misconduct and develops good mental conduct; he abandons wrong
livelihood and gains a living by right livelihood.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote773anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote773sym"><SUP>dcclxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
It is here that unwholesome habits cease without remainder.</P>
<P  >"And
how practising does he practise the way to the cessation of
unwholesome habits? Here a bhi.kkhu awakens zeal for the non-arising
of unarisen evil unwholesome states and he makes effort, arouses
energy, exerts his mind, and strives. He awakens zeal for the
abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome states ... He awakens zeal for
the arising of unarisen wholesome states ... He awakens zeal for the
continuance, non-disappearance, strengthening, increase, and
fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. [27] One so
practising practises the way to the cessation of unwholesome habits
.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote774anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote774sym"><SUP>dcclxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
"What are wholesome habits? They are wholesome bodily actions,
wholesome verbal actions, and purification of livelihood. These are
called wholesome habits.</P>
<P  >"And
what do these wholesome habits originate from? Their origin is
stated: they should be said to originate from mind. What mind? Though
mind is multiple, varied, and of different aspects, there is mind
unaffected by lust, by hate, or by delusion. Wholesome habits
originate from this.</P>
<P  >"And
where do these wholesome habits cease without remainder? Their
cessation is stated: here a bhikkhu is virtuous, but he does not
identify with his virtue, and he understands as it actually is that
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom where these wholesome
habits cease without remainder.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote775anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote775sym"><SUP>dcclxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"And
how practising does he practise the way to the cessation of wholesome
habits? Here a bhikkhu awakens zeal for the nonarising of unarisen
evil unwholesome states ... for the continuance, non-disappearance,
strengthening, increase, and fulfilment by development of arisen
wholesome states, and he makes effort, arouses energy, exerts his
mind, and strives. One so practising practises the way to the

<P  >12.
"What are unwholesome intentions? They are the intention of sensual
desire, the intention of ill will, and the intention of cruelty.
These are called unwholesome intentions.</P>
<P  >"And
what do these unwholesome intentions originate from? Their origin is
stated: they should be said to originate from perception. What
perception? Though perception is multiple, varied, and of different
aspects, there is perception of sensual desire, perception of ill
will, and perception of cruelty. Unwholesome intentions originate
from this.</P>
<P  >"And
where do these unwholesome intentions cease without remainder? Their
cessation is stated: here, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from [28] unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. It is
here that unwholesome intentions cease without remainder.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote777anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote777sym"><SUP>dcclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

cessation is stated: here with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which
has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.
It is here that these wholesome intentions cease without remainder.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote779anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote779sym"><SUP>dcclxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>

"Now, carpenter, when a man possesses what ten qualities [29] do I
describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what
is wholesome, attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic
invincible? Here a bhikkhu possesses the right view of one beyond
training,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote781anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote781sym"><SUP>dcclxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
the right intention of one beyond training, the right speech of one
beyond training, the right action of one beyond training, the right
livelihood of one beyond training, the right effort of one beyond
training, the right mindfulness of one beyond training, the right
concentration of one beyond training, the right knowledge of one
beyond training, and the right deliverance of one beyond training.
When a man possesses these ten qualities, I describe him as
accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome,
attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic invincible."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The carpenter Pancakanga was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
