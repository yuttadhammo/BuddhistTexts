71. Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta - To Vacchagotta on the<BR>Threefold
True Knowledge</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the wanderer Vacchagotta was staying in the
Wanderers’ Park of the Single White-lotus Mango Tree.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote712anc" HREF="#sdendnote712sym"><SUP>dccxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Vesali for alms. Then the Blessed One
thought: “It is still too early to wander for alms in Vesali.
Suppose I went to the wanderer Vacchagotta in the Wanderers’ Park
of the Single White-lotus Mango Tree.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One went to the wanderer Vacchagotta in the
Wanderers’ Park of the Single White-lotus Mango Tree. The wanderer
Vacchagotta saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and said to
him: “Let the Blessed One come, venerable sir! Welcome to the
Blessed One! It is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to
come here. Let the Blessed One be seated; this seat is ready.” The
Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready, and the wanderer
Vacchagotta [482] took a low seat, sat down at one side, and said to
the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >5.
“Venerable sir, I have heard this: ‘The recluse Gotama claims to
be omniscient and all-seeing, to have complete knowledge and vision
thus: “Whether I am walking or standing or sleeping or awake,
knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to
me.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote713anc" HREF="#sdendnote713sym"><SUP>dccxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
Venerable sir, do those who speak thus say what has been said by the
Blessed One, and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact?
Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that
nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately
deduced from their assertion?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
those who say thus do not say what has been said by me, but
misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote714anc" HREF="#sdendnote714sym"><SUP>dccxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“Venerable sir, how should I answer that I may say what has been
said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is
contrary to fact? How may I explain in accordance with the Dhamma in
such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be
legitimately deduced from my assertion?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
if you answer thus: ‘The recluse Gotama has the threefold true
knowledge,’ you will be saying what has been said by me and will
not misrepresent me with what is contrary to fact. You will explain
in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which
provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from your
assertion.</P>
<P  >7.
“For in so far as I wish, I recollect my manifold past lives, that
is, one birth, two births … (as Sutta 51, §24) … Thus with their
aspects and particulars I recollect my manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >8.
“And in so far as I wish, with the divine eye, which is purified
and surpasses the human, I see beings passing away and reappearing,
inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and
I understand how beings pass on according to their actions … (as
Sutta 51, §25) …</P>
<P  >9.
“And by realising for myself with direct knowledge, I here and now
enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by
wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints.</P>
<P  >10.
“If you answer thus: ‘The recluse Gotama has the threefold true
knowledge,’ [483] you will be saying what has been said by me and
will not misrepresent me with what is contrary to fact. You will
explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing
which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from
your assertion.”</P>
<P  >11.
When this was said, the wanderer Vacchagotta asked the Blessed One:
“Master Gotama, is there any householder who, without abandoning
the fetter of householdership, on the dissolution of the body has
made an end of suffering?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote715anc" HREF="#sdendnote715sym"><SUP>dccxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
there is no householder who, without abandoning the fetter of
householdership, on the dissolution of the body has made an end of
suffering.”</P>
<P  >12.
“Master Gotama, is there any householder who, without abandoning
the fetter of householdership, on the dissolution of the body has
gone to heaven?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
there are not only one hundred or two or three or four or five
hundred, but far more householders who, without abandoning the fetter
of householdership, on the dissolution of the body have gone to
heaven.”</P>
<P  >13.
“Master Gotama, is there any Ajivaka who, on the dissolution of the
body, has made an end of suffering?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote716anc" HREF="#sdendnote716sym"><SUP>dccxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
there is no Ajivaka who, on the dissolution of the body, has made an
end of suffering.”</P>
<P  >14.
“Master Gotama, is there any Ajivaka who, on the dissolution of the
body, has gone to heaven?”</P>
<P  >“When
I recollect the past ninety-one aeons, Vaccha, I do not recall any
Ajivaka who, on the dissolution of the body, went to heaven, with one
exception, and he held the doctrine of the moral efficacy of action,
the doctrine of the moral efficacy of deeds.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote717anc" HREF="#sdendnote717sym"><SUP>dccxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
“That being so, Master Gotama, this fold of other sectarians is
empty even of [a chance of] going to heaven.”</P>
<P  >“That
being so, Vaccha, this fold of other sectarians is empty even of [a
chance of] going to heaven.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The wanderer Vacchagotta was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
