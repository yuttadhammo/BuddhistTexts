123. Acchariya-abbhuta Sutta - Wonderful and Marvellous</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now a number of bhikkhus were sitting in the assembly hall, where
they had met together on returning from their almsround, after their
meal, when this discussion arose among them: "It is wonderful,
friends, it is marvellous, how mighty and powerful is the Tathagata!
For he is able to know about the Buddhas of the past - who attained
to final Nibbana, cut [the tangle of] proliferation, broke the cycle,
ended the round, and surmounted all suffering - that for those
Blessed Ones their birth was thus, their names were thus, their clans
were thus, their virtue was thus, their state [of concentration] was
thus, their wisdom was thus, their abiding [in attainments] was thus,
their deliverance was thus."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1160anc" HREF="#sdendnote1160sym"><SUP>mclx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >When
this was said, the venerable Ananda told the bhikkhus: "Friends,
Tathagatas are wonderful and have wonderful qualities. Tathagatas are
marvellous and have marvellous qualities." [119]</P>
<P  >However,
their discussion was interrupted; for the Blessed One rose from
meditation when it was evening, went to the assembly hall, and sat
down on a seat made ready. Then he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
"Bhikkhus, for what discussion are you sitting together here now?
And what was your discussion that was interrupted?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
venerable sir, we were sitting in the assembly hall, where we had met
together on returning from our almsround, after our meal, when this
discussion arose among us: 'It is wonderful, friends, it is
marvellous … their deliverance was thus.' When this was said,
venerable sir, the venerable Ananda said to us: 'Friends,
Tathagatas are wonderful and have wonderful qualities. Tathagatas are
marvellous and have marvellous qualities.' This was our discussion,
venerable sir, that was interrupted when the Blessed One arrived."</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda: "That being so,
Ananda, explain more fully the Tathagata's wonderful and marvellous
qualities."</P>
<P  >3.
"1 heard and learned this, venerable sir, from the Blessed One's
own lips: 'Mindful and fully aware, Ananda, the Bodhisatta appeared
in the Tusita heaven.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1161anc" HREF="#sdendnote1161sym"><SUP>mclxi</SUP></A></SUP>
That [120] mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta appeared in the
Tusita heaven - this I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality
of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >4.
"1 heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips:
'Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita
heaven.' This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality
of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >5.
"1 heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'For
the whole of his life-span the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita
heaven.' This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality
of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >6.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips:
'Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita
heaven and descended into his mother's womb.' This too I remember
as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >7.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven and descended into
his mother's womb, then a great immeasurable light surpassing the
splendour of the gods appeared in the world with its gods, its Maras,
and its Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins,
with its princes and its people. And even in those abysmal world
interspaces of vacancy, gloom, and utter darkness, where the moon and
the sun, mighty and powerful as they are, cannot make their light
prevail - there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the
splendour of the gods appeared.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1162anc" HREF="#sdendnote1162sym"><SUP>mclxii</SUP></A></SUP>
And the beings born there perceived each other by that light: "So
other beings, indeed, have appeared here." And this
ten-thousandfold world system shook and quaked and trembled, and
there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the
gods appeared.' This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous
quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >8.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta had descended into his mother's womb, four young
deities came to guard him at the four quarters so that no humans or
non-humans or anyone at all could harm the Bodhisatta or his
mother.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1163anc" HREF="#sdendnote1163sym"><SUP>mclxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
Blessed One.</P>
<P  >9.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta had descended into his mother's womb, she became
intrinsically virtuous, refraining from killing living beings, from
taking what is not given, from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from
false speech, and from wines, liquors, and intoxicants, which are the
basis of negligence.' This too I remember as a wonderful and
marvellous quality of the Blessed One. [121]</P>
<P  >10.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta had descended into his mother's womb, no sensual
thought arose in her concerning men, and she was inaccessible to any
man having a lustful mind.' This too I remember as a wonderful and
marvellous quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >11.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta had descended into his mother's womb, she obtained
the five cords of sensual pleasure, and furnished and endowed with
them, she enjoyed herself with them.' This too I remember as a
wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >12.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta had descended into his mother's womb, no kind of
affliction arose in her; she was blissful and free from bodily
fatigue. She saw the Bodhisatta within her womb with all his limbs,
lacking no faculty. Suppose a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown
thread were strung through a fine beryl gem of purest water,
eight-faceted, well cut, and a man with good sight were to take it in
his hand and review it thus: "This is a fine beryl gem of purest
water, eight-faceted, well cut, and through it is strung a blue,
yellow, red, white, or brown thread"; so too when the Bodhisatta
had descended into his mother's womb … she saw the Bodhisatta
within her womb with all his limbs, lacking no faculty.' This too I
remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.
[122]</P>
<P  >13.
"1 heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'Seven
days after the birth of the Bodhisatta, his mother died and
reappeared in the Tusita heaven.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1164anc" HREF="#sdendnote1164sym"><SUP>mclxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
Blessed One.</P>
<P  >14.
"1 heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'Other
women give birth after carrying the child in the womb for nine or ten
months, but not so the Bodhisatta's mother. The Bodhisatta's
mother gave birth after carrying him in her womb for exactly ten
months.' This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality
of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >15.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'Other
women give birth seated or lying down, but not so the Bodhisatta's
mother. The Bodhisatta's mother gave birth to him standing up.'
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
Blessed One.</P>
<P  >16.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta came forth from his mother's womb, first gods
received him, then human beings.' This too I remember as a
wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >17.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta came forth from his mother's womb, he did not touch
the earth. The four young gods received him and set him before his
mother saying: "Rejoice, 0 queen, a son of great power has been
born to you.'"This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous
quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >18.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta came forth from his mother's womb, he came forth
unsullied, unsmeared [123] by water or humours or blood or any kind
of impurity, clean, and unsullied. Suppose there were a gem placed on
Kasi cloth, then the gem would not smear the cloth or the cloth the
gem. Why is that? Because of the purity of both. So too when the
Bodhisatta came forth … clean and unsullied.' This too I remember
as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >19.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta came forth from his mother's womb, two jets of water
appeared to pour from the sky, one cool and one warm, for bathing the
Bodhisatta and his mother.'</P>
<P  >This
too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed
One.</P>
<P  >20.
"I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'As
soon as the Bodhisatta was born, he stood firmly with his feet on the
ground; then he took seven steps north, and with a white parasol held
over him, he surveyed each quarter and uttered the words of the
Leader of the Herd: "I am the highest in the world; I am the best
in the world; I am the foremost in the world. This is my last birth;
now there is no renewal of being for me.'"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1165anc" HREF="#sdendnote1165sym"><SUP>mclxv</SUP></A></SUP>
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the
Blessed One.</P>
<P  >21.
"1 heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips: 'When
the Bodhisatta came forth from his mother's womb, then a great
immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in
the world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, in this
generation with its recluses and brahmins, with its princes and its
people. And even in those abysmal world interspaces of vacancy,
gloom, and utter darkness, where the moon and the sun, mighty and
powerful as they are, cannot make their light prevail - [124] there
too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods
appeared. And the beings born there perceived each other by that
light: "So other beings, indeed, have appeared here." And this
ten-thousandfold world system shook and quaked and trembled, and
there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the
gods appeared.' That when the Bodhisatta came forth from his
mother's womb, then a great immeasurable light surpassing the
splendour of the gods appeared … this too I remember as a wonderful
and marvellous quality of the Blessed One."</P>
<P  >22.
"That being so, Ananda, remember this too as a wonderful and
marvellous quality of the Tathagata: Here, Ananda, for the Tathagata
feelings are known as they arise, as they are present, as they
disappear; perceptions are known as they arise, as they are present,
as they disappear; thoughts are known as they arise, as they are
present, as they disappear.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1166anc" HREF="#sdendnote1166sym"><SUP>mclxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Remember this too, Ananda, as a wonderful and marvellous quality of
the Tathagata."</P>
<P  >23.
"Venerable sir, since for the Blessed One feelings are known as
they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; perceptions are
known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; thoughts
are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear -
this too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
Blessed One."</P>
<P  >That
is what the venerable Ananda said. The Teacher approved. The bhikkhus
were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Ananda's words.</P>
