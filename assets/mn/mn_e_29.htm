29. Mahasaropama Sutta - The Greater Discourse<BR>on the Simile of
the Heartwood</H2>
<P  >[192]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha on the mountain Vulture Peak; it was soon after Devadatta
had left.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote346anc" HREF="#sdendnote346sym"><SUP>cccxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
There, referring to Devadatta, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, here some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home
life into homelessness, considering: ‘I am a victim of birth,
ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair;
I am a victim of suffering, a prey to suffering. Surely an ending of
this whole mass of suffering can be known.’ When he has gone forth
thus, he acquires gain, honour, and renown. He is pleased with that
gain, honour, and renown, and his intention is fulfilled. On account
of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus: ‘I have gain,
honour, and renown, but these other bhikkhus are unknown, of no
account.’ He becomes intoxicated with that gain, honour, and
renown, grows negligent, falls into negligence, and being negligent,
he lives in suffering.</P>
<P  >“Suppose
a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood.
Passing over its heartwood, its sapwood, its inner bark, and its
outer bark, he would cut off its twigs and leaves and take them away
thinking they were heartwood. Then a man with good sight, seeing him,
might say: ‘This good man did not know the heartwood, the sapwood,
the inner bark, the outer bark, or the twigs and leaves. Thus, while
needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, he came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood,
and passing over its heartwood, its sapwood, its inner bark, and its
outer bark, he cut off its twigs and leaves and took them away
thinking they were heartwood. Whatever it was this good man had to
make with heartwood, his purpose will not be served.’ So too,
bhikkhus, here some clansman goes forth out of faith … [193] … he
lives in suffering. This bhikkhu is called one who has taken the
twigs and leaves of the holy life and stopped short with that.</P>
<P  >3.
“Here, bhikkhus, some clansman goes forth out of faith from the
home life into homelessness, considering: ‘I am a victim of birth,
ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair;
I am a victim of suffering, a prey to suffering. Surely an ending of
this whole mass of suffering can be known.’ When he has gone forth
thus, he acquires gain, honour, and renown. He is not pleased with
that gain, honour, and renown, and his intention is not fulfilled. He
does not, on account of it, laud himself and disparage others. He
does not become intoxicated with that gain, honour, and renown; he
does not grow negligent and fall into negligence. Being diligent, he
achieves the attainment of virtue. He is pleased with that attainment
of virtue and his intention is fulfilled. On account of it he lauds
himself and disparages others thus: ‘I am virtuous, of good
character, but these other bhikkhus are immoral, of evil character.’
He becomes intoxicated with that attainment of virtue, grows
negligent, falls into negligence, and being negligent, he lives in
suffering.</P>
<P  >“Suppose
a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood.
Passing over its heartwood, its sapwood, and its inner bark, he would
cut off its outer bark and take it away thinking it was heartwood.
Then a man with good sight, seeing him, might say: ‘This good man
did not know the heartwood … or the twigs and leaves. Thus, while
needing heartwood … he cut off its outer bark and took it away
thinking it was heartwood. Whatever it was this good man had to make
with heartwood, his purpose will not be served.’ So too, bhikkhus,
here some clansman goes forth out of faith … he lives in suffering.
[194] This bhikkhu is called one who has taken the outer bark of the
holy life and stopped short with that.</P>
<P  >4.
“Here, bhikkhus, some clansman goes forth out of faith from the
home life into homelessness, considering: ‘I am a victim of birth,
ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair;
I am a victim of suffering, a prey to suffering. Surely an ending of
this whole mass of suffering can be known.’ When he has gone forth
thus, he acquires gain, honour, and renown. He is not pleased with
that gain, honour, and renown, and his intention is not fulfilled …
Being diligent, he achieves the attainment of virtue. He is pleased
with that attainment of virtue, but his intention is not fulfilled.
He does not, on account of it, laud himself and disparage others. He
does not become intoxicated with that attainment of virtue; he does
not grow negligent and fall into negligence. Being diligent, he
achieves the attainment of concentration. He is pleased with that
attainment of concentration and his intention is fulfilled. On
account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus: ‘I am
concentrated, my mind is unified, but these other bhikkhus are
unconcentrated, with their minds astray.’ He becomes intoxicated
with that attainment of concentration, grows negligent, falls into
negligence, and being negligent, he lives in suffering.</P>
<P  >“Suppose
a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood.
Passing over its heartwood and its sapwood, he would cut off its
inner bark and take it away thinking it was heartwood. Then a man
with good sight, seeing him, might say: ‘This good man did not know
the heartwood … or the twigs and leaves. Thus, while needing
heartwood … he cut off its inner bark and took it away thinking it
was heartwood. Whatever it was this good man had to make with
heartwood, his purpose will not be served.’ So too, bhikkhus, here
some clansman goes forth out of faith … he lives in suffering.
[195] This bhikkhu is called one who has taken the inner bark of the

“Here, bhikkhus, some clansman goes forth out of faith from the

I am a victim of suffering, a prey to suffering. Surely an ending of

Being diligent, he achieves the attainment of virtue. He is pleased
with that attainment of virtue, but his intention is not fulfilled …
Being diligent, he achieves the attainment of concentration. He is
pleased with that attainment of concentration, but his intention is
not fulfilled. He does not, on account of it, laud himself and
disparage others. He does not become intoxicated with that attainment
of concentration; he does not grow negligent and fall into
negligence. Being diligent, he achieves knowledge and vision.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote347anc" HREF="#sdendnote347sym"><SUP>cccxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
He is pleased with that knowledge and vision and his intention is
fulfilled. On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others
thus: ‘I live knowing and seeing, but these other bhikkhus live
unknowing and unseeing.’ He becomes intoxicated with that knowledge
and vision, grows negligent, falls into negligence, and being
negligent, he lives in suffering.</P>
<P  >“Suppose

<P  >6.
“Here, bhikkhus, some clansman goes forth out of faith from the

vision, but his intention is not fulfilled. He does not, on account
of it, laud himself and disparage others. He does not become
intoxicated with that knowledge and vision; he does not grow
negligent and fall into negligence. Being diligent, he attains
perpetual liberation. And it is impossible for that bhikkhu to fall
away from that perpetual deliverance.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote348anc" HREF="#sdendnote348sym"><SUP>cccxlviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Suppose
a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, and
cutting off only its heartwood, he would take it away knowing it was
heartwood. Then a man with good sight, seeing him, might say: ‘This
good man knew the heartwood, the sapwood, the inner bark, the outer
bark, and the twigs and leaves. Thus, while needing heartwood,
seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, [197] he came to
a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, and cutting off only
its heartwood, he took it away knowing it was heartwood. Whatever it
was this good man had to make with heartwood, his purpose will be

faith … When he is diligent, he attains perpetual liberation. And
it is impossible for that bhikkhu to fall away from that perpetual
deliverance.</P>
<P  >7.
“So this holy life, bhikkhus, does not have gain, honour, and
renown for its benefit, or the attainment of virtue for its benefit,
or the attainment of concentration for its benefit, or knowledge and
vision for its benefit. But it is this unshakeable deliverance of
mind that is the goal of this holy life, its heart wood, and its
end.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote349anc" HREF="#sdendnote349sym"><SUP>cccxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
