94. Ghotamukha Sutta - To Ghotamukha</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Udena was living at
Benares in the Khemiya Mango Grove.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Ghotamukha had arrived in Benares
for some business or other. As he was [158] walking and wandering for
exercise, he came to the Khemiya Mango Grove. At the time the
venerable Udena was walking up and down in the open. Then the brahmin
Ghotamukha went up to the venerable Udena and exchanged greetings
with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, still
walking up and down with the venerable Udena, he said this: "Worthy
recluse, there is no wanderers' life that accords with the Dhamma:
so it seems to me here, and that may be because I have not seen such
venerable ones as yourself or [because I have not seen] the Dhamma
here."</P>
<P  >3.
When this was said, the venerable Udena stepped down from the walk
and went into his dwelling, where he sat down on a seat made ready.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote877anc" HREF="#sdendnote877sym"><SUP>dccclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
And Ghotamukha too stepped down from the walk and went into the
dwelling, where he stood at one side. Then the venerable Udena said
to him: "There are seats, brahmin, sit down if you wish."</P>
<P  >"We
did not sit down because we were waiting for Master Udena [to speak].
For how could one like myself presume to sit down on a seat without
first being invited to do so?"</P>
<P  >4.
Then the brahmin Ghotamukha took a low seat, sat down at one side,
and said to the venerable Udena: "Worthy recluse, there is no
wanderers' life that accords with the Dhamma: so it seems to me
here, and that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as
yourself or [because I have not seen] the Dhamma here."</P>
<P  >"Brahmin,
if you think any statement of mine is to be agreed with, then agree
with it; if you think any statement of mine is to be argued against,
then argue against it; and if you do not understand the meaning of
any statement of mine, ask me to clarify it thus: 'How is this,
Master Udena? What is the meaning of this?' In this way we can
discuss this matter."</P>
<P  >"Master
Udena, if I think any statement of Master Udena's is to be agreed
with, I shall agree with it; if I think any statement of his is to be
argued against, I shall argue against it; and if I [159] do not
understand the meaning of any statement of Master Udena's, then I
shall ask Master Udena to clarify it thus: 'How is this Master
Udena? What is the meaning of this?' In this way let us discuss
this matter."</P>
<P  >5-6.
"Brahmin, there are four kinds of persons to be found existing in
the world. What four?" … (as Sutta 51, §§5-6) [160] …</P>
<P  >"But,
Master Udena, the kind of person who does not torment himself or
pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not torment
others or pursue the practice of torturing others; who, since he
torments neither himself nor others, is here and now hungerless,
extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing bliss, having
himself become holy - he does not torment and torture either himself
or others, both of whom desire pleasure and recoil from pain. That is
why this kind of person satisfies my mind."</P>
<P  >7.
"Brahmin, there are two kinds of assembly. What two? Here a certain
assembly lusts after jewels and earrings and seeks wives and
children, men and women slaves, fields and land, gold and silver. But
here a certain assembly does not lust after jewels and earrings, but
having abandoned wives and children, men and women slaves, fields and
land, gold and silver, has gone forth from the home life into
homelessness. Now there is this kind of person who does not torment
himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not
torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others; who, since
he torments neither himself nor others, is here and now hungerless,
extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing bliss, having
himself become holy. In which of the two kinds of assembly do you
usually see this person, brahmin - in the assembly that lusts after
jewels and earrings and seeks wives and children, men and women
slaves, fields and land, gold and silver; or in the assembly that
does not lust after jewels and earrings, but having abandoned wives
and children … has gone forth from the home life into
homelessness?"</P>
<P  >[161]
"I usually see this kind of person, Master Udena, in the assembly
that does not lust after jewels and earrings, but having abandoned
wives and children … has gone forth from the home life into
homelessness."</P>
<P  >8.
"But only just now, brahmin, we understood you to say: 'Worthy
recluse, there is no wanderers' life that accords with the Dhamma:
so it seems to me here, and that may be because I have not seen such
venerable ones as yourself or [because I have not seen] the Dhamma
here.'"</P>
<P  >"Certainly,
Master Udena, it was in order to learn that I spoke those words.
There is a wanderers' life that accords with the Dhamma; so it
seems to me here, and may Master Udena remember me [to have spoken]
thus. It would be good if, out of compassion, Master Udena would
expound to me in detail those four kinds of persons he mentioned in
brief."</P>
<P  >9.
"Then, brahmin, listen and attend closely to what I shall say." -
"Yes, sir," the brahmin Ghotamukha replied. The venerable Udena
said this:</P>
<P  >10-30.
"Brahmin, what kind of person torments himself and pursues the
practice of torturing himself? Here a certain person goes naked …
(as Sutta 51, §§8-28) [162] … and abides experiencing bliss,
having himself become holy."</P>
<P  >31.
When this was said, the brahmin Ghotamukha said to the venerable
Udena: "Magnificent, Master Udena! Magnificent, Master Udena!
Master Udena has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he
were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was
hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in
the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Udena
for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From
today let Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone to
him for refuge for life."</P>
<P  >32.
"Do not go to me for refuge, brahmin. Go for refuge to that same
Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge."</P>
<P  >"Where
is he living now, that Master Gotama, accomplished and fully
enlightened, Master Udena?"</P>
<P  >"That
Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, has attained final
Nibbana, brahmin."</P>
<P  >"If
we heard that Master Gotama was within ten leagues, we would go ten
leagues in order to see that Master Gotama, accomplished and fully
enlightened. If we heard that Master Gotama was within twenty leagues
… thirty leagues … forty leagues … fifty leagues … a hundred
leagues, [163] we would go a hundred leagues in order to see that
Master Gotama, accomplished and fully enlightened. But since that
Master Gotama has attained to final Nibbana, we go to that Master
Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus.
From today let Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has
gone for refuge for life.</P>
<P  >33.
"Now, Master Udena, the king of Anga gives me a daily donation. Let
me give Master Udena a regular donation from that."</P>
<P  >"What
kind of regular donation does the king of Anga give you, brahmin?"</P>
<P  >"Five
hundred kahapanas, Master Udena."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote878anc" HREF="#sdendnote878sym"><SUP>dccclxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"It
is not allowable for us to accept gold and silver, brahmin." "If
it is not allowable for Master Udena, I will have a monastery built
for Master Udena."</P>
<P  >"If
you desire to have a monastery built for me, brahmin, have an
assembly hall built for the Sangha at Pataliputta."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote879anc" HREF="#sdendnote879sym"><SUP>dccclxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"I
am still more satisfied and pleased that Master Udena suggests that I
give a gift to the Sangha. So with this regular donation and another
regular donation, I shall have an assembly hall built for the Sangha
at Pataliputta."</P>
<P  >Then
with that regular donation [which he offered to Master Udena] and
another regular donation [added to it], the brahmin Ghotamukha had an
assembly hall built for the Sangha at Pataliputta. And that is now
known as the Ghotamukhi.</P>
