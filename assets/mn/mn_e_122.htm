122. Mahasunnata Sutta - The Greater Discourse on Voidness</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1145anc" HREF="#sdendnote1145sym"><SUP>mcxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at
Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Kapilavatthu for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu and had returned from his
almsround, after his meal he went for his daytime abiding to the
dwelling of Kalakhemaka the Sakyan. Now on that occasion there were
many resting places prepared in Kalakhemaka the Sakyari s dwelling.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1146anc" HREF="#sdendnote1146sym"><SUP>mcxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
When the Blessed One saw this, [110] he thought: "There are many
resting places prepared in Kalakhemaka the Sakyan's dwelling. Do
many bhikkhus live there?"</P>
<P  >Now
on that occasion the venerable Ananda, along with many bhikkhus, was
busy making robes at Ghata the Sakyan's dwelling. Then, when it was
evening, the Blessed One rose from retreat and went to Ghata the
Sakyan's dwelling. 'There he sat down on a seat made ready and
asked the venerable Ananda:</P>
<P  >"Ananda,
there are many resting places prepared in Kalakhemaka the Sakyan's
dwelling. Do many bhikkhus live there?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1147anc" HREF="#sdendnote1147sym"><SUP>mcxlvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, many resting places have been prepared in Kalakhemaka the
Sakyan's dwelling. Many bhikkhus are living there. This is our time
for making robes, venerable sir."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1148anc" HREF="#sdendnote1148sym"><SUP>mcxlviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
"Ananda, a bhikkhu does not shine by delighting in company, by
taking delight in company, by devoting himself to delight in company;
by delighting in society, by taking delight in society, by rejoicing
in society. Indeed, Ananda, it is not possible that a bhikkhu who
delights in company, takes delight in company, and devotes himself to
delight in company, who delights in society, takes delight in
society, and rejoices in society, will ever obtain at will, without
trouble or difficulty, the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of
seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of enlightenment.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1149anc" HREF="#sdendnote1149sym"><SUP>mcxlix</SUP></A></SUP>
But it can be expected that when a bhikkhu lives alone, withdrawn
from society, he will obtain at will, without trouble or difficulty,
the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of
peace, the bliss of enlightenment.</P>
<P  >4.
"Indeed, Ananda, it is not possible that a bhikkhu who delights in
company, takes delight in company, and devotes himself to delight in
company, who delights in society, takes delight in society, and
rejoices in society, will ever enter upon and abide in either the
deliverance of mind that is temporary and delectable or in [the
deliverance of mind] that is perpetual and unshakeable.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1150anc" HREF="#sdendnote1150sym"><SUP>mcl</SUP></A></SUP>
But it can be expected that when a bhikkhu lives alone, withdrawn
from society, he will enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind
that is temporary and delectable or in [the deliverance of mind] that
is perpetual and unshakeable. [111]</P>
<P  >5.
"1 do not see even a single kind of form, Ananda, from the change
and alteration of which there would not arise sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair in one who lusts for it and takes delight in
it.</P>
<P  >6.
"However, Ananda, there is this abiding discovered by the
Tathagata: to enter and abide in voidness internally by giving no
attention to all signs.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1151anc" HREF="#sdendnote1151sym"><SUP>mcli</SUP></A></SUP>
If, while the Tathagata is abiding thus, he is visited by bhikkhus or
bhikkhunis, by men or women lay followers, by kings or kings'
ministers, by other sectarians or their disciples, then with a mind
leaning to seclusion, tending and inclining to seclusion, withdrawn,
delighting in renunciation, and altogether done with things that are
the basis for taints, he invariably talks to them in a way concerned
with dismissing them.</P>
<P  >7.
"Therefore, Ananda, if a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I enter upon
and abide in voidness internally,' he should steady his mind
internally, quiet it, bring it to singleness, and concentrate it. And
how does he steady his mind internally, quiet it, bring it to
singleness, and concentrate it?</P>
<P  >8.
"Here, Ananda, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana … the second jhana … the third jhana … the fourth jhana,
which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity. That is how a bhikkhu steadies his mind internally,
quiets it, brings it to singleness, and concentrates it. [112]</P>
<P  >9.
"Then he gives attention to voidness internally.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1152anc" HREF="#sdendnote1152sym"><SUP>mclii</SUP></A></SUP>
While he is giving attention to voidness internally, his mind does
not enter into voidness internally or acquire confidence, steadiness,
and decision. When that is so, he understands thus: 'While I am
giving attention to voidness internally, my mind does not enter into
voidness internally or acquire confidence, steadiness, and decision.'
In this way he has full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >"He
gives attention to voidness externally … He gives attention to
voidness internally and externally … He gives attention to
imperturbability.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1153anc" HREF="#sdendnote1153sym"><SUP>mcliii</SUP></A></SUP>
While he is giving attention to imperturbability, his mind does not
enter into imperturbability or acquire confidence, steadiness, and
decision. When that is so, he understands thus: 'While I am giving
attention to imperturbability, my mind does not enter into
imperturbability or acquire confidence, steadiness, and decision.'
In this way he has full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >10.
"Then that bhikkhu should steady his mind internally, quiet it,
bring it to singleness, and concentrate it on that same sign of
concentration as before.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1154anc" HREF="#sdendnote1154sym"><SUP>mcliv</SUP></A></SUP>
Then he gives attention to voidness internally. While he is giving
attention to voidness internally, his mind enters into voidness
internally and acquires confidence, steadiness, and decision. When
that is so, he understands thus: 'While I am giving attention to
voidness internally, my mind enters into voidness internally and
acquires confidence, steadiness, and decision.' In this way he has
full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >"He
gives attention to voidness externally … He gives attention to
voidness internally and externally … He gives attention to
imperturbability. While he is giving attention to imperturbability,
his mind enters into imperturbability and acquires confidence,
steadiness, and decision. When that is so, he understands thus:
'While I am giving attention to imperturbability, my mind enters
into imperturbability and acquires confidence, steadiness, and
decision.' In this way he has full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >11.
"When a bhikkhu abides thus, if his mind inclines to walking, he
walks, thinking: 'While I am walking thus, no evil unwholesome
states of covetousness and grief will beset me.' [113] In this way
he has full awareness of that. And when a bhikkhu abides thus, if his
mind inclines to standing, he stands … If his mind inclines to
sitting, he sits … If his mind inclines to lying down, he lies
down, thinking: 'While I am lying down thus, no evil unwholesome
states will beset me.' In this way he has full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >12.
"When a bhikkhu abides thus, if his mind inclines to talking, he
resolves: 'Such talk as is low, vulgar, coarse, ignoble,
unbeneficial, and which does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion,
cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and Nibbana, that
is, talk of kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, battles,
food, drink, clothing, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, vehicles,
villages, towns, cities, countries, women, heroes, streets, wells,
the dead, trivialities, the origin of the world, the origin of the
sea, whether things are so or are not so: such talk I shall not
utter.' In this way he has full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >"But
he resolves: 'Such talk as deals with effacement, as favours the
mind's release, and which leads to complete disenchantment,
dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and
Nibbana, that is, talk on wanting little, on contentment, seclusion,
aloofness from society, arousing energy, virtue, concentration,
wisdom, deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliverance: such talk I
shall utter.' In this way he has full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >13.
"When a bhikkhu abides thus, [114] if his mind inclines to
thinking, he resolves: 'Such thoughts as are low, vulgar, coarse,
ignoble, unbeneficial, and which do not lead to disenchantment,
dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and
Nibbana, that is, thoughts of sensual desire, thoughts of ill will,
and thoughts of cruelty: such thoughts I shall not think.' In this
way he has full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >"But
he resolves: 'Such thoughts as are noble and emancipating, and lead
the one who practises in accordance with them to the complete
destruction of suffering, that is, thoughts of renunciation, thoughts
of non-ill will, and thoughts of noncruelty: such thoughts I shall
think.' In this way he has full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >14.
"Ananda, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1155anc" HREF="#sdendnote1155sym"><SUP>mclv</SUP></A></SUP>
What five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >15.
"Herein a bhikkhu should constantly review his own mind thus: 'Does
any mental excitement concerning these five cords of sensual pleasure
ever arise in me on any occasion?' If, on reviewing his mind, the
bhikkhu understands: 'Mental excitement concerning these five cords
of sensual pleasure does arise in me on certain occasions,' then he
understands: 'Desire and lust for the five cords of sensual
pleasure are unabandoned in me.' In this way he has full awareness
of that. But if, on reviewing his mind, the bhikkhu understands: 'No
mental excitement concerning these five cords of sensual pleasure
arises in me on any occasion,' then he understands: 'Desire and
lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure are abandoned in me.'
In this way he has full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >16.
"Ananda, there are these five aggregates affected by clinging,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1156anc" HREF="#sdendnote1156sym"><SUP>mclvi</SUP></A></SUP>
in regard to which a bhikkhu should abide contemplating rise and fall
thus: 'Such is material form, such its arising, such its
disappearance; such is feeling, such [115] its arising, such its
disappearance; such is perception, such its arising, such its
disappearance; such are formations, such their arising, such their
disappearance; such is consciousness, such its arising, such its
disappearance.'</P>
<P  >17.
"When he abides contemplating rise and fall in these five
aggregates affected by clinging, the conceit 'I am' based on
these five aggregates affected by clinging is abandoned in him. When
that is so, that bhikkhu understands: 'The conceit "I am" based
on these five aggregates affected by clinging is abandoned in me.'
In that way he has full awareness of that.</P>
<P  >18.
"These states have an entirely wholesome basis; they are noble,
supramundane, and inaccessible to the Evil One.</P>
<P  >19.
"What do you think, Ananda? What good does a disciple see that he
should seek the Teacher's company even if he is told to go away?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the
Blessed One, have the Blessed One as their resort.</P>
<P  >It
would be good if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these
words. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will
remember it."</P>
<P  >20.
"Ananda, a disciple should not seek the Teacher's company for the
sake of discourses, stanzas, and expositions. Why is that? For a long
time, Ananda, you have learned the teachings, remembered them,
recited them verbally, examined them with the mind, and penetrated
them well by view. But such talk as deals with effacement, as favours
the mind's release, and which leads to complete disenchantment,
dispassion, cessation, peace, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and
Nibbana, that is, talk on wanting little, on contentment, seclusion,
aloofness from society, arousing energy, virtue, concentration,
wisdom, deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliverance: for the
sake of such talk a disciple should seek the Teacher's company even
if he is told to go away.</P>
<P  >21.
"Since this is so, Ananda, a teacher's undoing may come about, a
pupil's undoing may come about, and the undoing of one who lives
the holy life may come about.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1157anc" HREF="#sdendnote1157sym"><SUP>mclvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >22.
"And how does a teacher's undoing come about? Here some teacher
resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree,
a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, [116] a
jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw. While he lives thus
withdrawn, brahmins and householders from town and country visit him,
and as a result he goes astray, becomes filled with desire, succumbs
to craving, and reverts to luxury. This teacher is said to be undone
by the teacher's undoing. He has been struck down by evil
unwholesome states that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble,
ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death. This
is how the teacher's undoing comes about.</P>
<P  >23.
"And how does a pupil's undoing come about? A pupil of that
teacher, emulating the teacher's seclusion, resorts to a secluded
resting place: the forest … a heap of straw. While he lives thus
withdrawn, brahmins and householders from town and country visit him,
and as a result he goes astray, becomes filled with desire, succumbs
to craving, and reverts to luxury. This pupil is said to be undone by
the pupil's undoing. He has been struck down by evil unwholesome
states that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in
suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death. This is how
the pupil's undoing comes about.</P>
<P  >24.
"And how does the undoing of one who lives the holy life come
about? Here a Tathagata appears in the world, accomplished and fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He resorts to a secluded
resting place: the forest … a heap of straw. While he lives thus
withdrawn, brahmins and householders from town and country visit him,
yet he does not go astray, or become filled with desire, succumb to
craving, and revert to luxury. [117] But a disciple of this teacher,
emulating his teacher's seclusion, resorts to a secluded resting
place: the forest … a heap of straw. While he lives thus withdrawn,
brahmins and householders from town and country visit him, and as a
result he goes astray, becomes filled with desire, succumbs to
craving, and reverts to luxury. This one who lives the holy life is
said to be undone by the undoing of one who lives the holy life. He
has been struck down by evil unwholesome states that defile, bring
renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to
future birth, ageing, and death. Thus there comes to be the undoing
of one who leads the holy life. And herein, Ananda, the undoing of
one who leads the holy life has a more painful result, a more bitter
result, than the teacher's undoing or the pupil's undoing, and it
even leads to perdition.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1158anc" HREF="#sdendnote1158sym"><SUP>mclviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >25.
"Therefore, Ananda, behave towards me with friendliness, not with
hostility. That will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long
time. And how do disciples behave towards the Teacher with hostility,
not with friendliness? Here, Ananda, compassionate and seeking their
welfare, the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of
compassion: 'This is for your welfare, this is for your happiness.'
His disciples do not want to hear or give ear or exert their minds to
understand; they err and turn aside from the Teacher's
Dispensation. Thus do disciples behave towards the 'Teacher with
hostility, not with friendliness.</P>
<P  >26.

"1 shall not treat you as the potter treats the raw damp clay.
Repeatedly restraining you, I shall speak to you, Ananda. Repeatedly
admonishing you, I shall speak to you, Ananda. The sound core will
stand [the test]."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1159anc" HREF="#sdendnote1159sym"><SUP>mclix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
