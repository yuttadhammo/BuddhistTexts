150. Nagaravindeyya Sutta - To the Nagaravindans</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually
arrived at a Kosalan village named Nagaravinda.</P>
<P  >2.
The brahmin householders of Nagaravinda heard: "The recluse Gotama,
the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been
wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus
[291] and has come to Nagaravinda. Now a good report of Master Gotama
has been spread to this effect: 'That Blessed One is accomplished,
fully enlightened ... (as Sutta 4.1, ยง2) ... he reveals a holy life
that is utterly perfect and pure.' Now it is good to see such
arahants."</P>
<P  >3.
Then the brahmin householders of Nagaravinda went to the Blessed One.
Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their hands in
reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one
side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One's
presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at
one side. When they were seated, the Blessed One said to them:</P>
<P  >4.
"Householders, if wanderers of other sects ask you thus:
'Householders, what kind of recluses and brahmins should not be
honoured, respected, revered, and venerated?' you should answer
them thus: 'Those recluses and brahmins who are not rid of lust,
hate, and delusion regarding forms cognizable by the eye, whose minds
are not inwardly peaceful, and who conduct themselves now
righteously, now unrighteously in body, speech, and mind - such
recluses and brahmins should not be honoured, respected, revered, and
venerated. Why is that?</P>
<P  >Because
we ourselves are not rid of lust, hate, and delusion regarding forms
cognizable by the eye, our minds are not inwardly peaceful, and we
conduct ourselves now righteously, now unrighteously in body, speech,
and mind. Since we do not see any higher righteous conduct on the
part of those good recluses and brahmins, they should not be
honoured, respected, revered, and venerated.</P>
<P  >"'Those
recluses and brahmins who are not rid of lust, hate, and delusion
regarding sounds cognizable by the ear ... regarding odours
cognizable by the nose ... regarding flavours cognizable by the
tongue ... regarding tangibles cognizable by the body ... regarding
mind-objects cognizable by the mind, whose minds are not inwardly
peaceful, and who conduct themselves now righteously, now
unrighteously in body, speech, and mind ... should not be honoured ...
[292] ... Since we do not see any higher righteous conduct on the
part of those good recluses and brahmins, they should not be
honoured, respected, revered, and venerated.' Being thus asked,
householders, you should answer those wanderers of other sects in
this way.</P>
<P  >5.
"But, householders, if wanderers of other sects ask you thus:
'Householders, what kind of recluses and brahmins should be
honoured, respected, revered, and venerated?' you should answer
them thus: 'Those recluses and brahmins who are rid of lust, hate,
and delusion regarding forms cognizable by the eye, whose minds are
inwardly peaceful, and who conduct themselves righteously in body,
speech, and mind - such recluses and brahmins should be honoured,
respected, revered, and venerated. Why is that? Because we ourselves
are not rid of lust, hate, and delusion regarding forms cognizable by
the eye, our minds are not inwardly peaceful, and we conduct
ourselves now righteously, now unrighteously, in body, speech, and
mind. Since we see higher righteous conduct on the part of those good
recluses and brahmins, they should be honoured, respected, revered,
and venerated.</P>
<P  >"'Those
recluses and brahmins who are rid of lust, hate, and delusion
regarding sounds cognizable by the ear ... regarding odours
cognizable by the nose ... regarding flavours cognizable by the
tongue ... regarding tangibles cognizable by the body ... regarding
mind-objects cognizable by the mind, whose minds are inwardly
peaceful, and who conduct themselves righteously in body, speech, and
mind ... should be honoured ... Since we see higher righteous conduct
on the part of those good recluses and brahmins, they should be
honoured, respected, revered, and venerated.' Being thus asked,
householders, you should answer those wanderers of other sects in
this way.</P>
<P  >6.
"Householders, if wanderers of other sects ask you thus: 'But
what are your reasons and what is your evidence regarding those
venerable ones whereby you say about them: "Surely these venerable
ones [293] are either rid of lust or are practising for the removal
of lust; they are either rid of hate or are practising for the
removal of hate; they are either rid of delusion or are practising
for the removal of delusion"?' - being asked thus, you should
answer those wanderers of other sects thus: 'It is because those
venerable ones resort to remote jungle-thicket resting places in the
forest. For there are no forms cognizable by the eye there of a kind
that they could look at and delight in. There are no sounds
cognizable by the ear there of a kind that they could listen to and
delight in. There are no odours cognizable by the nose there of a
kind that they could smell and delight in. There are no flavours
cognizable by the tongue there of a kind that they could taste and
delight in. There are no tangibles cognizable by the body there of a
kind that they could touch and delight in. These are our reasons,
friends, this is our evidence whereby we say about those venerable
ones: "Surely these venerable ones are either rid of lust, hate,
and delusion, or are practising for their removal.'"Being thus
asked, householders, you should answer those wanderers of other sects
in this way."</P>
<P  >7.
When this was said, the brahmin householders of Nagaravinda said to
the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master
Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as
though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a
lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms. We go to
Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama accept us as lay followers who
have gone to him for refuge for life."</P>
