85. Bodhirajakumara Sutta - To Prince Bodhi</H2>
<P  >[91]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Bhagga country at Sutinsumaragira in the Bhesaka1a Grove, the
Deer Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a palace named Kokanada had recently been built
for Prince Bodhi, and it had not yet been inhabited by any recluse or
brahmin or any human being at all.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote816anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote816sym"><SUP>dcccxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin student Sanjikaputta thus:
"Come, my dear Sanjikaputta, go to the Blessed One and pay homage
in my name with your head at his feet, and ask whether he is free
from illness and affliction and is healthy, strong, and abiding in
comfort, saying: 'Venerable sir, Prince Bodhi pays homage with his
head at the Blessed One's feet, and he asks whether the Blessed One
is free from illness ... and abiding in comfort.' Then say this:
'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of
bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow's meal from Prince Bodhi.'"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," Sanjikaputta replied, and he went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he sat down at one side and said: "Master Gotama,
Prince Bodhi pays homage with his head at Master Gotama's feet and
asks whether he is free from illness ... and abiding in comfort. And
he says this: 'Let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of
bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow's meal from Prince Bodhi.'"</P>
<P  >4.
The Blessed One consented in silence. Then, knowing that the Blessed
One had consented, Sanjikaputta rose from his seat, went to Prince
Bodhi, and told him what had happened [92], adding: "The recluse
Gotama has consented."</P>
<P  >5.
Then, when the night had ended, Prince Bodhi had good food of various
kinds prepared in his own residence, and he had</P>
<P  >the
Kokanada Palace spread with white cloth down to the last step of the
staircase. Then he addressed the brahmin student Sanjikaputta thus:
"Come, my dear Sanjikaputta, go to the Blessed One and announce
that it is time thus: 'It is time, venerable sir, the meal is
ready.'"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," Sanjikaputta replied, and he went to the Blessed One and
announced that it was time thus: "It is time, Master Gotama, the
meal is ready."</P>
<P  >6.
Then, it being morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl
and outer robe, went to Prince Bodhi's residence.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion Prince Bodhi was standing in the outer porch
waiting for the Blessed One. When he saw the Blessed One coming in
the distance, he went out to meet him and paid homage to him; and
then, allowing the Blessed One to precede him, he proceeded to the
Kokanada Palace. But the Blessed One stopped at the lowest step of
the staircase. Prince Bodhi said to him: "Venerable sir, let the
Blessed One step on the cloth, let the Sublime One step on the cloth,
that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time." When
this was said, the Blessed One was silent.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote817anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote817sym"><SUP>dcccxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >A
second time ... A third time Prince Bodhi said to him: "Venerable
sir, let the Blessed One step on the cloth, let the Sublime One step
on the cloth, that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long
time."</P>
<P  >The
Blessed One looked at the venerable Ananda. [93] The venerable Ananda
said to Prince Bodhi: "Prince, let the cloth be removed. The
Blessed One will not step on a strip of cloth; the Tathagata has
regard for future generations."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote818anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote818sym"><SUP>dcccxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
So Prince Bodhi had the cloth removed, and he had seats prepared in
the upper apartments of the Kokanada Palace. The Blessed One and the
Sangha of bhikkhus ascended the Kokanada Palace and sat down on the
seats that had been prepared.</P>
<P  >9.
Then, with his own hands, Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the
Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of
good food. When the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand
from the bowl, Prince Bodhi took a low seat, sat down at one side,
and said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, we have thought thus:
'Pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure; pleasure is to be
gained through pain."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote819anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote819sym"><SUP>dcccxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >10.
"Prince, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an
unenlightened Bodhisatta, I too thought thus: 'Pleasure is not to
be gained through pleasure; pleasure is to be gained through pain.'</P>
<P  >11-14.
"Later, prince, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed
with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life ... (as Sutta 26,
§§15-17) ... And I sat down there thinking: 'This will serve for
striving.'</P>
<P  >15-42.
"Now three similes occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before
... (as Sutta 36, §§17-44, but in the present sutta in §§18-23 -
corresponding to §§20-25 of Sutta 36 - the sentence "But such
painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain"
does not occur; and in the present sutta in §§37, 39 and 42 -
corresponding to §§39, 41, and 44 of Sutta 36 - the sentence "But
such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and
remain" does not occur) ... as happens in one who abides diligent,
ardent, and resolute.</P>
<P  >43-53.
"I considered: 'This Dhamma that I have attained is profound' ...
(as Sutta 26, §§19-29) [94] ... and the six of us lived on what
those two bhikkhus brought back from their almsround.</P>
<P  >54.
"Then the bhikkhus of the group of five, not long after being thus
taught and instructed by me, by realising for themselves with direct
knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal
of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from
the home life into homelessness."</P>
<P  >55.
When this was said, Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One: "Venerable
sir, when a bhikkhu finds the Tathagata to discipline him, how long
is it until by realising for himself with direct knowledge, he here
and now enters upon and abides in that supreme goal of the holy life
for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life
into homelessness?"</P>
<P  >"As
to that, prince, I shall ask you a question in return. Answer it as
you choose. What do you think, prince? Are you skilled in the art of
wielding a goad while riding an elephant?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir, I am."</P>
<P  >56.
"What do you think, prince? Suppose a man came here thinking:
'Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a goad while riding an
elephant; I shall train in that art under him.' If he had no faith,
he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who has faith; if he
had much illness, he could not achieve what can be achieved. by one
who is free from illness; if he was fraudulent and deceitful, he
could not achieve what can be achieved by one who is honest and
sincere; if he was lazy, he could not achieve what can be achieved by
one who is energetic; if he was not wise, he could not achieve what
can be achieved by one who is wise. What do you think, prince? Could
that man train under you in the art of wielding a goad while riding
an elephant?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, even if he had one of those deficiencies, he could not train
under me, so what of the five?"</P>
<P  >57.
"What do you think, prince? Suppose a man came here thinking: [95]
'Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a goad while riding an
elephant; I shall train in that art under him.' If he had faith, he
could achieve what can be achieved by one who has faith; if he was
free from illness, he could achieve what can be achieved by one who
is free from illness; if he was honest and sincere, he could achieve
what can be achieved by one who is honest and sincere; if he was
energetic, he could achieve what can be achieved by one who is
energetic; if he was wise, he could achieve what can be achieved by
one who is wise. What do you think, prince? Could that man train
under you in the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephant?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, even if he had one of those qualities he could train under me,
so what of the five?"</P>
<P  >58.
"So too, prince, there are these five factors of striving. What
five? Here a bhikkhu has faith, he places his faith in the
Tathagata's enlightenment thus: 'That Blessed One is
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.'</P>
<P  >"Then
he is free from illness and affliction, possessing a good digestion
that is neither too cool nor too warm but medium and able to bear the
strain of striving.</P>
<P  >"Then
he is honest and sincere, and shows himself as he actually is to the
Teacher and his companions in the holy life.</P>
<P  >"Then
he is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking
wholesome states, steadfast, launching his effort with firmness and
persevering in cultivating wholesome states.</P>
<P  >"Then
he is wise; he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that
is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of
suffering. These are the five factors of striving.</P>
<P  >59.
"Prince, when a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors of
striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him, he might dwell seven
years until by realising for himself with direct knowledge, he here
and now enters upon and abides in that supreme goal of the holy life
for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life
into homelessness. [96]</P>
<P  >"Let
alone seven years, prince. When a bhikkhu who possesses these five
factors of striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him, he might
dwell six years ... five years ... four years ... three years ... two
years ... one year ... Let alone one year, prince, ... he might dwell
seven months ... six months ... five months ... four months ... three
months ... two months ... one month ... half a month ... Let alone
half a month, prince, ... he might dwell seven days and nights ...
six days and nights ... five days and nights ... four days and nights
... three days and nights ... two days and nights ... one day and
night.</P>
<P  >"Let
alone one day and night, prince. When a bhikkhu who possesses these
five factors of striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him, then
being instructed in the evening, he might arrive at distinction in
the morning; being instructed in the morning, he might arrive at
distinction in the evening."</P>
<P  >60.
When this was said, Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One: "Oh the
Buddha! Oh the Dhamma! Oh, how well proclaimed is the Dhamma! For one
instructed in the evening might arrive at distinction in the morning,
and one instructed in the morning might arrive at distinction in the
evening."</P>
<P  >61.
When this was said, the brahmin student Sanjikaputta said to Prince
Bodhi: "Master Bodhi says: 'Oh the Buddha! Oh the Dhamma! Oh, how
well proclaimed is the Dhamma!' But he does not say: 'I go to
Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus.'"</P>
<P  >"Do
not say that, my dear Sanjikaputta, do not say that. I heard and
learned this from my mother's lips: [97] There was an occasion when
the Blessed One was living at Kosambi in Ghosita's Park. Then my
mother, who was pregnant, went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, she sat down at one side and said to him: 'Venerable
sir, the prince or princess in my womb, whichever it may be, goes to
the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One remember [the child] as a lay follower
who has gone to him for refuge for life.' There was also an
occasion when the Blessed One was living here in the country of the
Bhaggas at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala Grove, the Deer Park. Then
my nurse, carrying me on her hip, went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, she stood at one side and said to him:
'Venerable sir, this Prince Bodhi goes to the Blessed One for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let the
Blessed One remember him as a lay follower who has gone to him for
refuge for life.' Now, my dear Sanjikaputta, for the third time I
go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha
of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who
has gone to him for refuge for life."</P>
