<P  >[469]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a bhikkhu named Gulissani, a forestdweller of
lax behaviour, had come on a visit to stay in the midst of the Sangha
for some business or other. The venerable Sariputta addressed the
bhikkhus with reference to the bhikkhu Gulissani thus:</P>
<P  >3.
"Friends, when a forest-dwelling bhikkhu comes to the Sangha and is
living in the Sangha, he should be respectful and deferential towards
his companions in the holy life. If he is disrespectful and
undeferential towards his companions in the holy life, there will be
those who would say of him: 'What has this venerable forest-dweller
gained by his dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, since
he is disrespectful and undeferential towards his companions in the
holy life?' Since there would be those who would say this of him, a

<P  >4.
"When a forest-dwelling bhikkhu comes to the Sangha and is living
in. the Sangha, he should be skilled in good behaviour regarding
seats thus: 'I shall sit down in such a way that I do not encroach
upon elder bhikkhus and do not deny new bhikkhus a seat.' If he is
not skilled in good behaviour regarding seats, there will be those
who would say of him: 'What has this venerable forest-dweller
gained by his dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, since
he does not even know what pertains to good behaviour?' Since there

late in the day. If he enters the village too early and returns late
