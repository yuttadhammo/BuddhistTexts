139. Aranavibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of Non-Conflict</H2>
<P  >[230]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthl in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There the Blessed
One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you an exposition of non-conflict. Listen
and attend closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes, venerable sir,”
the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
“One should not pursue sensual pleasure, which is low, vulgar,
coarse, ignoble, and unbeneficial; and one should not pursue
self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial. The
Middle Way discovered by the Tathagata avoids both extremes; giving
vision, giving knowledge, it leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1257anc" HREF="#sdendnote1257sym"><SUP>mcclvii</SUP></A></SUP>
One should know what it is to extol and what it is to disparage, and
knowing both, one should neither extol nor disparage but should teach
only the Dhamma. One should know how to define pleasure, and knowing
that, one should pursue pleasure within oneself. One should not utter
covert speech, and one should not utter overt sharp speech. One
should speak unhurriedly, not hurriedly. One should not insist on
local language, and one should not override normal usage. This is the
summary of the exposition of non-conflict.</P>
<P  >4.
“‘One should not pursue sensual pleasure, which is low, vulgar,
coarse, ignoble, and unbeneficial; and one should not pursue
self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial.’
So it was said. And with reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >“The
pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to sensual
desires<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1258anc" HREF="#sdendnote1258sym"><SUP>mcclviii</SUP></A></SUP>
- low, vulgar, coarse, ignoble, and unbeneficial - is a state beset
by suffering, vexation, despair, and fever, and it is the wrong way.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1259anc" HREF="#sdendnote1259sym"><SUP>mcclix</SUP></A></SUP>
[231] Disengagement from the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose
pleasure is linked to sensual desires - low, vulgar, coarse, ignoble,
and unbeneficial - is a state without suffering, vexation, despair,
and fever, and it is the right way.</P>
<P  >“The
pursuit of self-mortification - painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial -
is a state beset by suffering, vexation, despair, and fever, and it
is the wrong way. Disengagement from the pursuit of
self-mortification - painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial - is a state
without suffering, vexation, despair, and fever, and it is the right
way.</P>
<P  >“So
it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘One should not
pursue sensual pleasure, which is low, vulgar, coarse, ignoble, and
unbeneficial; and one should not pursue self-mortification, which is
painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial.’</P>
<P  >5.
“‘The Middle Way discovered by the Tathagata avoids both these
extremes; giving vision, giving knowledge, it leads to peace, to
direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana.’ So it was said.
And with reference to what was this said? It is just this Noble
Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech,
right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and
right concentration. So it was with reference to this that it was
said: ‘The Middle Way discovered by the Tathagata avoids both these
extremes … to Nibbana.’</P>
<P  >6.
“‘One should know what it is to extol and what it is to
disparage, and knowing both, one should neither extol nor disparage
but should teach only the Dhamma.’ So it was said. And with
reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >7.
“How, bhikkhus, does there come to be extolling and disparaging and
failure to teach only the Dhamma? When one says: ‘All those engaged
in the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to
sensual desires - low … and unbeneficial - are beset by suffering,
vexation, despair, and fever, and they have entered upon the wrong
way,’ one thus disparages some. When one says: ‘All those
disengaged from the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is
linked to sensual desires - low … and unbeneficial - are without
suffering, vexation, despair, and fever, and they have entered upon
the right way,’ one thus extols some.</P>
<P  >“When
one says: ‘All those engaged in the pursuit of selfmortification -
painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial - [232] are beset by suffering,
vexation, despair, and fever, and they have entered upon the wrong
way,’ one thus disparages some. When one says: ‘All those
disengaged from the pursuit of selfmortification - painful, ignoble,
and unbeneficial - are without suffering, vexation, despair, and
fever, and they have entered upon the right way,’ one thus extols
some.</P>
<P  >“When
one says: ‘All those who have not abandoned the fetter of being<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1260anc" HREF="#sdendnote1260sym"><SUP>mcclx</SUP></A></SUP>
are beset by suffering, vexation, despair, and fever, and they have
entered upon the wrong way,’ one thus disparages some. When one
says: ‘All those who have abandoned the fetter of being are without
suffering, vexation, despair, and fever, and they have entered upon
the right way,’ one thus extols some. This is how there comes to be
extolling and disparaging and failure to teach only the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >8.
“And how, bhikkhus, does there come to be neither extolling nor
disparaging but teaching only the Dhamma? When one does not say: ‘All
those engaged in the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure
is linked to sensual desires … have entered upon the wrong way,’
but says instead: ‘The pursuit is a state beset by suffering,
vexation, despair, and fever, and it is the wrong way,’ then one
teaches only the Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1261anc" HREF="#sdendnote1261sym"><SUP>mcclxi</SUP></A></SUP>
When one does not say: ‘All those disengaged from the pursuit of
the enjoyment of one whose pleasure is linked to sensual desires …
have entered upon the right way,’ but says instead: ‘The
disengagement is a state without suffering, vexation, despair, and
fever, and it is the right way,’ then one teaches only the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >“When
one does not say: ‘All those engaged in the pursuit of
self-mortification … have entered upon the wrong way,’ but says
instead: ‘The pursuit is a state beset by suffering, vexation,
despair, and fever, and it is the wrong way,’ then one teaches only
the Dhamma. When one does not say: ‘All those disengaged from the
pursuit of self-mortification … have entered upon the right way,’
but says instead: ‘The disengagement is a state without suffering,
vexation, despair, and fever, and it is the right way,’ then one
teaches only the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >“When
one does not say: ‘All those who have not abandoned the fetter of
being … have entered upon the wrong way,’ [233] but says instead:
‘As long as the fetter of being is unabandoned, being too is
unabandoned,’ then one teaches only the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >When
one does not say: ‘All those who have abandoned the fetter of being
… have entered upon the right way,’ but says instead: ‘When the
fetter of being is abandoned, being also is abandoned,’ then one
teaches only the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >“So
it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘One should know
what it is to extol and what it is to disparage, and knowing both,
one should neither extol nor disparage but should teach only the
Dhamma.’</P>
<P  >9.
“‘One should know how to define pleasure, and knowing that, one
should pursue pleasure within oneself.’ So it was said. And with
reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhus,
there are these five cords of sensual pleasure. What five? Forms
cognizable by the eye … sounds cognizable by the ear … odours
cognizable by the nose … flavours cognizable by the tongue …
tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.
Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of
sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasure - a filthy pleasure, a
coarse pleasure, an ignoble pleasure. I say of this kind of pleasure
that it should not be pursued, that it should not be developed, that
it should not be cultivated, and that it should be feared.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana … the second jhana … the third jhana … the fourth jhana.
This is called the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the
bliss of peace, the bliss of enlightenment. I say of this kind of
pleasure that it should be pursued, that it should be developed, that
it should be cultivated, and that it should not be feared. [234]</P>
<P  >“So
it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘One should know
how to define pleasure, and knowing that, one should pursue pleasure
within oneself.’</P>
<P  >10.
“‘One should not utter covert speech, and one should not utter
overt sharp speech.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was
this said?</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, when one knows covert speech to be untrue, incorrect, and
unbeneficial, one should on no account utter it. When one knows
covert speech to be true, correct, and unbeneficial, one should try
not to utter it. But when one knows covert speech to be true,
correct, and beneficial, one may utter it, knowing the time to do so.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, when one knows overt sharp speech to be untrue, incorrect,
and unbeneficial, one should on no account utter it. When one knows
overt sharp speech to be true, correct, and unbeneficial, one should
try not to utter it. But when one knows overt sharp speech to be
true, correct, and beneficial, one may utter it, knowing the time to
do so.</P>
<P  >“So
it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘One should not
utter covert speech, and one should not utter overt sharp speech.’</P>
<P  >11.
“‘One should speak unhurriedly, not hurriedly.’ So it was said.
And with reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, when one speaks hurriedly, one’s body grows tired and
one’s mind becomes excited, one’s voice is strained and one’s
throat becomes hoarse, and the speech of one who speaks hurriedly is
indistinct and hard to understand.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, when one speaks unhurriedly, one’s body does not grow
tired nor does one’s mind become excited, one’s voice is not
strained nor does one’s throat become hoarse, and the speech of one
who speaks unhurriedly is distinct and easy to understand.</P>
<P  >“So
it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘One should speak
unhurriedly, not hurriedly.’</P>
<P  >12.
“‘One should not insist on local language, and one should not
override normal usage.’ So it was said. And with reference to what
was this said?</P>
<P  >“How,
bhikkhus, does there come to be insistence on local language and
overriding of normal usage? Here, bhikkhus, in different localities
they call the same thing a ‘dish’ [pati], [235] a ‘bowl’
[patta], a ‘vessel’ [vittha], a ‘saucer’ [serava], a ‘pan’
[dharopa], a ‘pot’ [pona], a ‘mug’ [hana] or a ‘basin’
[pisfla]. So whatever they call it in such and such a locality, one
speaks accordingly, firmly adhering [to that expression] and
insisting: ‘Only this is correct; anything else is wrong.’ This
is how there comes to be insistence on local language and overriding
normal usage.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1262anc" HREF="#sdendnote1262sym"><SUP>mcclxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“And
how, bhikkhus, does there come to be non-insistence on local language
and non-overriding of normal usage? Here, bhikkhus, in different
localities they call the same thing a ‘dish’ … or a ‘basin.’
So whatever they call it in such and such a locality, without
adhering [to that expression] one speaks accordingly, thinking:
‘These venerable ones, it seems, are speaking with reference to
this.’ This is how there comes to be noninsistence on local
language and non-overriding of normal usage.</P>
<P  >“So
it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘One should not
insist on local language, and one should not override normal usage.’</P>
<P  >13.
“Here, bhikkhus, the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure
is linked to sensual desires - low … and unbeneficial - is a state
beset by suffering, vexation, despair, and fever, and it is the wrong
way. Therefore this is a state with conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, disengagement from the pursuit of the enjoyment of one
whose pleasure is linked to sensual desires - low … and
unbeneficial - is a state without suffering, vexation, despair, and
fever, and it is the right way. Therefore this is a state without
conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, the pursuit of self-mortification - painful, ignoble, and
unbeneficial - is a state beset by suffering, vexation, despair, and
fever, and it is the wrong way. Therefore this is a state with
conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, disengagement from the pursuit of selfmortification -
painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial - is a state without suffering,
vexation, despair, and fever, and it is the right way. [236]
Therefore this is a state without conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, the Middle Way discovered by the Tathagata avoids both
these extremes; giving vision, giving knowledge, it leads to peace,
to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. It is a state
without suffering … and it is the right way. Therefore this is a
state without conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, extolling and disparaging and failure to teach only the
Dhamma is a state beset by suffering … and it is the wrong way.
Therefore this is a state with conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, not extolling and not disparaging and teaching only the
Dharnma is a state without suffering … and it is the right way.
Therefore this is a state without conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, sensual pleasure - a filthy pleasure, a coarse pleasure, an
ignoble pleasure - is a state beset by suffering … and it is the
wrong way. Therefore this is a state with conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the
bliss of peace, the bliss of enlightenment, is a state</P>
<P  >without
suffering … and it is the right way. Therefore this is a state
without conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, covert speech that is untrue, incorrect, and unbeneficial
is a state beset by suffering … Therefore this is a state with
conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, covert speech that is true, correct, and unbeneficial is a
state beset by suffering … Therefore this is a state with conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, covert speech that is true, correct, and beneficial is a
state without suffering … Therefore this is a state without
conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, overt sharp speech that is untrue, incorrect, and
unbeneficial is a state beset by suffering … Therefore this is a
state with conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, overt sharp speech that is true, correct, and unbeneficial
is a state beset by suffering … Therefore this is a state with
conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, overt sharp speech [237] that is true, correct, and
beneficial is a state without suffering … Therefore this is a state
without conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, the speech of one who speaks hurriedly is a state beset by
suffering, vexation, despair, and fever, and it is the wrong way.
Therefore this is a state with conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, the speech of one who speaks unhurriedly is a state without
suffering … Therefore this is a state without conflict.</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhus, insistence on local language and overriding of normal usage
is a state beset by suffering … Therefore this is a state with

<P  >14.
“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We shall
know the state with conflict and we shall know the state without
conflict, and knowing these, we shall enter upon the way without
conflict.’ Now, bhikkhus, Subhuti is a clansman who has entered
upon the way without conflict.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1263anc" HREF="#sdendnote1263sym"><SUP>mcclxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
