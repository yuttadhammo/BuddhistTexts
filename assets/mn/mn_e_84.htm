84. Madhura Sutta - At Madhura</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Maha Kaccana was
living at Madhura in the Gunda Grove.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote814anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote814sym"><SUP>dcccxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
King Avantiputta of Madhura heard: "The recluse Kaccana is living
at Madhura in the Gunda Grove. Now a good report of Master Kaccana
has been spread to this effect: 'He is wise, discerning, sagacious,
learned, articulate, and perspicacious; he is aged and he is an
arahant. It is good to see such arahants.'"</P>
<P  >3.
Then King Avantiputta of Madhura had a number of state carriages made
ready, and mounting a state carriage, he drove out from Madhura with
the full pomp of royalty in order to see the venerable Maha Kaccana.
He went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages, and then
he got down from his carriage and went forward on foot to the
venerable Maha Kaccana. [84] He exchanged greetings with him, and
when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and said:</P>
<P  >4.
"Master Kaccana, the brahmins say thus: 'Brahmins are the highest
caste, those of any other caste are inferior; brahmins are the
fairest caste, those of any other caste are dark; only brahmins are
purified, not non-brahmins; brahmins alone are the sons of Brahma,
the offspring of Brahma, born of his mouth, born of Brahma, created
by Brahma, heirs of Brahma.' What does Master Kaccana say about
that?"</P>
<P  >5.
"It is just a saying in the world, great king, that 'Brahmins are
the highest caste ... heirs of Brahma.' And there is a way whereby
it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a
saying in the world.</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, great king? If a noble prospers in wealth, grain,
silver, or gold, will there be nobles who rise before him and retire
after him, who are eager to serve him, who seek to please him and
speak sweetly to him, and will there also be brahmins, merchants, and
workers who do likewise?"</P>
<P  >"There
will be, Master Kaccana."</P>

<P  >"There
will be, Master Kaccana."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, great king? If that is so, then are these four castes
all the same, or are they not, or how does it appear to you in this
case?" [86]</P>
<P  >"Surely
if that is so, Master Kaccana, then these four castes are all the
same: there is no difference between them at all that I see."</P>
<P  >"That
is a way, great king, whereby it can be understood how that statement
of the brahmins is just a saying in the world.</P>
<P  >6.
"What do you think, great king? Suppose a noble were to kill living
beings, take what is not given, misconduct himself in sensual
pleasures, speak falsely, speak maliciously, speak harshly, gossip,
be covetous, have a mind of ill will, and hold wrong view. On the
dissolution of the body, after death, would he [be likely to]
reappear in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in
perdition, even in hell, or not, or how does it appear to you in this
case?"</P>
<P  >"If
a noble were such, Master Kaccana, he would [be likely to] reappear
in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition,
even in hell. That is how it appears to me in this case, and thus I
have heard from the arahants."</P>
<P  >"What

misconduct in sensual pleasures, from false speech, from malicious

uncovetous, to have a mind without ill will, and to hold right view.

"What do you think, great king? Suppose a noble were to break into
houses, plunder wealth, commit burglary, ambush highways, or seduce
another's wife, and if your men arrested him and produced him,
saying: 'Sire, this is the culprit; command what punishment for him
you wish,' how would you treat him?"</P>
<P  >"We
would have him executed, Master Kaccana, or we would have him fined,
or we would have him exiled, or we would do with him as he deserved.
Why is that? Because he has lost his former status of a noble, and is
simply reckoned as a robber."</P>

"What do you think, great king? Suppose a noble, having shaved off
his hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and gone forth from the
home life into homelessness, were to abstain from killing living
beings, from taking what is not given, and from false speech.
Refraining from eating at night, he would eat only in one part of the
day, and would be celibate, virtuous, of good character. How would
you treat him?"</P>
<P  >"We
would pay homage to him, Master Kaccana, or we would rise up for him,
or invite him to be seated; or we would invite him to accept robes,
almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites; or we would
arrange for him lawful guarding, defence, and protection. Why is
that? Because he has lost his former status of a noble, and is simply
reckoned as a recluse."</P>

When this was said, King Avantiputta of Madhura said to the venerable
Maha Kaccana: "Magnificent, Master Kaccana! Magnificent, Master
Kaccana! Master Kaccana has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as
though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who is lost, or holding up a
lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master
Kaccana for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus.
From today let Master Kaccana remember me as a lay follower who has
gone to him for refuge for life."</P>
<P  >"Do
not go to me for refuge, great king. Go for refuge to that same
Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge."</P>
<P  >"Where
is he living now, that Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened, Master Kaccana?"</P>
<P  >"That
Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, has attained to
final Nibbana, great king."</P>
<P  >11.
"If we heard that that Blessed One was within ten leagues, we would
go ten leagues in order to see that Blessed One, accomplished and
fully enlightened. If we heard that that Blessed One was within
twenty leagues ... thirty leagues ... forty leagues ... fifty leagues
... a hundred leagues, we would go a hundred leagues in order to see
that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened. But since that
Blessed One has attained to final Nibbana, we go to that Blessed One
for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From
today let Master Kaccana remember me as a lay follower who has gone
for refuge for life."</P>
