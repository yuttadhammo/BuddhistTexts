25. Nivapa Sutta - The Bait</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, a deer-trapper does not lay down bait for a deer herd
intending thus: 'May the deer herd enjoy this bait that I have laid
down and so be long-lived and handsome and endure for a long time.'
A deer-trapper lays down bait for a deer herd intending thus: 'The
deer herd will eat food unwarily by going right in amongst the bait
that I have laid down; by so doing they will become intoxicated; when
they are intoxicated, they will fall into negligence; when they are
negligent, I can do with them as I like on account of this bait.'</P>
<P  >3.
"Now the deer of the first herd ate food unwarily by going right in
amongst the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down; by so doing
they became intoxicated; when they were intoxicated, they fell into
negligence; when they were negligent, the deertrapper did with them
as he liked on account of that bait. That is how the deer of the
first herd failed to get free from the deertrapper's power and
control.</P>
<P  >4.
"Now the deer of a second herd reckoned thus: 'The deer of that
first herd, by acting as they did without precaution, [152] failed to
get free from the deer-trapper's power and control. Suppose we
altogether shun that bait food; shunning that fearful enjoyment, let
us go out into the forest wilds and live there.' And they did so.
But in the last month of the hot season when the grass and the water
were used up, their bodies were reduced to extreme emaciation; with
that they lost their strength and energy; when they had lost their
strength and energy, they returned to that same bait that the
deer-trapper had laid down.</P>
<P  >They
ate food unwarily by going right in amongst it. By so doing they
became intoxicated; when they were intoxicated they fell into
negligence; when they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them
as he liked on account of that bait. And that is how the deer of the
second herd also failed to get free from the deer-trapper's power
and control.</P>
<P  >5.
"Now the deer of a third herd reckoned thus: 'The deer of that
first herd, by acting as they did without precaution, failed to get
free from the deer-trapper's power and control. The deer of that
second herd, by reckoning how the deer of the first herd had failed
and by planning and acting as they did with the precaution of going
to live in the forest wilds, also failed to get free from the
deer-trapper's power and control. Suppose we make our dwelling
place within range of the deer-trapper's bait. [153] Then, having
done so, we shall eat food not unwarily and without going right in
amongst the bait that the deer-trapper has laid down; by doing so we
shall not become intoxicated; when we are not intoxicated, we shall
not fall into negligence; when we are not negligent, the deer-trapper
shall not do with us as he likes on account of that bait.' And they
did so.</P>
<P  >"But
then the deer-trapper and his following considered thus: 'These
deer of this third herd are as cunning and crafty as wizards and
sorcerers. They eat the bait laid down without our knowing how they
come and go. Suppose we have the bait that is laid down completely
surrounded all round over a wide area with wicker hurdles; then
perhaps we might see the third deer herd's dwelling place, where
they go to hide.' They did so, and they saw the third herd's
dwelling place, where they went to hide. And that is how the deer of
the third herd also failed to get free from the deer-trapper's
power and control.</P>
<P  >6.
"Now the deer of a fourth herd reckoned thus: 'The deer of that
first herd, by acting as they did without precaution, failed to get
free from the deer-trapper's power and control. The deer of that
second herd, by reckoning how the deer of the first herd had failed
and by planning and acting as they did with the precaution of going
to live in the forest wilds, also failed to get free from the
deer-trapper's power and control. And the deer of that third herd,
by reckoning how the deer of the first herd [154] and also the deer
of the second herd had failed, and by planning and acting as they did
with the precaution of making their dwelling place within range of
the deer-trapper's bait, also failed to get free from the
deer-trapper's power and control. Suppose we make our dwelling
place where the deer-trapper and his following cannot go. Then,
having done so, we shall eat food not unwarily and without going
right in amongst the bait that the deer-trapper has laid down; by
doing so we shall not become intoxicated; when we are not
intoxicated, we shall not fall into negligence; when we are not
negligent, [155] the deer-trapper shall not do with us as he likes on
account of that bait.' And they did so.</P>
<P  >"But
then the deer-trapper and his following considered thus: 'These
deer of this fourth herd are as cunning and crafty as wizards and
sorcerers. They eat the bait laid down without our knowing how they
come and go. Suppose we have the bait that is laid down completely
surrounded all round over a wide area with wicker hurdles; then
perhaps we might see the fourth deer herd's dwelling place, where
they go to hide.' They did so, but they did not see the fourth deer
herd's dwelling place, where they went to hide. Then the
deer-hunter and his following considered thus: 'If we scare the
fourth deer herd, being scared they will alert others, and so the
deer herds will all desert this bait that we have laid down. Suppose
we treat the fourth deer herd with indifference.' They did so. And
that was how the deer of the fourth deer herd got free from the
deer-trapper's power and control.</P>
<P  >7.
"Bhikkhus, I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning.
This is the meaning: 'Bait' is a term for the five cords of
sensual pleasure. 'Deer-trapper' is a term for Mara the Evil One.
'The deer-trapper's following' is a term for Mara's
following. 'Deer herd' is a term for recluses and brahmins.</P>
<P  >8.
"Now recluses and brahmins of the first kind ate food unwarily by
going right in amongst the bait and the material things of the world
that Mara had laid down; [156] by so doing they became intoxicated;
when they were intoxicated, they fell into negligence; when they were
negligent, Mara did with them as he liked on account of that bait and
those material things of the world. That is how the recluses and
brahmins of the first kind failed to get free from Mara's power and
control. Those recluses and brahmins, I say, are just like the deer
of the first herd.</P>
<P  >9.
"Now recluses and brahmins of the second kind reckoned thus: 'Those
recluses and brahmins of the first kind, by acting as they did
without precaution, failed to get free from Mara's</P>
<P  >power
and control. Suppose we altogether shun that bait food and those
material things of the world; shunning that fearful enjoyment, let us
go out into the forest wilds and live there.' And they did so.
There they were eaters of greens or millet or wild rice or
hide-parings or moss or rice-bran or the discarded scum of boiled
rice or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung; they lived on forest roots
and fruits, they fed on fallen fruits.</P>
<P  >"But
in the last month of the hot season when the grass and the water were
used up, their bodies were reduced to extreme emaciation; with that
they lost their strength and energy; when they had lost their
strength and energy, they lost their deliverance of mind;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote293anc" HREF="#sdendnote293sym"><SUP>ccxciii</SUP></A></SUP>
with the loss of their deliverance of mind, they returned to that
same bait that Mara had laid down and those material things of the
world; they ate food unwarily by going right in amongst it; by so
doing they became intoxicated; when they were intoxicated, they fell
into negligence; when they were negligent, Mara did with them as he
liked on account of that bait and those material things of the world.
That is how those recluses and brahmins of the second kind failed to
get free from Mara's power and control. [157] Those recluses and
brahmins, I say, are just like the deer of the second herd.</P>
<P  >10.
"Now recluses and brahmins of the third kind reckoned thus: 'Those
recluses and brahmins of the first kind, by acting as they did
without precaution, failed to get free from Mara's power and
control. Those recluses and brahmins of the second kind, by reckoning
how the recluses and brahmins of the first kind had failed, and then
planning and acting as they did with the precaution of going to live
in the forest wilds, also failed to get free from Mara's power and
control. Suppose we make our dwelling place within range of that bait
that Mara has laid down and those material things of the world. Then,
having done so, we shall eat food not unwarily and without going
right in amongst the bait that Mara has laid down and the material
things of the world. By doing so we shall not become intoxicated;
when we are not intoxicated, we shall not fall into negligence; when
we are not negligent, Mara shall not do with us as he likes on
account of that bait and those material things of the world.' And
they did so.</P>
<P  >"But
then they came to hold views such as 'the world is eternal' and
'the world is not eternal' and 'the world is finite' and 'the
world is infinite' and 'the soul and the body are the same' and
'the soul is one thing and the body another' and 'after death a
Tathagata exists' and 'after death a Tathagata does not exist'
and 'after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist' and
'after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote294anc" HREF="#sdendnote294sym"><SUP>ccxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
[158] That is how those recluses and brahmins of the third kind
failed to get free from Mara's power and control. Those recluses
and brahmins, I say, are just like the deer of the third herd.</P>
<P  >11.
"Now recluses and brahmins of the fourth kind reckoned thus: 'Those
recluses and brahmins of the first kind, by acting as they did
without precaution, failed to get free from Mara's power and
control. Those recluses and brahmins of the second kind, by reckoning
how the recluses and brahmins of the first kind had failed, and by
planning and acting as they did with the precaution of going to live
in the forest wilds, also failed to get free from Mara's power and
control. And the recluses and brahmins of the third kind, by
reckoning how the recluses and brahmins of the first kind and also
the recluses and brahmins of the second kind had failed, and by
planning and acting as they did with the precaution of making their
dwelling place within range of the bait that Mara had laid down and
the material things of the world, also failed to get free from Mara's
power and control. Suppose we make our dwelling place where Mara and
his following cannot go. Then, having done so, we shall eat food not
unwarily and without going right in amongst the bait that Mara has
laid down and the material things of the world. By doing so we shall
not become intoxicated; when we are not intoxicated, we shall not
fall into negligence; when we are not negligent, Mara shall not do
with us as he likes on account of that bait and those material things
of the world.' And they did so. [159] And that is how those
recluses and brahmins of the fourth kind got free from Mara's power
and control. Those recluses and brahmins, I say, are just like the
deer of the fourth herd.</P>
<P  >12.
"And where is it that Mara and his following cannot go? Here, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion. This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded
Mara, to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving Mara's
eye of its opportunity.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote295anc" HREF="#sdendnote295sym"><SUP>ccxcv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
"Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkh.u enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has
self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. This
bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara …</P>
<P  >14.
"Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu abides
in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure
with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on
account of which the noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant
abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.' This bhikkhu is said to
have blindfolded Mara …</P>
<P  >15.
"Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana, which has neitherpain-nor-pleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. This bhikkhu is said to have
blindfolded Mara …</P>
<P  >16.
"Again, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with
the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is
infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite
space. This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded Mara …</P>
<P  >17.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware
that 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the base of infinite consciousness. This bhikkhu is said to
have blindfolded Mara …</P>
<P  >18.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, [160] aware that 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu
enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness. This bhikkhu is
said to have blindfolded Mara …</P>
<P  >19.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of
neitherperception-nor-non-perception. This bhikkhu is said to have
blindfolded Mara, to have become invisible to the Evil One by
depriving Mara's eye of its opportunity.</P>
<P  >20.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of
neitherperception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the cessation of perception and feeling. And his taints are
destroyed by his seeing with wisdom. This bhikkhu is said</P>
<P  >to
have blindfolded Mara, to have become invisible to the Evil One by
depriving Mara's eye of its opportunity, and to have crossed beyond
attachment to the world."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote296anc" HREF="#sdendnote296sym"><SUP>ccxcvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
