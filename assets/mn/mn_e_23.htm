23. Vammika Sutta - The Ant-hill</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Now on that
occasion the venerable Kumara Kassapa was living in the Blind Men's
Grove.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote275anc" HREF="#sdendnote275sym"><SUP>cclxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Then,
when the night was well advanced, a certain deity of beautiful
appearance who illuminated the whole of the Blind Men's Grove
approached the venerable Kumara Kassapa and stood at one side.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote276anc" HREF="#sdendnote276sym"><SUP>cclxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
So standing, the deity said to him:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhu, bhikkhu, this ant-hill fumes by night and flames by day.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote277anc" HREF="#sdendnote277sym"><SUP>cclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Thus
spoke the brahmin: 'Delve with the knife, thou wise one.' Delving
with the knife, the wise one saw a bar: 'A bar, O venerable sir.'</P>
<P  >"Thus
spoke the brahmin: 'Throw out the bar; delve with the knife, thou
wise one.' Delving with the knife, the wise one saw a toad: 'A
toad, O venerable sir.'</P>
<P  >"Thus
spoke the brahmin: 'Throw out the toad; delve with the knife, thou
wise one.' Delving with the knife, the wise one saw a fork: 'A
fork, O venerable sir.'</P>
<P  >"Those
spoke the brahmin: 'Throw out the fork; delve with the knife, thou
wise one.' Delving with the knife, the wise one saw a sieve: 'A
sieve, O venerable sir.'</P>
<P  >"Thus
spoke the brahmin: [143] 'Throw out the sieve; delve with the
knife, thou wise one.' Delving with the knife, the wise one saw a
tortoise: 'A tortoise, O venerable sir.'</P>
<P  >"Thus
spoke the brahmin: 'Throw out the tortoise; delve with the knife,
thou wise one.' Delving with the knife, the wise one saw an axe and
block: 'An axe and block, O venerable sir.'</P>
<P  >"Thus
spoke the brahmin: 'Throw out the axe and block; delve with the
knife, thou wise one.' Delving with the knife, the wise one saw a
piece of meat: 'A piece of meat, O venerable sir.'</P>
<P  >"Thus
spoke the brahmin: 'Throw out the piece of meat; delve with the
knife, thou wise one.' Delving with the knife, the wise one saw a
Naga serpent: 'A Naga serpent, O venerable sir.'</P>
<P  >"Thus
spoke the brahmin: 'Leave the Naga serpent; do not harm the Naga
serpent; honour the Naga serpent.'</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
you should go to the Blessed One and ask him about this riddle. As
the Blessed One tells you, so should you remember it. Bhikkhu, other
than the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata or one who has
learned it from them, I see no one in this world with its gods, its
Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and
brahmins, its princes and its people, whose explanation of this
riddle might satisfy the mind."</P>
<P  >That
is what was said by the deity, who thereupon vanished at once.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when the night was over, the venerable Kumara Kassapa went to
the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side
and told the Blessed One what had occurred. Then he asked: "Venerable
sir, what is the ant-hill, what the fuming by night, what the flaming
by day? Who is the brahmin, who the wise one? What is the knife, what
the delving, what the bar, what the toad, what the fork, what the
sieve, what the tortoise, what the axe and block, what the piece of
meat, what the Naga serpent?" [144]</P>
<P  >4.
"Bhikkhu, the ant-hill is a symbol for this body, made of material
form, consisting of the four great elements, procreated by a mother
and father, built up out of boiled rice and porridge,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote278anc" HREF="#sdendnote278sym"><SUP>cclxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
and subject to impermanence, to being worn and rubbed away, to
dissolution and disintegration.</P>
<P  >"What
one thinks and ponders by night based upon one's actions during the
day is the 'fuming by night.'</P>
<P  >"The
actions one undertakes during the day by body, speech, and mind after
thinking and pondering by night is the 'flaming by day.'</P>
<P  >"The
brahmin is a symbol for the Tathagata, accomplished and fully
enlightened. The wise one is a symbol for a bhikkhu in higher
training. The knife is a symbol for noble wisdom. The delving is a
symbol for the arousing of energy.</P>
<P  >"The
bar is a symbol for ignorance.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote279anc" HREF="#sdendnote279sym"><SUP>cclxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
'Throw out the bar: abandon ignorance. Delve with the knife, thou
wise one.' This is the meaning.</P>
<P  >"The
toad is a symbol for the despair due to anger. 'Throw out the toad:
abandon despair due to anger. Delve with the knife, thou wise one.'
This is the meaning.</P>
<P  >"The
fork is a symbol for doubt.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote280anc" HREF="#sdendnote280sym"><SUP>cclxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
'Throw out the fork: abandon doubt. Delve with the knife, thou wise
one.' This is the meaning.</P>
<P  >"The
sieve is a symbol for the five hindrances, namely, the hindrance of
sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the hindrance of sloth and
torpor, the hindrance of restlessness and remorse, and the hindrance
of doubt. 'Throw out the sieve: abandon the five hindrances. Delve
with the knife, thou wise one.' This is the meaning.</P>
<P  >"The
tortoise is a symbol for the five aggregates affected by clinging,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote281anc" HREF="#sdendnote281sym"><SUP>cclxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
namely, the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling
aggregate affected by clinging, the perception aggregate affected by
clinging, the formations aggregate affected by clinging, and the
consciousness aggregate affected by clinging. 'Throw out the
tortoise: abandon the five aggregates affected by clinging. Delve
with the knife, thou wise one.' This is the meaning.</P>
<P  >"The
axe and block is a symbol for the five cords of sensual pleasure<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote282anc" HREF="#sdendnote282sym"><SUP>cclxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
- forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and
provocative of lust; sounds cognizable by the ear … odours
cognizable by the nose … flavours cognizable by the tongue …
tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire, [145] and
provocative of lust. 'Throw out the axe and block: abandon the five
cords of sensual pleasure. Delve with the knife, thou wise one.'
This is the meaning.</P>
<P  >"The
piece of meat is a symbol for delight and lust.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote283anc" HREF="#sdendnote283sym"><SUP>cclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
'Throw out the piece of meat: abandon delight and lust. Delve with
the knife, thou wise one.' This is the meaning.</P>
<P  >"The
Naga serpent is a symbol for a bhikkhu who has destroyed the taints.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote284anc" HREF="#sdendnote284sym"><SUP>cclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
'Leave the Naga serpent; do not harm the Naga serpent; honour the
Naga serpent.' This is the meaning."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Kumara Kassapa was
satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
