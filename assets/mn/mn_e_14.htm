14. Culadukkhakkhandha Sutta - The Shorter Discourse<BR>on the Mass
of Suffering</H2>
<P  >[91]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Mahanama the Sakyan<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote205anc" HREF="#sdendnote205sym"><SUP>ccv</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down
at one side and said: “Venerable sir, I have long understood the
Dhamma taught by the Blessed One thus: ‘Greed is an imperfection
that defiles the mind, hate is an imperfection that defiles the mind,
delusion is an imperfection that defiles the mind.’ Yet while I
understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One thus, at times states
of greed, hate, and delusion invade my mind and remain. I have
wondered, venerable sir, what state is still unabandoned by me
internally, owing to which at times these states of greed, hate, and
delusion invade my mind and remain.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote206anc" HREF="#sdendnote206sym"><SUP>ccvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
“Mahanama, there is still a state unabandoned by you internally,
owing to which at times states of greed, hate, and delusion invade
your mind and remain; for were that state already abandoned by you
internally you would not be living the home life, you would not be
enjoying sensual pleasures.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote207anc" HREF="#sdendnote207sym"><SUP>ccvii</SUP></A></SUP>
It is because that state is unabandoned by you internally that you
are living the home life and enjoying sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >4.
“Even though a noble disciple has seen clearly as it actually is
with proper wisdom how sensual pleasures provide little
gratification, much suffering, and much despair, and how great is the
danger in them, as long as he still does not attain to the rapture
and pleasure that are apart from sensual pleasures, apart from
unwholesome states, or to something more peaceful than that, he may
still be attracted to sensual pleasures.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote208anc" HREF="#sdendnote208sym"><SUP>ccviii</SUP></A></SUP>
But when a noble disciple has seen clearly as it actually is with
proper wisdom how sensual pleasures provide little gratification,
much suffering, and much despair, and how great is the danger in
them, and he attains to the rapture and pleasure that are apart from
sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, or to something
more peaceful than that, then he is no longer attracted to sensual
pleasures. [92]</P>
<P  >5.
“Before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened
Bodhisatta, I too clearly saw as it actually is with proper wisdom
how sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering,
and much despair, and how great is the danger in them, but as long as
I still did not attain to the rapture and pleasure that are apart
from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, or to
something more peaceful than that, I recognised that I still could be
attracted to sensual pleasures. But when I clearly saw as it actually
is with proper wisdom how sensual pleasures provide little
gratification, much suffering, and much despair, and how great is the
danger in them, and I attained to the rapture and pleasure that are
apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, or to
something more peaceful than that, I recognised that I was no longer
attracted to sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >6-14.
“And what is the gratification in the case of sensual pleasures?
Mahanama, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure … (as
Sutta 13, §§7-15) … Now this too is a danger in the case of
sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering in the life to come, having
sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its source,
sensual pleasures as its basis, the cause being simply sensual
pleasures.</P>
<P  >15.
“Now, Mahanama, on one occasion I was living at Rajagaha on the
mountain Vulture Peak. On that occasion a number of Niganthas living
on the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili were practising continuous
standing, rejecting seats, and were experiencing painful, racking,
piercing feelings due to exertion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote209anc" HREF="#sdendnote209sym"><SUP>ccix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >16.
“Then, when it was evening, I rose from meditation and went to the
Niganthas there. I asked them: ‘Friends, why do you practise
continuous standing, rejecting seats, and experience painful,
racking, piercing feelings due to exertion?’</P>
<P  >17.
“When this was said, they replied: ‘Friend, the Nigantha
Nataputta is omniscient and all-seeing and claims to have complete
knowledge and vision thus: “Whether I am walking or standing or
asleep or awake, [93] knowledge and vision are continuously and
uninterruptedly present to me.” He says thus: “Niganthas, you
have done evil actions in the past; exhaust them with the performance
of piercing austerities. And when you are here and now restrained in
body, speech, and mind, that is doing no evil actions for the future.
So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh
actions, there will be no consequence in the future. With no
consequence in the future, there is the destruction of action. With
the destruction of action, there is the destruction of suffering.
With the destruction of suffering, there is the destruction of
feeling. With the destruction of feeling, all suffering will be
exhausted.” This is [the doctrine] we approve of and accept, and we
are satisfied with it.’</P>
<P  >18.
“When this was said, I told them: ‘But, friends, do you know that
you existed in the past, and that it is not the case that you did not
exist?’ - ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But, friends, do you know that you
did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them?’ - ‘No,
friend.’ - ‘But, friends, do you know that you did such and such
evil actions?’ - ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But, friends, do you know
that so much suffering has already been exhausted, or that so much
suffering has still to be exhausted, or that when so much suffering
has been exhausted all suffering will have been exhausted?’ - ‘No,
friend.’ - ‘But, friends, do you know what the abandoning of
unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is
here and now?’ -’No, friend.’</P>
<P  >19.
“‘So, friends, it seems that you do not know that you existed in
the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist; or that
you did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them; or
that you did such and such evil actions; or that so much suffering
has already been exhausted, or that so much suffering has still to be
exhausted, or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all
suffering will have been exhausted; or what the abandoning of
unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is
here and now. That being so, those who are murderers, bloody-handed
evil-doers in the world, when they are reborn among human beings, go
forth into homelessness as Niganthas.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote210anc" HREF="#sdendnote210sym"><SUP>ccx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >20.
“‘Friend Gotama, pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure;
pleasure is to be gained through pain. [94] For were pleasure to be
gained through pleasure, then King Seniya</P>
<P  >Bimbisara
of Magadha would gain pleasure, since he abides in greater pleasure
than the venerable Gotama.’</P>
<P  >“‘Surely
the venerable Niganthas have uttered those words rashly and without
reflection. Rather it is I who ought to be asked: “Who abides in
greater pleasure, King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or the venerable
Gotama?’“</P>
<P  >“‘Surely,
friend Gotama, we uttered those words rashly and without reflection.
But let that be. Now we ask the venerable Gotama: Who abides in
greater pleasure, King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or the venerable
Gotama?’</P>
<P  >21.
“‘Then, friends, I shall ask you a question in return. Answer it
as you like. What do you think, friends? Can King Seniya Bimbisara of
Magadha abide without moving his body or uttering a word,
experiencing the peak of pleasure for seven days and nights?’ -
‘No, friend.’ - ‘Can King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha abide
without moving his body or uttering a word, experiencing the peak of
pleasure for six, five, four, three, or two days and nights? … for
one day and night?’ -’No, friend.’</P>
<P  >22.
“‘But, friends, I can abide without moving my body or uttering a
word, experiencing the peak of pleasure for one day and night … for
two, three, four, five, and six days and nights … for seven days
and nights.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote211anc" HREF="#sdendnote211sym"><SUP>ccxi</SUP></A></SUP>
What do you think, friends? That being so, who dwells in greater
pleasure, King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or I?’</P>
<P  >“‘That
being so, [95] the venerable Gotama abides in greater pleasure than
King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha.’“</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. Mahanama the Sakyan was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
