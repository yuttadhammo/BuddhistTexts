48. Kosambiya Sutta - The Kosambians</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Kosambi in Ghosita's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the bhikkhus at Kosambi had taken to quarrelling
and brawling and were deep in disputes, stabbing each other with
verbal daggers. They could neither convince each other nor be
convinced by others; they could neither persuade each other nor be
persuaded by others.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote491anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote491sym"><SUP>cdxci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then [321] a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and informed him of
what was happening.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: "Come,
bhikkhu, tell those bhikkhus in my name that the Teacher calls them."
- "Yes, venerable sir," he replied, and he went to those bhikkhus
and told them: "The Teacher calls the venerable ones."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
friend," they replied, and they went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, they sat down at one side. The Blessed One then
asked them: "Bhikkhus, is it true that you have taken to
quarrelling and brawling and are deep in disputes, stabbing each
other with verbal daggers; that you can neither convince each other
nor be convinced by others, that you can neither persuade each other
nor be persuaded by others?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir."</P>
<P  >5.
"Bhikkhus, what do you think? When you take to quarrelling and
brawling and are deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal
daggers, do you on that occasion maintain acts of loving-kindness by
body, speech, and mind in public and in private towards your
companions in the holy life?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"So,
bhikkhus, when you take to quarrelling and brawling and are deep in
disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers, on that occasion
you do not maintain acts of loving-kindness by body, speech, and mind
in public and in private towards your companions in the holy life.
Misguided men, what can you possibly know, what can you see, that you
take to quarrelling and brawling and are deep in disputes, [322]
stabbing each other with verbal daggers? That you can neither
convince each other nor be convinced by others, that you can neither
persuade each other nor be persuaded by others? Misguided men, that
will lead to your harm and suffering for a long time."</P>
<P  >6.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, there
are these six memorable qualities that create love and respect and
conduce to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.
What are the six?</P>
<P  >"Here
a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of loving-kindness both in public and
in private towards his companions in the holy life. This is a
memorable quality that creates love and respect, and conduces to
helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.</P>
<P  >"Again,
a bhikkhu maintains verbal acts of loving-kindness both in public and
in private towards his companions in the holy life. This is a
memorable quality that creates love and respect, and conduces to ...
unity.</P>
<P  >"Again,
a bhikkhu maintains mental acts of loving-kindness both in public and
in private towards his companions in the holy life. This is a
memorable quality that creates love and respect, and conduces to ...
unity.</P>
<P  >"Again,
a bhikkhu uses things in common with his virtuous companions in the
holy life; without making reservations, he shares with them any gain
of a kind that accords with the Dhamma and has been obtained in a way
that accords with the Dhamma, including even the contents of his
bowl. This is a memorable quality that creates love and respect, and
conduces to ... unity.</P>
<P  >"Again,
a bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private possessing in common
with his companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken,
untorn, unblotched, unmottled, liberating, commended by the wise, not
misapprehended, and conducive to concentration. This too is a
memorable quality that creates love and respect, and conduces to ...
unity.</P>
<P  >"Again,
a bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private possessing in common
with his companions in the holy life that view that is noble and
emancipating, and leads one who practises in accordance with it to
the complete destruction of suffering.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote492anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote492sym"><SUP>cdxcii</SUP></A></SUP>
This too is a memorable quality that creates love and respect, and
conduces to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.</P>
<P  >"These
are the six memorable qualities that create love and respect, and
conduce to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.</P>
<P  >7.
"Of these memorable qualities, the highest, the most comprehensive,
the most conclusive is this view that is noble and emancipating, and
leads the one who practises in accordance with it to the complete
destruction of suffering. Just as the highest, the most
comprehensive, the most conclusive part of a pinnacled building is
the pinnacle itself, so too, [323] of these six memorable qualities,
the highest ... is this view that is noble and emancipating ...</P>
<P  >8.
"And how does this view that is noble and emancipating lead the one
who practises in accordance with it to the complete destruction of
suffering?</P>
<P  >"Here
a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty
hut, considers thus: 'Is there any obsession unabandoned in myself
that might so obsess my mind that I cannot know or see things as they
actually are?' If a bhikkhu is obsessed by sensual lust, then his
mind is obsessed. If he is obsessed by ill will, then his mind is
obsessed. If he is obsessed by sloth and torpor, then his mind is
obsessed. If he is obsessed by restlessness and remorse, then his
mind is obsessed. If he is obsessed by doubt, then his mind is
obsessed. If a bhikkhu is absorbed in speculation about this world,
then his mind is obsessed. If a bhikkhu is absorbed in speculation
about the other world, then his mind is obsessed. If a bhikkhu takes
to quarrelling and brawling and is deep in disputes, stabbing others
with verbal daggers, then his mind is obsessed.</P>
<P  >"He
understands thus: 'There is no obsession unabandoned in myself that
might so obsess my mind that I cannot know and see things as they
actually are. My mind is well disposed for awakening to the truths.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote493anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote493sym"><SUP>cdxciii</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the first knowledge attained by him that is noble,
supramundane, not shared by ordinary people.</P>
<P  >9.
"Again, a noble disciple considers thus: 'When I pursue, develop,
and cultivate this view, do I obtain internal serenity, do I
personally obtain stillness?'</P>
<P  >"He
understands thus: 'When I pursue, develop, and cultivate this view,
I obtain internal serenity, I personally obtain stillness.' This is
the second knowledge attained by him that is noble, supramundane, not
shared by ordinary people.</P>
<P  >10.
"Again, a noble disciple considers thus: 'Is there any other
recluse or brahmin outside [the Buddha's Dispensation] possessed of
a view such as I possess?'</P>
<P  >"He
understands thus: 'There is no other recluse or brahmin outside
[the Buddha's Dispensation] possessed of a view [324] such as I
possess.' This is the third knowledge attained by him that is
noble, supramundane, not shared by ordinary people.</P>
<P  >11.
"Again, a noble disciple considers thus: 'Do I possess the
character<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote494anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote494sym"><SUP>cdxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
of a person who possesses right view?' What is the character of a
person who possesses right view? This is the character of a person
who possesses right view: although he may commit some kind of offence
for which a means of rehabilitation has been laid down,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote495anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote495sym"><SUP>cdxcv</SUP></A></SUP>
still he at once confesses, reveals, and discloses it to the Teacher
or to wise companions in the holy life, and having done that, he
enters upon restraint for the future. Just as a young, tender infant
lying prone at once draws back when he puts his hand or his foot on a
live coal, so too, that is the character of a person who possesses
right view.</P>
<P  >"He
understands thus: 'I possess the character of a person who
possesses right view.' This is the fourth knowledge attained by him
that is noble, supramundane, not shared by ordinary people.</P>
<P  >12.
"Again, a noble disciple considers thus: 'Do I possess the
character of a person who possesses right view?' What is the
character of a person who possesses right view? This is the character
of a person who possesses right view: although he may be active in
various matters for his companions in the holy life, yet he has a
keen regard for training in the higher virtue, training in the higher
mind, and training in the higher wisdom. Just as a cow with a new
calf, while she grazes watches her calf, so too, that is the
character of a person who possesses right view.</P>
<P  >"He
understands thus: 'I possess the character of a person who
possesses right view.' This is the fifth knowledge attained by him
that is noble, supramundane, not shared by ordinary people. [325]</P>
<P  >13.
"Again, a noble disciple considers thus: 'Do I possess the
strength<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote496anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote496sym"><SUP>cdxcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
of a person who possesses right view?' What is the strength of a
person who possesses right view? This is the strength of a person who
possesses right view: when the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by
the Tathagata is being taught, he heeds it, gives it attention,
engages it with all his mind, hears the Dhamma as with eager ears.</P>
<P  >"He
understands thus: 'I possess the strength of a person who possesses
right view.' This is the sixth knowledge attained by him that is
noble, supramundane, not shared by ordinary people.</P>
<P  >14.
"Again, a noble disciple considers thus: 'Do I possess the
strength of a person who possesses right view?' What is the
strength of a person who possesses right view? This is the strength
of a person who possesses right view: when the Dhamma and Discipline
proclaimed by the Tathagata is being taught, he gains inspiration in
the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains gladness
connected with the Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote497anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote497sym"><SUP>cdxcvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"He
understands thus: 'I possess the strength of a person who possesses
right view.' This is the seventh knowledge attained by him that is
noble, supramundane, not shared by ordinary people.</P>
<P  >15.
"When a noble disciple is thus possessed of seven factors, he has
well sought the character for realisation of the fruit of
stream-entry. When a noble disciple is thus possessed of seven
factors, he possesses the fruit of stream-entry."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote498anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote498sym"><SUP>cdxcviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
