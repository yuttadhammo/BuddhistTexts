5. Anangana Sutta - Without Blemishes</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There the
venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus. "Friends,
bhikkhus." - "Friend," they replied. The venerable Sariputta
said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Friends, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in
the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote69anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote69sym"><SUP>lxix</SUP></A></SUP>
What four? Here some person with a blemish does not understand it as
it actually is thus: 'I have a blemish in myself.' Here some
person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus: 'I
have a blemish in myself.' Here some person with no blemish does
not understand it as it actually is thus: 'I have no blemish in
myself.' Here some person with no blemish understands it as it
actually is thus: 'I have no blemish in myself.'</P>
<P  >"Herein,
the person with a blemish who does not understand it as it actually
is thus: 'I have a blemish in myself' is called the inferior of
these two persons with a blemish. Herein, the person with a blemish
who understands it as it actually is thus: 'I have a blemish in
myself' is called the superior of these two persons with a blemish.</P>
<P  >"Herein,
the person with no blemish [25] who does not understand it as it
actually is thus: 'I have no blemish' is called the inferior of
these two persons with no blemish. Herein, the person with no blemish
who understands it as it actually is thus: 'I have no blemish' is
called the superior of these two persons with no blemish."</P>
<P  >3.
When this was said, the venerable Maha Moggallana asked the venerable
Sariputta: "Friend Sariputta, what is the cause and reason why, of
these two persons with a blemish, one is called the inferior man and
one is called the superior man? What is the cause and reason why, of
these two persons with no blemish, one is called the inferior man and
one is called the superior man?"</P>
<P  >4.
"Herein, friend, when a person with a blemish does not understand
it as it actually is thus: 'I have a blemish in myself,' it can
be expected that he will not arouse zeal, make effort, or instigate
energy to abandon that blemish, and that he will die with lust, hate,
and delusion, with a blemish, with mind defiled. Suppose a bronze
dish were brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and
stains, and the owners neither used it nor had it cleaned but put it
away in a dusty corner. Would the bronze dish thus get more defiled
and stained later on?" - "Yes, friend." - "So too, friend,
when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is
thus: 'I have a blemish in myself,' it can be expected ... that
he will die ... with mind defiled.</P>
<P  >5.
"Herein, when a person with a blemish understands it as it actually
is thus: 'I have a blemish in myself,' it can be expected that he
will arouse zeal, make effort, and instigate energy to abandon that
blemish, and that he will die without lust, hate, and delusion,
without blemish, with mind undefiled. Suppose a bronze dish were
brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and stains, and the
owners had it cleaned and did not put it in a dusty corner. [26]
Would the bronze dish thus get cleaner and brighter later on?" -
"Yes, friend." - "So too, friend, when a person with a blemish
understands it as it actually is thus: 'I have a blemish in
myself,' it can be expected ... that he will die ... with mind
undefiled.</P>
<P  >6.
"Herein, when a person with no blemish does not understand it as it
actually is thus: 'I have no blemish in myself,' it can be
expected that he will give attention to the sign of the beautiful,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote70anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote70sym"><SUP>lxx</SUP></A></SUP>
that by his doing so lust will infect his mind, and that he will die
with lust, hate, and delusion, with a blemish, with mind defiled.
Suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or smithy clean and
bright, and the owners neither used it nor had it cleaned but put it
in a dusty corner. Would the bronze dish thus get more defiled and
more stained later on?" - "Yes, friend." - "So too, friend,
when a person with no blemish does not understand it as it actually

he will die ... with mind defiled.</P>
<P  >7.
"Herein, when a person with no blemish understands it as it
actually is thus: 'I have no blemish in myself, ' it can be
expected</P>
<P  >that
he will not give attention to the sign of the beautiful, that by his
not doing so lust will not infect his mind, and that he will die
without lust, hate, and delusion, without blemish, with mind
undefiled. Suppose a bronze dish were brought from a shop or smithy
clean and bright, and the owners used it and had it cleaned and did

"This is the cause and reason why, of these two persons with a
blemish, one is called the inferior man and one is called the
superior man. This is the cause and reason why, of these two persons
with no blemish, one is called the inferior man and one is called the
superior man.</P>
<P  >9.
"'Blemish, blemish,' is said, friend, but what is this word
'blemish' a term for? 'Blemish,' friend, is a term for the
spheres of evil unwholesome wishes.</P>
<P  >10.
"It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: 'If I commit an
offence, let the bhikkhus not know that I have committed an offence.'
And it is possible that the bhikkhus come to know that that bhikkhu
has committed an offence. So he is angry and bitter thus: 'The
bhikkhus know I have committed an offence.' The anger and
bitterness are both a blemish.</P>
<P  >11.
"It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: 'I have committed
an offence. The bhikkhus should admonish me in private, not in the
midst of the Sangha.' And it is possible that the bhikkhus admonish
that bhikkhu in the midst of the Sangha, not in private. So he is
angry and bitter thus: 'The bhikkhus admonish me in the midst of
the Sangha, not in private.' The anger and bitterness are both a
blemish.</P>
<P  >12.
"It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: 'I have committed
an offence. A person who is my equal should admonish me, not a person
who is not my equal.' And it is possible that a person not his
equal admonishes him, not a person his equal. So he is angry and
bitter thus: 'A person not my equal admonishes me, not a person my
equal.' The anger and bitterness are both a blemish.</P>
<P  >13.
"It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: 'Oh that the
Teacher might teach the Dhamma to the bhikkhus by asking a series of
questions of me, not of some other bhikkhu!' And it is possible
that the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus by asking a
series of questions of some other bhikkhu, [28] not of that bhikkhu.
So he is angry and bitter thus: 'The Teacher teaches the Dhamma to
the bhikkhus by asking a series of questions of some other bhikkhu,
not of me.' The anger and bitterness are both a blemish.</P>
<P  >14.
"It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: 'Oh that the
bhikkhus might enter the village for alms putting me in the
forefront, not some other bhikkhu!' And it is possible that the
bhikkhus enter the village for alms putting some other bhikkhu in the
forefront, not that bhikkhu. So he is angry and bitter thus: 'The
bhikkhus enter the village for alms putting some other bhikkhu in the
forefront, not me.' The anger and bitterness are both a blemish.</P>
<P  >15.
"It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: 'Oh that I might
get the best seat, the best water, the best almsfood in the
refectory, not some other bhikkhu!' And it is possible that some
other bhikkhu gets the best seat ...</P>
<P  >16.
"It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: 'Oh that I might
give the blessing in the refectory after the meal, not some other
bhikkhu!' And it is possible that some other bhikkhu gives the
blessing ...</P>
<P  >17-20.
"It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: 'Oh that I might
teach the Dhamma to the bhikkhus ... that I might teach the Dhamma to
the bhikkhurus ... men lay followers ... women lay followers ...
visiting the monastery, not some other bhikkhu!' And it is possible
that some other bhikkhu teaches the Dhamma [29] ...</P>
<P  >21-24.
"It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: 'Oh that the
bhikkhus ... bhikkhunis ... men lay followers ... women lay followers
... might honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, not some other
bhikkhu!' And it is possible that they honour ... some other
bhikkhu ...</P>
<P  >25-28.
"It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: 'Oh that I might
be the one to get a superior robe, [30] ... superior almsfood ... a
superior resting place ... superior medicinal requisites ... not some
other bhikkhu!' And it is possible that some other bhikkhu is the
one to get superior medicinal requisites, not that bhikkhu. So he is
angry and bitter thus: 'Another bhikkhu is the one to get superior
medicinal requisites, not me.' The anger and the bitterness are
both a blemish.</P>
<P  >"'Blemish,'
friend, is a term for the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes.</P>
<P  >29.
"If the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and heard
to be unabandoned in any bhikkhu, then for all he may be a forest
dweller, a frequenter of remote abodes, an almsfood eater, a
house-to-house seeker, a refuse-rag wearer, a wearer of rough robes,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote71anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote71sym"><SUP>lxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
still his fellows in the holy life do not honour, respect, revere,
and venerate him. Why is that? Because the spheres of these evil
unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be unabandoned in that
venerable one.</P>
<P  >"Suppose
a metal bowl were brought from a shop or a smithy clean and bright;
and the owners put the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being
in it and, covering it with another bowl, went back to the market;
then people seeing it said: 'What is that you are carrying about
like a treasure?' Then, raising the lid and uncovering it, they
looked in, and as soon as they saw they were inspired with such
loathing, repugnance, and disgust that even those who were hungry
would not want to eat, not to speak of those who were full.</P>
<P  >"So
too, if the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and
heard to be unabandoned in any bhikkhu, then for all he may be a
forest dweller ... [31] ... unabandoned in that venerable one.</P>
<P  >30.
"If the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen and heard
to be abandoned in any bhikkhu, then for all he may be a village
dweller, an acceptor of invitations, a wearer of robes given him by
householders,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote72anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote72sym"><SUP>lxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
yet his fellows in the holy life honour, respect, revere, and
venerate him. Why is that? Because the spheres of these evil
unwholesome wishes are seen and heard to be abandoned in that
venerable one.</P>
<P  >"Suppose
a metal bowl were brought from a shop or a smithy clean and bright;
and the owners put clean boiled rice and various soups and sauces
into it, and, covering it with another bowl, went back to the market;
then people seeing it said: 'What is that you are carrying about
like a treasure?' Then raising the lid and uncovering it, they
looked in, and as soon as they saw they were inspired with such
liking, appetite, and relish that even those who were full would want
to eat, not to speak of those who were hungry.</P>
<P  >"So
too, friend, if the spheres of these evil unwholesome wishes are seen
and heard to be abandoned in any bhikkhu, then for all he may be a
village dweller ... abandoned in that venerable one."</P>
<P  >31.
When this was said, the venerable Maha Moggallana said to the
venerable Sariputta: "A simile occurs to me, friend Sariputta." -
"State it, friend Moggallana." - "On one occasion, friend, I
was living at the Hill Fort at Rajagaha. Then, when it was morning, I
dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe, I went into Rajagaha for
alms. Now on that occasion Samiti the cartwright's son was planing
a felloe and the Ajivaka Panduputta, son of a former cartwright, was
standing by.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote73anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote73sym"><SUP>lxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then this thought arose in the Ajivaka Panduputta's mind: 'Oh
that this Samiti the cartwright's son might plane this bend, this
twist, this fault, out of the felloe so that it would be without
bends, twists, or faults, and come to consist purely of heartwood.'
[32] And just as this thought came to pass in his mind, so did Samiti
the cartwright's son plane that bend, that twist, that fault, out
of the felloe. Then the AjIvaka Panduputta, son of a former
cartwright, was glad and he voiced his gladness thus: 'He planes
just as if he knew my heart with his heart!'</P>
<P  >32.
"So too, friend, there are persons who are faithless and have gone
forth from the home life into homelessness not out of faith but
seeking a livelihood, who are fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous,
haughty, hollow, personally vain, rough-tongued, loose-spoken,
unguarded in their sense faculties, immoderate in eating, undevoted
to wakefulness, unconcerned with recluseship, not greatly respectful
of training, luxurious, careless, leaders in backsliding, neglectful
of seclusion, lazy, wanting in energy, unmindful, not fully aware,
unconcentrated, with straying minds, devoid of wisdom, drivellers.
The venerable Sariputta with his discourse on the Dhamma planes out
their faults just as if he knew my heart with his heart!<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote74anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote74sym"><SUP>lxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"But
there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home
life into homelessness, who are not fraudulent, deceitful,
treacherous, haughty, hollow, personally vain, roughtongued, or
loose-spoken; who are guarded in their sense faculties, moderate in
eating, devoted to wakefulness, concerned with recluseship, greatly
respectful of training, not luxurious or careless, who are keen to
avoid backsliding, leaders in seclusion, energetic, resolute,
established in mindfulness, fully aware, concentrated, with unified
minds, possessing wisdom, not drivellers. These, on hearing the
venerable Sariputta's discourse on the Dhamma, drink it in and eat
it, as it were, by word and thought. Good indeed it is that he makes
his fellows in the holy life emerge from the unwholesome and
establish themselves in the wholesome.</P>
<P  >33.
"Just as a woman - or a man - young, youthful, fond of adornments,
with head bathed, having received a garland of lotuses, jasmine, or
roses, would take it with both hands and place it on the head, so too
there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith ... not
drivellers. These, on hearing the venerable Sariputta's discourse
on the Dhamma, drink it in and eat it, as it were, by word and
thought. Good indeed it is that he makes his fellows in the holy life
emerge from the unwholesome and establish themselves in the
wholesome."</P>
<P  >Thus
it was that these two great beings rejoiced in each other's good
words.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote75anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote75sym"><SUP>lxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
