18. Madhupindika Sutta - The Honeyball</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Kapilavatthu for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu and had returned from his
almsround, after his meal he went to the Great Wood for the day's
abiding, and entering the Great Wood, sat down at the root of a bilva
sapling for the day's abiding.</P>
<P  >3.
Dandapani the Sakyan, while walking and wandering for exercise, also
went to the Great Wood, and when he had entered the Great Wood, he
went to the bilva sapling where the Blessed One was and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he stood at one side leaning on his stick and asked the
Blessed One: "What does the recluse assert, what does he
proclaim?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote226anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote226sym"><SUP>ccxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
"Friend, I assert and proclaim such [a teaching] that one does not
quarrel with anyone in the world with its gods, its Maras, and its
Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its
princes and its people; such [a teaching] that perceptions no more
underlie that brahmin who abides detached from sensual pleasures,
without perplexity, shorn of worry, free from craving for any kind of
being."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote227anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote227sym"><SUP>ccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
When this was said, Dandapani the Sakyan shook his head, [109] wagged
his tongue, and raised his eyebrows until his forehead was puckered
in three lines.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote228anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote228sym"><SUP>ccxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then he departed, leaning on his stick.</P>
<P  >6.
Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and
went to Nigrodha's Park, where he sat down on a seat made ready for
him and told the bhikkhus what had taken place. Then a certain
bhikkhu asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >7.
"But, venerable sir, what is [the teaching] that the Blessed One
asserts whereby one does not quarrel with anyone in the world with
its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation with its
recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people? And, venerable
sir, how is it that perceptions no more underlie that brahmin who
abides detached from sensual pleasures, without perplexity, shorn of
worry, free from craving for any kind of being?"</P>
<P  >8.
"Bhikkhus, as to the source through which perceptions and notions
tinged by mental proliferation beset a man: if nothing is found there
to delight in, welcome and hold to, this is the end of the underlying
tendency to lust, of the underlying tendency to aversion, [110] of
the underlying tendency to views, of the underlying tendency to
doubt, of the underlying tendency to conceit, of the underlying
tendency to desire for being, of the underlying tendency to
ignorance; this is the end of resorting to rods and weapons, of
quarrels, brawls, disputes, recrimination, malice, and false speech;
here these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote229anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote229sym"><SUP>ccxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9.
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One
rose from his seat and went into his dwelling.</P>
<P  >10.
Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the bhikkhus considered:
"Now, friends, the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone
into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding
the detailed meaning. Now who will expound this in detail?" Then
they considered: "The venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the
Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote230anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote230sym"><SUP>ccxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning. Suppose we went to
him and asked him the meaning of this."</P>
<P  >11.
Then the bhikkhus went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, they sat down to one side and told him what had taken
place, [111] adding: "Let the venerable Maha Kaccana expound it to
us."</P>
<P  >12.
[The venerable Maha Kaccana replied:] "Friends, it is as though a
man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, thought that heartwood should be sought for among the
branches and leaves of a great tree standing possessed of heartwood,
after he had passed over the root and the trunk. And so it is with
you, venerable sirs, that you think that I should be asked about the
meaning of this, after you passed the Blessed One by when you were
face to face with the Teacher. For knowing, the Blessed One knows;
seeing, he sees; he is vision, he is knowledge, he is the Dhamma, he
is the holy one;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote231anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote231sym"><SUP>ccxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
he is the sayer, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver
of the Deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the
time when you should have asked the Blessed One the meaning. As he
told you, so you should have remembered it."</P>
<P  >13.
"Surely, friend Kaccana, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he
sees; he is vision ... the Tathagata. That was the time when we
should have asked the Blessed One the meaning. As he told us, so we
should have remembered it. Yet the venerable Maha Kaccana is praised
by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life.
The venerable Maha Kaccana is capable of expounding the detailed
meaning of this summary given in brief by the Blessed One without
expounding the detailed meaning. Let the venerable Maha Kaccana
expound it without finding it troublesome."</P>
<P  >14.
"Then listen, friends, and attend closely to what I shall say." -
"Yes, friend," the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Maha Kaccana
said this:</P>
<P  >15.
"Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his
dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the
detailed meaning, that is: 'Bhikkhus, as to the source through
which perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a
man: if nothing is found there to delight in, welcome, and hold to,
this is the end of the underlying tendency to lust ... this is the
end of resorting to rods and weapons ... here these evil unwholesome
states cease without remainder,' I understand the detailed meaning
of it to be as follows:</P>
<P  >16.
"Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The
meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is
feeling. What one feels, that one perceives. [112] What one
perceives, that one thinks about. What one thinks about, that one
mentally proliferates. With what one has mentally proliferated as the
source, perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset
a man with respect to past, future, and present forms cognizable
through the eye.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote232anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote232sym"><SUP>ccxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Dependent
on the ear and sounds ... Dependent on the nose and odours ...
Dependent on the tongue and flavours ... Dependent on the body and
tangibles ... Dependent on the mind and mindobjects,
mind-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With
contact as condition there is feeling. What one feels, that one
perceives. What one perceives, that one thinks about. What one thinks
about, that one mentally proliferates. With what one has mentally
proliferated as the source, perceptions and notions tinged by mental
proliferation beset a man with respect to past, future, and present
mind-objects cognizable through the mind.</P>
<P  >17.
"When there is the eye, a form, and eye-consciousness, it is
possible to point out the manifestation of contact.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote233anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote233sym"><SUP>ccxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
When there is the manifestation of contact, it is possible to point
out the manifestation of feeling. When there is the manifestation of
feeling, it is possible to point out the manifestation of perception.
When there is the manifestation of perception, it is possible to
point out the manifestation of thinking. When there is the
manifestation of thinking, it is possible to point out the
manifestation of being beset by perceptions and notions tinged by
mental proliferation.</P>
<P  >"When
there is the ear, a sound, and ear-consciousness ... When there is
the nose, an odour, and nose-consciousness ... When there is the
tongue, a flavour, and tongue-consciousness ... When there is the
body, a tangible, and body-consciousness ... When there is the mind,
a mind-object, and mind-consciousness ... it is possible to point out
the manifestation of being beset by perceptions and notions tinged by
mental proliferation.</P>
<P  >18.
"When there is no eye, no form, and no eye-consciousness, it is
impossible to point out the manifestation of contact. When there is
no manifestation of contact, it is impossible to point out the
manifestation of feeling. When there is no manifestation of feeling,
it is impossible to point out the manifestation of perception. When
there is no manifestation of perception, it is impossible to point
out the manifestation of thinking. When there is no manifestation of
thinking, it is impossible to point out the manifestation of being
beset by perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation.</P>
<P  >"When
there is no ear, no sound, and no ear-consciousness ... When there is
no nose, no odour, and no nose-consciousness ...</P>
<P  >When
there is no tongue, no flavour, and no tongueconsciousness ... When
there is no body, no tangible, and no body-consciousness ... When
there is no mind, no mind-object, and no mind-consciousness ... it is
impossible to point out the manifestation of being beset by
perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation.</P>
<P  >19.
"Friends, when the Blessed One [113] rose from his seat and went
into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding
the detailed meaning, that is: 'Bhikkhus, as to the source through
which perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a
man: if nothing is found there to delight in, welcome, and hold to,
this is the end of the underlying tendency to lust, of the underlying
tendency to aversion, of the underlying tendency to views, of the
underlying tendency to doubt, of the underlying tendency to conceit,
of the underlying tendency to desire for being, of the underlying
tendency to ignorance; this is the end of resorting to rods and
weapons, of quarrels, brawls, disputes, recrimination, malice, and
false speech; here these evil unwholesome states cease without
remainder,' I understand the detailed meaning of this summary to be
thus. Now, friends, if you wish, go to the Blessed One and ask him
about the meaning of this. As the Blessed One explains it to you, so
you should remember it."</P>
<P  >20.
Then the bhikkhus, having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable
Maha Kaccana's words, rose from their seats and went to the Blessed
One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told
the Blessed One all that had taken place after he had left, adding:
"Then, venerable sir, we went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and
asked him about the meaning. [114] The venerable Maha Kaccana
expounded the meaning to us with these terms, statements, and
phrases."</P>
<P  >21.
"Maha Kaccana is wise, bhikkhus, Maha Kaccana has great wisdom. If
you had asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to
you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained it. Such is the
meaning of this, and so you should remember it."</P>
<P  >22.
When this was said, the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One:
"Venerable sir, just as if a man exhausted by hunger and weakness
came upon a honeyball,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote234anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote234sym"><SUP>ccxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
in the course of eating it he would find a sweet delectable flavour;
so too, venerable sir, any able-minded bhikkhu, in the course of
scrutinising with wisdom the meaning of this discourse on the Dhamma,
would find satisfaction and confidence of mind. Venerable sir, what
is the name of this discourse on the Dhamma?"</P>
<P  >"As
to that, Ananda, you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as
'The Honeyball Discourse.'"</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
