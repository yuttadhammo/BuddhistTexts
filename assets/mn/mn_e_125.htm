125. Dantabhumi Sutta - The Grade of the Tamed</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the novice Aciravata was living in a forest hut.
Then Prince Jayasena, while wandering and walking for exercise, went
to the novice Aciravata and exchanged greetings with him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1174anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1174sym"><SUP>mclxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and said to the novice Aciravata: "Master Aggivessana, I have
heard that a bhikkhu who abides here diligent, ardent, and resolute
can achieve unification of mind."</P>
<P  >"That
is so, prince, that is so. A bhikkhu who abides here diligent,
ardent, and resolute can achieve unification of mind."</P>
<P  >3.
"It would be good if Master Aggivessana would teach me the Dhamma
as he has heard it and mastered it."</P>
<P  >"I
cannot teach you the Dhamma, prince, as I have heard it and mastered
it. For if I were to teach you the Dhamma as I have heard it and
mastered it, you would not understand the meaning of my words, and
that would be wearying and troublesome for me." [129]</P>
<P  >4.
"Let Master Aggivessana teach me the Dhamma as he has heard it and
mastered it. Perhaps I can understand the meaning of his words."</P>
<P  >"I
shall teach you the Dhamma, prince, as I have heard it and mastered
it. If you can understand the meaning of my words, that will be good.
But if you cannot understand the meaning, then leave it at that and
do not question me about it further."</P>
<P  >"Let
Master Aggivessana teach me the Dhamma as he has heard it and
mastered it. If I can understand the meaning of his words, that will
be good. If I cannot understand the meaning, then I will leave it at
that and I will not question him about it further."</P>
<P  >5.
Then the novice Aciravata taught Prince Jayasena the Dhamma as he had
heard it and mastered it. After he had spoken, Prince Jayasena
remarked: "It is impossible, Master Aggivessana, it cannot happen
that a bhikkhu who abides diligent, ardent, and resolute can achieve
unification of mind." Then, having declared to the novice Aciravata
that this was impossible and could not happen, Prince Jayasena rose
from his seat and departed.</P>
<P  >6.
Soon after Prince Jayasena had left, the novice Aciravata went to the
Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at
one side and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with
Prince Jayasena. When he had finished, the Blessed One said to him:</P>
<P  >7.
"Aggivessana, how is it possible that Prince Jayasena, living in
the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying sensual pleasures, being
devoured by thoughts of sensual pleasures, being consumed by the
fever of sensual pleasures, bent on the search for sensual pleasures,
[130] could know, see, or realise that which must be known through
renunciation, seen through renunciation, attained through
renunciation, realised through renunciation? That is impossible.</P>
<P  >8.
"Suppose,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1175anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1175sym"><SUP>mclxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Aggivessana, there were two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that
were well tamed and well disciplined, and two tamable elephants,
horses, or oxen that were untamed and undisciplined. What do you
think, Aggivessana? Would the two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen
that were well tamed and well disciplined, being tamed, acquire the
behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of the tamed?"
- "Yes, venerable sir." - "But would the two tamable elephants,
horses, or oxen that were untamed and undisciplined, being untamed,
acquire the behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of
the tamed, like the two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were
well tamed and well disciplined?" - "No, venerable sir." - "So
too, Aggivessana, it is impossible that Prince Jayasena, living in
the midst of sensual pleasures, ... could know, see, or realise that
which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation,
attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation.</P>
<P  >9.
"Suppose, Aggivessana, there were a high mountain not far from a
village or town, and two friends would leave the village or town and
approach the mountain hand in hand. Having reached it, one friend
would remain below at the foot of the mountain while the other would
climb to the top. Then the friend who remained below at the foot of
the mountain would say to the friend who stood on the top: 'Well,
friend, what do you see, standing on top of the mountain?' And the
other replied:</P>
<P  >'Standing
on top of the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks, lovely groves,
lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.' Then the first friend would say:
'It is impossible, [131] friend, it cannot happen that while
standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parks, lovely
groves, lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.'</P>
<P  >"Then
the other friend would come down to the foot of the mountain, take
his friend by the arm, and make him climb to the top of the mountain.
After giving him a few moments to catch his breath, he would ask:
'Well, friend, standing on top of the mountain, what do you see?'
And his friend would reply: 'Standing on top of the mountain,
friend, I see lovely parks, lovely groves, lovely meadows, and lovely
ponds.' Then the other would say: 'Friend, just a little earlier
we heard you say: "It is impossible, friend, it cannot happen that
while standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parks ...
lovely ponds." But just now we heard you say: "Standing on top of
the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks ... lovely ponds.'"Then
the first friend would reply: 'Because I was obstructed by this
high mountain, friend, I did not see what was there to be seen.'</P>
<P  >10.
"So too, Aggivessana, Prince Jayasena is obstructed, hindered,
blocked, and enveloped by a still greater mass than this - the mass
of ignorance. Thus it is impossible that Prince Jayasena, living in
the midst of sensual pleasures, ... could know, see, or realise that
which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation,
attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation.</P>
<P  >11.
"Aggivessana, if these two similes had occurred to you [with
reference] to Prince Jayasena, he would have spontaneously acquired
confidence in you, and being confident, would have shown his
confidence to you."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, how could these two similes have occurred to me [with reference]
to Prince Jayasena as they occur to the Blessed One, since they are
spontaneous and have never been heard before?"</P>
<P  >[132]
12. "Suppose, Aggivessana, a head-anointed noble king addresses his
elephant woodsman thus: 'Good elephant woodsman, mount the king's
elephant, enter the elephant wood, and when you see a forest
elephant, bind him by the neck to the king's elephant.' Having
replied 'Yes, sire,' the elephant woodsman mounts the king's
elephant, enters the elephant wood, and when he sees a forest
elephant, binds him by the neck to the king's elephant. The king's
elephant leads him out into the open. It is in this way that a forest
elephant comes out into the open; for the forest elephant clings to
the elephant wood.</P>
<P  >"Then
the elephant woodsman informs the head-anointed noble king: 'Sire,
the forest elephant has come out into the open.' The king addresses
his elephant tamer thus: 'Come, good elephant tamer, tame the
forest elephant. Subdue his forest habits, subdue his forest memories
and intentions, subdue his distress, fatigue, and fever over leaving
the forest. Get him to take delight in the town, inculcate in him
habits congenial to human beings.' Having replied 'Yes, sire,'
the elephant tamer plants a large post in the earth and binds the
forest elephant to it by the neck in order to subdue his forest
habits ... and to inculcate in him habits congenial to human beings.</P>
<P  >"Then
the elephant tamer addresses the elephant with words that are gentle,
pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to the heart, are courteous,
desired by many, and agreeable to many. When the forest elephant
[133] is addressed by such words, he listens, gives ear, and exerts
his mind to understand. The elephant tamer next rewards him with
grass-fodder and water. When the forest elephant accepts the
grass-fodder and water from him, the elephant tamer knows: 'Now the
king's elephant will live!'</P>
<P  >"Then
the elephant tamer trains him further thus: 'Take up, put down!'
When the king's elephant obeys his tamer's orders to take up and
put down and carries out his instructions, the elephant tamer trains
him further thus: 'Go forward, go back!' When the king's
elephant obeys his tamer's orders to go forward and go back and
carries out his instructions, the elephant tamer trains him further
thus: 'Get up, sit down!' When the king's elephant obeys his
tamer's orders to get up and sit down and carries out his
instructions, the elephant tamer trains him further in the task
called imperturbability. He ties a giant plank to his trunk; a man
with a lance in his hand sits on his neck; men with lances in their
hands surround him on all sides; and the elephant tamer himself
stands in front of him holding a long lance pole. When the elephant
is being trained in the task of imperturbability, he does not move
his forelegs or his hindlegs; he does not move his forequarters or
his hindquarters; he does not move his head, ears, tusks, tail, or
trunk. The king's elephant is able to endure blows from spears,
blows from swords, blows from arrows, blows from other beings, and
the thundering sounds of drums, kettledrums, trumpets, and tomtoms.
Being rid of all faults and defects, purged of flaws, he is worthy of
the king, in the king's service, considered one of the factors of a
king. [134]</P>
<P  >13-14.
"So too, Aggivessana, a Tathagata appears in the world,
accomplished, fully enlightened ... (as Sutta 51, §§12-13) ... he
shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the yellow robe, and goes
forth from the home life into homelessness. It is in this way that a
noble disciple comes out into the open; for gods and humans cling to
the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >15.
"Then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, be
virtuous, restrained with the restraint of the Patimokkha, be perfect
in conduct and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, train
by undertaking the training precepts.'</P>
<P  >16.
"When, Aggivessana, the noble disciple is virtuous ... and seeing
fear in the slightest fault, trains by undertaking the training
precepts, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come,
bhikkhu, guard the doors of your sense faculties. On seeing a form
with the eye, do not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if you
were to leave the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of
covetousness and grief might invade you, practise the way of its
restraint, guard the eye faculty, undertake the restraint of the eye
faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear ... On smelling an odour
with the nose ... On tasting a flavour with the tongue ... On
touching a tangible with the body ... On cognizing a mind-object with
the mind, do not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if you were
to leave the mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of
covetousness and grief might invade you, practise the way of its
restraint, guard the mind faculty, undertake the restraint of the
mind faculty.'</P>
<P  >17.
"When, Aggivessana, the noble disciple guards the doors of his
sense faculties, then the Tathagata disciplines him further:</P>
<P  >'Come,
bhikkhu, be moderate in eating. Reflecting wisely, you should take
food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of
physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and
continuance of this body, for ending discomfort, and for assisting
the holy life, considering: "Thus I shall terminate old feelings
without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless
and shall live in comfort.'"</P>
<P  >18.
"When, [135] Aggivessana, the noble disciple is moderate in eating,
then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, be
devoted to wakefulness. During the day, while walking back and forth
and sitting, purify your mind of obstructive states. In the first
watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify
your mind of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night you
should lie down on the right side in the lion's pose with one foot
overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in your
mind the time for rising. After rising, in the last watch of the
night, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify your mind of
obstructive states.'</P>
<P  >19.
"When, Aggivessana, the noble disciple is devoted to wakefulness,
then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, be
possessed of mindfulness and full awareness. Act in full awareness
when going forward and returning ... when looking ahead and looking
away ... when flexing and extending your limbs ... when wearing your
robes and carrying your outer robe and bowl ... when eating,
drinking, consuming food, and tasting. . .when defecating and
urinating ... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking
up, talking, and keeping silent.'</P>
<P  >20.
"When, Aggivessana, the noble disciple possesses mindfulness and
full awareness, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come,
bhikkhu, resort to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of
a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a
jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.'</P>
<P  >21.
"He resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest ... a heap of
straw. On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down,
folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing
mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he
abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from
covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind
free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living
beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning
sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of
light, mindful, and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and
torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated
with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness
and remorse. [136] Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond
doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from
doubt.</P>
<P  >22.
"Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, he abides contemplating the body as a body,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and
grief for the world. He abides contemplating feelings as feelings ...
mind as mind ... mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware,
and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1176anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1176sym"><SUP>mclxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
"Just as, Aggivessana, the elephant tamer plants a large post in
the earth and binds the forest elephant to it by the neck in order to
subdue his forest habits ... and to inculcate in him habits congenial
to human beings, so these four foundations of mindfulness are the
bindings for the mind of the noble disciple in order to subdue his
habits based on the household life, to subdue his memories and
intentions based on the household life, to subdue his distress,
fatigue, and fever based on the household life, and in order that he
may attain the true way and realise Nibbana.</P>
<P  >24.
"Then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu,
abide contemplating the body as a body but do not think thoughts
connected with the body; abide contemplating feelings as feelings but
do not think thoughts connected with feelings; abide contemplating
mind as mind but do not think thoughts connected with the mind; abide
contemplating mindobjects as mind-objects but do not think thoughts
connected with mind-objects.'</P>
<P  >25.
"With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon
and abides in the second jhana<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1177anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1177sym"><SUP>mclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
... the third jhana ... the fourth jhana.</P>
<P  >26-29.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified ... (as Sutta 51,
§§24-27) ... He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.'</P>
<P  >30.
"That bhikkhu is able to endure cold and heat, hunger and thirst,
and contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the sun, and creeping
things; he is able to endure ill-spoken, unwelcome words and arisen
bodily [137] feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing,
disagreeable, distressing, and menacing to life. Being rid of all
lust, hate, and delusion, purged of flaws, he is worthy of gifts,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential
salutations, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.</P>
<P  >31.
"If, Aggivessana, the king's elephant dies in old age untamed and
undisciplined, then. he is considered an old elephant that has died
an untamed death. If the king's elephant dies when middle-aged
untamed and undisciplined, then he is considered a middle-aged
elephant that has died an untamed death. If the king's elephant
dies when young untamed and undisciplined, then he is considered a
young elephant that has died an untamed death. So too, Aggivessana,
if an elder bhikkhu dies with his taints undestroyed, then he is
considered an elder bhikkhu who has died an untamed death. If a
bhikkhu of middle status dies with his taints undestroyed, then he is
considered a bhikkhu of middle status who has died an untamed death.
If a newly ordained bhikkhu dies with his taints undestroyed, then he
is considered a newly ordained bhikkhu who has died an untamed death.</P>
<P  >32.
"If, Aggivessana, the king's elephant dies in old age well tamed
and well disciplined, then he is considered an old elephant that has
died a tamed death. If the king's elephant dies when middle-aged
well tamed and well disciplined, then he is considered a middle-aged
elephant that has died a tamed death. If the king's elephant dies
when young well tamed and well disciplined, then he is considered a
young elephant that has died a tamed death. So too, Aggivessana, if
an elder bhikkhu dies with his taints destroyed, then he is
considered an elder bhikkhu who has died a tamed death. If a bhikkhu
of middle status dies with his taints destroyed, then he is
considered a bhikkhu of middle status who has died a tamed death. If
a newly ordained bhikkhu dies with his taints destroyed, then he is
considered a newly ordained bhikkhu who has died a tamed death."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The novice Aciravata was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
