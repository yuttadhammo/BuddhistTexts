50. Maratajjaniya Sutta - The Rebuke to Mara</H2>
<P  >[332]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Maha Moggallana
was living in the Bhagga country at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala
Grove, the Deer Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Maha Moggallana was walking up and
down in the open. And on that occasion Mara the Evil One went into
the venerable Maha Moggallana's belly and entered his bowels. Then
the venerable Maha Moggallana considered thus: "Why is my belly so
heavy? One would think it full of beans." Thus he left the walk and
went into his dwelling, where he sat down on a seat made ready.</P>
<P  >3.
When he had sat down, he gave thorough attention to himself, and he
saw that Mara the Evil One had gone into his belly and had entered
his bowels. When he saw this, he said: "Come out, Evil One! Come
out, Evil One! Do not harass the Tathagata, do not harass the
Tathagata's disciple, or it will lead to your harm and suffering
for a long time."</P>
<P  >4.
Then Mara the Evil One thought: "This recluse does not know me, he
does not see me when he says that. Even his teacher would not know me
so soon, so how can this disciple know me?"</P>
<P  >5.
Then the venerable Maha Moggallana said: "Even thus I know you,
Evil One. Do not think: 'He does not know me.' You are Mara, Evil
One. You were thinking thus, Evil One: 'This recluse does not know
me, he does not see me when he says that. Even his teacher would not
know me so soon, so how can this disciple know me?'"</P>
<P  >6.
Then Mara the Evil One thought: "The recluse knew me, he saw me
when he said that," whereupon he [333] came up from the venerable
Maha Moggallana's mouth and stood against the door bar.</P>
<P  >7.
The venerable Maha Moggallana saw him standing there and said: "I
see you there too, Evil One. Do not think: 'He does not see me.'
You are standing against the door bar, Evil One.</P>
<P  >8.
"It happened once, Evil One, that I was a Mara named Dusi,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote517anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote517sym"><SUP>dxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
and I had a sister named Kali. You were her son, so you were my
nephew.</P>
<P  >9.
"Now on that occasion the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and
fully enlightened, had appeared in the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote518anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote518sym"><SUP>dxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
The Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, had
an auspicious pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sanjiva.
Among all the disciples of the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished
and fully enlightened, there was none equal to the venerable Vidhura
in teaching the Dhamma. That was how the venerable Vidhura came to
have the designation 'Vidhura.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote519anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote519sym"><SUP>dxix</SUP></A></SUP>
But the venerable Sanjiva, gone to the forest or to the root of a
tree or to an empty hut, entered without difficulty upon the
cessation of perception and feeling.</P>
<P  >10.
"It happened once, Evil One, that the venerable Sanjiva had seated
himself at the root of a certain tree and entered upon the cessation
of perception and feeling. Some cowherds, shepherds, and ploughmen
passing by saw the venerable Sanjiva sitting at the root of the tree
having entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling, and they
thought: 'It is wonderful, sirs, it is marvellous! There is this
recluse sitting here dead. Let us cremate him.' Then the cowherds,
shepherds, and ploughmen collected grass, wood, and cowdung, and
having piled it up against the venerable Sanjiva's body, they set
fire to it and went on their way.</P>
<P  >11.
"Now, Evil One, when the night had ended, the venerable Sanjiva
emerged from the attainment.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote520anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote520sym"><SUP>dxx</SUP></A></SUP>
He shook his robe, and then, it being morning, he dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, he went into the village for alms. The
cowherds, shepherds, and ploughmen passing by saw the venerable
Sanjiva wandering for alms, and they thought: 'It is wonderful,
sirs, it is marvellous! This recluse who was sitting there dead has
come back to life!' [334] That was how the venerable Sanjiva came
to have the designation 'Sanjiva.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote521anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote521sym"><SUP>dxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
"Then, Evil One, the Mara Dusi considered thus: 'There are these
virtuous bhikkhus of good character, but I do not know their coming
or their going. Let me now take possession of the brahmin
householders, telling them: "Come now, abuse, revile, scold, and
harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when
they are abused, reviled, scolded, and harassed by you, some change
will come about in their minds whereby the Mara Dusi may find an
opportunity."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote522anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote522sym"><SUP>dxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
"Then, Evil One, the Mara Dusi took possession of those brahmin
householders, telling them: 'Come now, abuse, revile, scold, and
harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when
they are abused, reviled, scolded, and harassed by you, some change
will come about in their minds whereby the Mara Dusi may find an
opportunity.' Then, when the Mara Dusi had taken possession of the
brahmin householders, they abused, reviled, scolded, and harassed the
virtuous bhikkhus of good character thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote523anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote523sym"><SUP>dxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
'These bald-pated recluses, these swarthy menial offspring of the
Kinsman's feet<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote524anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote524sym"><SUP>dxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
claim: "We are meditators, we are meditators!" and with shoulders
drooping, heads down and all limp, they meditate, premeditate,
outmeditate, and mismeditate.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote525anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote525sym"><SUP>dxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as an owl on a branch waiting for a mouse meditates,
premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates, or just as a jackal on
a river-bank waiting for fish meditates, premeditates, out-meditates,
and mismeditates, or just as a cat by a door-post or a dust-bin or a
drain, waiting for a mouse, meditates, premeditates, out-meditates,
and mismeditates, or just as a donkey unladen, standing by a
door-post or a dust-bin or a drain, meditates, premeditates,
out-meditates, and mismeditates, so too, these bald-pated recluses,
these swarthy menial offspring of the Kinsman's feet, claim: "We
are meditators, we are meditators!" and with shoulders drooping,
heads down and all limp, they meditate, premeditate, out-meditate,
and mismeditate.' Now, Evil One, on that occasion most of those
human beings, when they died, reappeared on the dissolution of the
body, after death, in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy
destination, in perdition, even in hell. [335]</P>
<P  >14.
"Then the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully
enlightened, addressed the bhikkhus thus: 'Bhikkhus, the Mara Dusi
has taken possession of the brahmin householders, telling them: "Come
now, abuse, revile, scold, and harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good
character; then perhaps, when they are abused, reviled, scolded, and
harassed by you, some change will come about in their mind whereby
the Mara Dusi may find an opportunity." Come, bhikkhus, abide
pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness,
likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so
above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to yourselves,
abide pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility
and without ill will. Abide pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with compassion ... with a mind imbued with appreciative joy ... with
a mind imbued with equanimity ... abundant, exalted, immeasurable,
without hostility and without ill will.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote526anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote526sym"><SUP>dxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
"So, Evil One, when those bhikkhus had been thus advised and
instructed by the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully
enlightened, then, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to
an empty hut, they abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with loving-kindness ... with a mind imbued with compassion ... with
a mind imbued with appreciative joy ... with a mind imbued with
equanimity ... without hostility and without ill will.</P>
<P  >16.
"Then, Evil One, the Mara Dusi considered thus: 'Though I do as I
am doing, still I do not know the coming or the going of these
virtuous bhikkhus of good character. Let me now take possession of
the brahmin householders, telling them: "Come now, honour, respect,
revere, and venerate the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; [336]
then perhaps, when they are honoured, respected, revered, and
venerated by you, some change will come about in their minds whereby
the Mara Dusi may find an opportunity.'"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote527anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote527sym"><SUP>dxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >17.
"Then, Evil One, the Mara Dusi took possession of those brahmin
householders, telling them: 'Come now, honour, respect, revere, and
venerate the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when
they are honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by you, some
change will come about in their minds whereby the Mara Dusi may find
an opportunity.' Then, when the Mara Dusi had taken possession of
the brahmin householders, they honoured, respected, revered, and
venerated the virtuous bhikkhus of good character. Now, Evil One, on
that occasion most of those human beings, when they died, reappeared
on the dissolution of the body, after death, in a happy destination,
even the heavenly world.</P>
<P  >18.
"Then, Evil One, the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully
enlightened, addressed the bhikkhus thus: 'Bhikkhus, the Mara Dusi
has taken possession of those brahmin householders, telling them:
"Come now, honour, respect, revere, and venerate the virtuous
bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when they are honoured,
respected, revered, and venerated by you, some change will come about
in their minds whereby the Mara Dusi may find an opportunity."
Come, bhikkhus, abide contemplating foulness in the body, perceiving
repulsiveness in nutriment, perceiving disenchantment with all the
world, contemplating impermanence in all formations.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote528anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote528sym"><SUP>dxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >19.
"So, Evil One, when those bhikkhus had been thus addressed and
instructed by the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully
enlightened, then, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to
an empty hut, they abided contemplating foulness in the body,
perceiving repulsiveness in nutriment, perceiving disenchantment with
all the world, contemplating impermanence in all formations.</P>
<P  >20.
"Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One Kakusandha,
accomplished and fully enlightened, dressed, and taking his bowl and
outer robe, he went into the village for alms with the venerable
Vidhura as his attendant.</P>
<P  >21.
"Then the Mara Dusi took possession of a certain boy, and picking
up a stone, he struck the venerable Vidhura on the head with it and
cut his head. With blood running from his cut head, [337] the
venerable Vidhura followed close behind the Blessed One Kakusandha,
accomplished and fully enlightened. Then the Blessed One Kakusandha,
accomplished and fully enlightened, turned around and looked at him
with the elephant look: 'This Mara Dusi- knows no bounds.' And
with that look, Evil One, the Mara Dusi fell from that place and
reappeared in the Great Hell.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote529anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote529sym"><SUP>dxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >22.
"Now, Evil One, there are three names for the Great Hell: the hell
of the six bases for contact, the hell of the impalement with stakes,
and the hell to be felt for oneself.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote530anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote530sym"><SUP>dxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
Then, Evil One, the wardens of hell came up to me and said: 'Good
sir, when stake meets stake in your heart, then you will know: "I
have been roasting in hell for a thousand years.'"</P>
<P  >23.
"For many a year, Evil One, for many a century, for many a
millennium, I roasted in that Great Hell. For ten millennia I roasted
in the auxiliary of that Great Hell, experiencing the feeling called
that of emergence from ripening.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote531anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote531sym"><SUP>dxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
My body had the same form as a human body, Evil One, but my head had
the form of a fish's head.</P>
<P  >24.
"What can hell be well compared to</P>
<P >
Wherein Dusi roasted, assailant</P>
<P >
Of Vidhura the disciple</P>
<P >
And the brahmin Kakusandha?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote532anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote532sym"><SUP>dxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
Stakes of steel, even a hundred,</P>
<P >
Each one suffered separately;</P>
<P >
These can hell be well compared to</P>
<P >
Wherein Dust roasted, assailant</P>
<P >
Of Vidhura the disciple</P>
<P >
And the brahmin Kakusandha.</P>

<P  >25.
"In the middle of the ocean</P>
<P >
There are mansions aeon-lasting,</P>

"There has never been found a fire</P>
<P >
Which intends, 'Let me burn the fool,'</P>
<P >
But a fool who assaults a fire</P>
<P >
Burns himself by his own doing.</P>
<P >
So it is with you, O Mara:</P>
<P >
By assaulting the Tathagata,</P>
<P >
Like a fool who plays with fire</P>
<P >
You only burn yourself alone.</P>
<P >
By assaulting the Tathagata,</P>
<P >
You generate much demerit.</P>
<P >
Evil One, do you imagine</P>
<P >
That your evil will not ripen?</P>
<P >
Doing thus, you store up evil</P>
<P >
Which will last long, O End-maker!</P>
<P >
Mara, shun the Enlightened One,</P>
<P >
Play no more your tricks on bhikkhus."</P>

So the bhikkhu chastened Mara</P>
