81. Ghatikara Sutta - Ghatikara the Potter</H2>
<P  >[45]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering
among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >2.
Then in a certain place beside the main road the Blessed One smiled.
It occurred to the venerable Ananda: "What is the reason, what is
the cause, for the Blessed One's smile? Tathagatas do not smile for
no reason." So he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and
extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed
One, asked him: "Venerable sir, what is the reason, what is the
cause, for the Blessed One's smile? Tathagatas do not smile for no
reason."</P>
<P  >3.
"Once, Ananda, in this place there was a prosperous and busy market
town called Vebhalinga, with many inhabitants and crowded with
people. Now the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, lived near the market town Vebhalinga. It was here, in
fact, that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, had his monastery; it was here, in fact, that the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, resided and
advised the Sangha of bhikkhus."</P>
<P  >4.
Then the venerable Ananda folded his patchwork cloak in four, and
spreading it out, said to the Blessed One: "Then, venerable sir,
let the Blessed One be seated. Thus this place will have been used by
two Accomplished Ones, Fully Enlightened Ones."</P>
<P  >The
Blessed One sat down on the seat that had been made ready and
addressed the venerable Ananda thus:</P>
<P  >5.
"Once, Ananda, in this place there was a prosperous and busy market
town called Vebhalinga, with many inhabitants and crowded with
people. Now the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, lived near the market town Vebhalinga. It was here, in
fact, that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, had his monastery; it was here, in fact, that the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, resided [46]
and advised the Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >6.
"In Vebhalinga the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, had as a supporter, as his chief supporter, a potter
named Ghatikara. Ghatikara the potter had as a friend, as his close
friend, a brahmin student named Jotipala.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote790anc" HREF="#sdendnote790sym"><SUP>dccxc</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"One
day the potter Ghatikara addressed the brahmin student Jotipala thus:
'My dear Jotipala, let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa,
accomplished and fully enlightened. I hold that it is good to see
that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened.' The brahmin
student Jotipala replied: 'Enough, my dear Ghatikara, what is the
use of seeing that bald-pated recluse?'</P>
<P  >"A
second and third time the potter Ghatikara said: 'My dear Jotipala,
let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened. I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One,
accomplished and fully enlightened.' And a second and a third time
the brahmin student Jotipala replied: 'Enough, my dear Ghatikara,
what is the use of seeing that baldpated recluse?' - 'Then, my
dear Jotipala, let us take a loofah and bath powder and go to the
river to bathe.' - 'Very well,' Jotipala replied.</P>
<P  >7.
"So the potter Ghatikara and the brahmin student Jotipala took a
loofah and bath powder and went to the river to bathe. Then Ghatikara
said to Jotipala: 'My dear Jotipala, there is the monastery of the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, quite
nearby. Let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and
fully enlightened. I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One,
accomplished and fully enlightened.' Jotipala replied: 'Enough,
my dear Ghatikara, what is [47] the use of seeing that bald-pated
recluse?'</P>
<P  >"A
second and a third time Ghatikara said: 'My dear Jotipala, there is
the monastery of the Blessed One Kassapa â€¦ ' And a second and a
third time the brahmin student Jotipala replied: 'Enough, my dear
Ghatikara, what is the use of seeing that bald pated recluse?'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote791anc" HREF="#sdendnote791sym"><SUP>dccxci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
"Then the potter Ghatikara seized the brahmin student Jotipala by
the belt and said: 'My dear Jotipala, there is the monastery of the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, quite
nearby. Let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and
fully enlightened. I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One,
accomplished and fully enlightened.' Then the brahmin student
Jotipala undid his belt and said: 'Enough, my dear Ghatikara, what
is the use of seeing that bald-pated recluse?'</P>
<P  >9.
"Then, when the brahmin student Jotipala had washed his head, the
potter Ghatikara seized him by the hair and said:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote792anc" HREF="#sdendnote792sym"><SUP>dccxcii</SUP></A></SUP>
'My dear Jotipala, there is the monastery of the Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, quite nearby. Let us go
and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened.
I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One, accomplished and
fully enlightened.'</P>
<P  >"Then
the brahmin student Jotipala thought: 'It is wonderful, it is
marvellous that this potter Ghatikara, who is of a different birth,
should presume to seize me by the hair when we have washed our heads!
Surely this can be no simple matter.' And he said to the potter
Ghatikara: 'You go as far as this, my dear Ghatikara?' - 'I go
as far as this, my dear Jotipala; for so much [48] do I hold that it
is good to see that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened!'
- 'Then, my dear Ghatikara, let go of me. Let us visit him.'</P>
<P  >10.
"So Ghatikara the potter and Jotipala the brahmin student went to
the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened.
Ghatikara, after paying homage to him, sat down at one side, while
Jotipala exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, he too sat down at one side. Ghatikara
then said to the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened: 'Venerable sir, this is the brahmin student Jotipala,
my friend, my close friend. Let the Blessed One teach him the
Dhamma.'</P>
<P  >"Then
the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened,
instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged Ghatikara the potter and
Jotipala the brahmin student with an exposition of the Dhamma. At the
conclusion of the exposition, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One Kassapa's words, they rose from their seats, and after
paying homage to the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, keeping him on their right, they departed.</P>
<P  >11.
"Then Jotipala asked Ghatikara: 'Now that you have heard this
Dhamma, my dear Ghatikara, why don't you go forth from the home
life into homelessness?' -'My dear Jotipala, don't you know
that I support my blind and aged parents?' - 'Then, my dear
Ghatikara, I shall go forth from the home life into homelessness.'</P>
<P  >12.
"So Ghatikara the potter and Jotipala the brahmin student went to
the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened. [49]
After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and Ghatikara
the potter said to the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened: 'Venerable sir, this is the brahmin student Jotipala,
my friend, my close friend. Let the Blessed One give him the going
forth.' And the brahmin student Jotipala received the going forth
from the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, and
he received the full admission.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote793anc" HREF="#sdendnote793sym"><SUP>dccxciii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
"Then not long after Jotipala the brahmin student had received the
full admission, a half-month after he had received the full
admission, the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, having stayed at Vebhalinga as long as he chose, set out
to wander towards Benares. Wandering by stages, he eventually arrived
at Benares, and there he went to live in the Deer Park at Isipatana.</P>
<P  >14.
"Now King Kiki of Kasi heard: 'It seems that the Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, has reached Benares and
is living in the Deer Park at Isipatana.' So he had a number of
state carriages made ready, and mounting a state carriage, drove out
from Benares with the full pomp of royalty in order to see the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened. He went thus
as far as the road was passable for carriages, and then he got down
from his carriage and went forward on foot to the Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened. After paying homage to
him, he sat down at one side and the Blessed One Kassapa,
accomplished and fully enlightened, instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged King Kiki of Kasi with an exposition of the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >15.
"At the conclusion of the exposition, King Kiki of Kasi said: [50]
'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of
bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow's meal from me.' And the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, accepted in
silence. Then, knowing that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and
fully enlightened, had accepted, he rose from his seat and after
paying homage to him, keeping him on his right, he departed.</P>
<P  >16.
"Then, when the night had ended, King Kiki of Kasi had good food of
various kinds prepared in his own dwelling - red rice stored in the
sheaf with the dark grains picked out, along with many sauces and
curries - and he had the time announced to the Blessed One Kassapa,
accomplished and fully enlightened, thus: 'It is time, venerable
sir, the meal is ready.'</P>
<P  >17.
"Then, it being morning, the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and
fully enlightened, dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he
went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the dwelling of King Kiki of Kasi
and sat down on the seat made ready. Then, with his own hands, King
Kiki of Kasi served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by
the Buddha with the various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, had eaten and had
withdrawn his hand from the bowl, King Kiki of Kasi took a low seat,
sat down at one side and said: 'Venerable sir, let the Blessed One
accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares; that will be
helpful for the Sangha.' -'Enough, king, my residence for the
Rains has already been provided for.'</P>
<P  >"A
second and a third time King Kiki of Kasi said: 'Venerable sir, let
the Blessed One accept from. me a residence for the Rains in Benares;
that will be helpful for the Sangha.' -'Enough, king, my
residence for the Rains has already been provided for.'</P>
<P  >"The
king thought: 'The Blessed One Kassapa, [51] accomplished and fully
enlightened, does not accept from me a residence for the Rains in
Benares,' and he was very disappointed and sad.</P>
<P  >18.
"Then he said: 'Venerable sir, have you a better supporter than I
am?' - 'I have, great king. There is a market town called
Vebhalinga where a potter named Ghatikara lives. He is my supporter,
my chief supporter. Now you, great king, thought: "The Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, does not accept from me
a residence for the Rains in Benares," and you were very
disappointed and sad; but the potter Ghatikara is not and will not be
so. The potter Ghatikara has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the
Dhamma, and the Sangha. He abstains from killing living beings, from
taking what is not given, from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from
false speech, and from wine, liquor, and intoxicants, which are the
basis of negligence. He has perfect confidence in the Buddha, the
Dhamma, and the Sangha, and he possesses the virtues loved by noble
ones. He is free from doubt about suffering, about the origin of
suffering, about the cessation of suffering, and about the way
leading to the cessation of suffering. He eats only in one part of
the day, he observes celibacy, he is virtuous, of good character. He
has laid aside gems and gold, he has given up gold and silver. He
does not dig the ground for clay using a pick with his own hand; what
is left over from embankments or thrown up by rats, he brings home in
a carrier; when he has made a pot he says: "Let anyone who likes
set down some selected rice or selected beans or selected lentils,
and let him take away whatever he likes."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote794anc" HREF="#sdendnote794sym"><SUP>dccxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
He supports his blind and aged parents. [52] Having destroyed the
five lower fetters, he is one who will reappear spontaneously [in the
Pure Abodes] and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning
from that world.</P>
<P  >19.
"'On one occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga, it being
morning, I dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe, I went to the
potter Ghatikara's parents and asked them: "Where has the potter
gone, please?" - "Venerable sir, your supporter has gone out; but
take rice from the cauldron and sauce from the saucepan and eat."</P>
<P  >"'I
did so and went away. Then the potter Ghatikara went to his parents
and asked: "Who has taken rice from the cauldron and sauce from the
saucepan, eaten and gone away?" - "My dear, the Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, did."</P>
<P  >"'Then
the potter Ghatikara thought: "It is a gain for me, it is a great
gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, relies on me thus!" And rapture and happiness never
left him for a half-month or his parents for a week.</P>
<P  >20.
"'On another occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga, it being
morning, I dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe, I went to the
potter Ghatikara's parents and asked them: "Where has the potter
gone, please?" - "Venerable sir, your supporter has gone out; but
take some porridge from the vessel and sauce from the saucepan and
eat."</P>
<P  >"'I
did so [53] and went away. Then the potter Ghatikara went to his
parents and asked: "Who has taken porridge from the vessel and
sauce from the saucepan, eaten and gone away?" - "My dear, the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, did."</P>
<P  >"'Then
the potter Ghatikara thought: "It is a gain for me, it is a great
gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, relies on me thus!" And rapture and happiness never
left him for a half-month or his parents for a week.</P>
<P  >21.
"'On another occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga my hut
leaked. Then I addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Go, bhikkhus, and find
out if there is any grass at the potter Ghatikara's house." -
"Venerable sir, there is no grass at the potter Ghatikara's
house; there is the grass thatch on his roof." - "Go, bhikkhus,
and remove the grass from the potter Ghatikara's house."</P>
<P  >"'They
did so. Then the potter Ghatikara's parents asked the bhikkhus:
"Who is removing the grass from the house?" - "Sister, the hut
of the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, is
leaking." - "Take it, venerable sirs, take it and bless you!"</P>
<P  >"'Then
the potter Ghatikara went to his parents and asked: "Who has
removed the grass from the roof?" - "The bhikkhus did, my dear;
the hut of the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, is leaking."</P>
<P  >"'Then
the potter Ghatikara thought: "It is a gain for me, it is a great
gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, relies on me thus!" And [54] the rapture and happiness
never left him for a half-month or his parents for a week. Then that
house remained three whole months with the sky for a roof, and yet no
rain came in. Such is the potter Ghatikara.'</P>
<P  >"'It
is a gain for the potter Ghatikara, it is a great gain for him that
the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, relies
on him thus.'</P>
<P  >22.
"Then King Kiki of Kasi dispatched to the potter Ghatikara five
hundred cartloads of red rice stored in the sheaf, and also sauce
materials to go with it. Then the king's men went to the potter
Ghatikara and told him: 'Venerable sir, there are five hundred
cartloads of red rice stored in the sheaf, and also sauce materials
to go with it, dispatched to you by King Kiki of Kasi; please accept
them.' - 'The king is very busy and has much to do. I have
enough. Let this be for the king himself.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote795anc" HREF="#sdendnote795sym"><SUP>dccxcv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
"Now, Ananda, you may think thus: 'Certainly, someone else was
the brahmin student Jotipala on that occasion.' But it should not
be regarded thus. I was the brahmin student Jotipala on that
occasion."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
