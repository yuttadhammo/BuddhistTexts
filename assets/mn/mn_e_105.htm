105. Sunakkhatta Sutta - To Sunakkhatta</H2>
<P  >[252]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus had declared final
knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One thus: "We understand:
Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done
has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being."</P>
<P  >3.
Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote995anc" HREF="#sdendnote995sym"><SUP>cmxcv</SUP></A></SUP>
heard: "A number of bhikkhus, it seems, have declared final
knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One thus: 'We understand:
Birth is destroyed … there is no more coming to any state of
being.'"Then Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, went to the
Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side
and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >4.
"I have heard, venerable sir, that a number of bhikkhus have
declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One. Did they
do so rightly or are there some bhikkhus here who declare final
knowledge because they overestimate themselves?"</P>
<P  >5.
"When those bhikkhus, Sunakkhatta, declared final knowledge in my
presence, there were some bhikkhus who declared final knowledge
rightly and there were some who declared final knowledge because they
overestimated themselves.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote996anc" HREF="#sdendnote996sym"><SUP>cmxcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Therein, when bhikkhus declare final knowledge rightly, their
declaration is true. But when bhikkhus declare final knowledge
because they overestimate themselves, the Tathagata thinks: 'Let me
teach them the Dhamma.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote997anc" HREF="#sdendnote997sym"><SUP>cmxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Thus it is in this case, Sunakkhatta, that the Tathagata thinks: 'Let
me teach them the Dhamma.' But some misguided men here formulate a
question, come to the Tathagata, and ask it. In that case,
Sunakkhatta, [253] though the</P>
<P  >Tathagata
has thought: 'Let me teach them the Dhamma,' he changes his
mind."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote998anc" HREF="#sdendnote998sym"><SUP>cmxcviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
"This is the time, Blessed One, this is the time, Sublime One, for
the Blessed One to teach the Dhamma. Having heard it from the Blessed
One, the bhikkhus will remember it."</P>
<P  >"Then
listen, Sunakkhatta, and attend closely to what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, replied to the
Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >7.
"There are, Sunakkhatta, these five cords of sensual pleasure. What
are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >8.
"It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some person here may be intent
on worldly material things.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote999anc" HREF="#sdendnote999sym"><SUP>cmxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
When a person is intent on worldly material things, only talk
concerning that interests him, and his thinking and pondering are in
line with that, and he associates with that kind of person, and he
finds satisfaction through him. But when talk about the imperturbable
is going on, he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his
mind to understand it. He does not associate with that kind of
person, and he does not find satisfaction through him.</P>
<P  >9.
"Suppose, Sunakkhatta, a man had left his own village or town a
long time ago, and he were to see another man who had only recently
left that village or town. He would ask that man whether the people
of that village or town were safe, prosperous, and healthy, and that
man would tell him whether the people of that village or town were
safe, prosperous, [254] and healthy. What do you think, Sunakkhatta?
Would that first man listen to him., give him ear, and exert his mind
to understand?" - "Yes, venerable sir." - "So too,
Sunakkhatta, it is possible that some person here may be intent on
worldly material things. When a person is intent on worldly material
things … and he does not find satisfaction through him. He should
be understood as a person who is intent on worldly material things.</P>
<P  >10.
"It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some person here may be intent
on the imperturbable.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1000anc" HREF="#sdendnote1000sym"><SUP>m</SUP></A></SUP>
When a person is intent on the imperturbable, only talk concerning
that interests him, and his thinking and pondering are in line with
that, and he associates with that kind of person, and he finds
satisfaction through him. But when talk about worldly material things
is going on, he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his
mind to understand it. He does not associate with that kind of
person, and he does not find satisfaction through him.</P>
<P  >11.
"Just as a yellow leaf that has fallen from its stalk is incapable
of becoming green again, so too, Sunakkhatta, when a person is intent
on the imperturbable he has shed the fetter of worldly material
things. He should be understood as a person not bound by the fetter
of worldly material things who is intent on the imperturbable.</P>
<P  >12.
"It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some person here may be intent
on the base of nothingness. When a person is intent on the base of
nothingness, only talk concerning that interests him, and his
thinking and pondering are in line with that, and he associates with
that kind of person, and he finds satisfaction through him. [255] But
when talk about the imperturbable is going on, he will not listen to
it or give it ear or exert his mind to understand it. He does not
associate with that kind of person, and he does not find satisfaction
through him.</P>
<P  >13.
"Just as a thick stone that has split in two cannot be joined
together again, so too, Sunakkhatta, when a person is intent on the
base of nothingness his fetter of the imperturbable has been split.
He should be understood as a person not bound by the fetter of the
imperturbable who is intent on the base of nothingness.</P>
<P  >14.
"It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some person here may be intent
on the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. When a person
is intent on the base of neither-perception-nornon-perception, only
talk concerning that interests him, and his thinking and pondering
are in line with that, and he associates with that kind of person,
and he finds satisfaction through him. But when talk about the base
of nothingness is going on, he will not listen to it or give it ear
or exert his mind to understand it. He does not associate with that
kind of person, and he does not find satisfaction through him.</P>
<P  >15.
"Suppose a person has eaten some delicious food and thrown it up.
What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Could that man have any desire to eat
that food again?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because that food is considered
repulsive."</P>
<P  >"So
too, Sunakkhatta, when a person is intent on the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, his fetter of the base of
nothingness has been rejected. He should be understood as a person
not bound by the fetter of the base of nothingness who is intent on
the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</P>
<P  >16.
"It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some person here may be
completely intent on Nibbana. When a person is completely intent on
Nibbana, only talk concerning that interests him, and his thinking
and pondering are in line with that, and he associates with that kind
of person, and he finds satisfaction through him. But when talk about
the base of neither-perception-nornon-perception is going on, [256]
he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his mind to
understand it. He does not associate with that kind of person, and he
does not find satisfaction through him.</P>
<P  >17.
"Just as a palm tree with its top cut off is incapable of growing
again, so too, Sunakkhatta, when a person is completely intent on
Nibbana, his fetter of the base of
neither-perceptionnor-non-perception has been cut off - cut off at
the root, made like a palm stump, done away with so that it is no
longer subject to future arising. He should be understood as a person
not bound by the fetter of the base of
neither-perception-nor-nonperception who is completely intent on
Nibbana.</P>
<P  >18.
"It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some bhikkhu here might think
thus: 'Craving has been called an arrow by the Recluse;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1001anc" HREF="#sdendnote1001sym"><SUP>mi</SUP></A></SUP>
the poisonous humour of ignorance is spread about by desire, lust,
and ill will. That arrow of craving has been removed from me; the
poisonous humour of ignorance has been expelled. I am one who is
completely intent on Nibbana.' Because he falsely thinks of himself
thus,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1002anc" HREF="#sdendnote1002sym"><SUP>mii</SUP></A></SUP>
he might pursue those things that are unsuitable for one completely
intent on Nibbana. He might pursue the sight of unsuitable forms with
the eye, he might pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear, unsuitable
odours with the nose, unsuitable flavours with the tongue, unsuitable
tangibles with the body, or unsuitable mind-objects with the mind.
When he pursues the sight of unsuitable forms with the eye …
unsuitable mind-objects with the mind, lust invades his mind. With
his mind invaded by lust, he would incur death or deadly suffering.</P>
<P  >19.
"Suppose, Sunakkhatta, a man were wounded by an arrow thickly
smeared with poison, and his friends and companions, his kinsmen and
relatives, brought a surgeon. The surgeon would cut around the
opening of the wound with a knife, then he would probe for the arrow
with a probe, [257] then he would pull out the arrow and would expel
the poisonous humour, leaving a trace of it behind. Knowing that a
trace was left behind,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1003anc" HREF="#sdendnote1003sym"><SUP>miii</SUP></A></SUP>
he would say: 'Good man, the arrow has been pulled out from you;
the poisonous humour has been expelled with a trace left behind, but
it is incapable of harming you. Eat only suitable food; do not eat
unsuitable food or else the wound may suppurate. From time to time
wash the wound and from time to time anoint its opening, so that pus
and blood do not cover the opening of the wound. Do not walk around
in the wind and sun or else dust and dirt may infect the opening of
the wound. Take care of your wound, good man, and see to it that the
wound heals.'</P>
<P  >20.
"The man would think: 'The arrow has been pulled out from me; the
poisonous humour has been expelled with no trace left behind, and it
is incapable of harming me.' He would eat unsuitable food, and the
wound would suppurate. He would not wash the wound from time to time
nor would he anoint its opening from time to time, and pus and blood
would cover the opening of the wound. He would walk around in the
wind and sun, and dust and dirt would infect the opening of the
wound. He would not take care of his wound, nor would he see to it
that the wound heals. Then, both because he does what is unsuitable
and because the foul poisonous humour had been expelled with a trace
left behind, the wound would swell, and with its swelling he would
incur death or deadly suffering.</P>
<P  >21.
"So too, Sunakkhatta, it is possible that some bhikkhu here might
think thus: 'Craving has been called an arrow by the Recluse; the
poisonous humour of ignorance is spread about by desire, lust, and
ill will. That arrow of craving has been removed from me; [258] the
poisonous humour of ignorance has been expelled. I am completely
intent upon Nibbana.' Because he falsely thinks of himself thus, he
might pursue those things that are unsuitable for one completely
intent on Nibbana … (as above) … With his mind invaded by lust,
he would incur death or deadly suffering.</P>
<P  >22.
"For it is death in the Discipline of the Noble One, Sunakkhatta,
when one abandons the training and reverts to the low life; and it is
deadly suffering when one commits some defiled offence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1004anc" HREF="#sdendnote1004sym"><SUP>miv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
"It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some bhikkhu here might think

poisonous humour of ignorance is spread about by desire, lust, and
ill will. That arrow of craving has been removed from me; the
poisonous humour of ignorance has been expelled. I am one who is
completely intent on Nibbana.' Being one who really is completely
intent on Nibbana, he would not pursue those things that are
unsuitable for one completely intent on Nibbana. He would not pursue
the sight of unsuitable forms with the eye, he would not pursue
unsuitable sounds with the ear, unsuitable odours with the nose,
unsuitable flavours with the tongue, unsuitable tangibles with the
body, or unsuitable mind-objects with the mind. Because he does not
pursue the sight of unsuitable forms with the eye … unsuitable
mind-objects with the mind, lust does not invade his mind. [259]
Because his mind is not invaded by lust, he would not incur death or
deadly suffering.</P>
<P  >24.

good man, and see to it that the wound heals.'</P>

"The man would think: 'The arrow has been pulled out from me; the

to it that the wound heals. Then, both because he does what is
suitable and because the foul poisonous humour has been expelled with
no trace left behind, the wound would heal, and because it had healed
and was covered with skin, he would not incur death or deadly
suffering.</P>
<P  >26.
"So too, Sunakkhatta, it is possible that some bhikkhus here might
think thus: 'Craving has been called an arrow by the Recluse; [260]
the poisonous humour of ignorance is spread about by desire, lust,
and ill will. That arrow of craving has been pulled out from me; the
poisonous humour of ignorance has been expelled. I am one who is

<P  >27.
"Sunakkhatta, I have given this simile in order to convey a
meaning. This is the meaning here: 'Wound' is a term for the six
internal bases. 'Poisonous humour' is a term for ignorance.
'Arrow' is a term for craving. 'Probe' is a term for
mindfulness. 'Knife' is a term for noble wisdom. 'Surgeon' is
a term for the Tathagata, the Accomplished One, the Fully Enlightened
One.</P>
<P  >28.
"When, Sunakkhatta, a bhikkhu practises restraint in the six bases
of contact, and having understood that attachment is the root of
suffering,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1005anc" HREF="#sdendnote1005sym"><SUP>mv</SUP></A></SUP>
is without attachment, liberated by the destruction of attachment, it
is not possible that he would direct his body or arouse his mind
towards any object of attachment.</P>
<P  >29.
"Suppose, Sunakkhatta, there were a bronze cup of beverage
possessing a good colour, smell, and taste, but it was mixed with
poison, and a man came who wanted to live, not to die, who wanted
pleasure and recoiled from pain.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1006anc" HREF="#sdendnote1006sym"><SUP>mvi</SUP></A></SUP>
What do you think, Sunakkhatta, would that man drink that cup of
beverage, knowing: 'If I drink this I will incur death or deadly
suffering'?" - "No, venerable sir." [261] - "So too, when a
bhikkhu practises restraint in the six bases of contact, and having
understood that attachment is the root of suffering, is without
attachment, liberated by the destruction of attachment, it is not
possible that he would direct his body or arouse his mind towards any
object of attachment.</P>
<P  >30.
"Suppose, Sunakkhatta, there were a deadly poisonous snake, and a
man came who wanted to live, not to die, who wanted pleasure and
recoiled from pain. What do you think, Sunakkhatta, would that man
give that deadly poisonous snake his hand or his thumb, knowing: 'If
I am bitten by him I will incur death or deadly suffering'?" -
"No, venerable sir." - "So too, when a bhikkhu practises
restraint in the six bases of contact, and having understood that
attachment is the root of suffering, is without attachment, liberated
by the destruction of attachment, it is not possible that he would
direct his body or arouse his mind towards any object of attachment."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, was
satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
