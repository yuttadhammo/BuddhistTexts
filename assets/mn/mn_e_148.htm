148. Chachakka Sutta - The Six Sets of Six</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the Dhamma that is good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right
meaning and phrasing; I shall reveal a holy life that is utterly
perfect and pure,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1328anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1328sym"><SUP>mcccxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
that is, the six sets of six. Listen and attend closely to what I
shall say." - "Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The
Blessed One said this:</P>
<H3 >(SYNOPSIS)</H3>
<P  >3.
"The six internal bases should be understood. The six external
bases should be understood. The six classes of consciousness should
be understood. The six classes of contact should be understood. The
six classes of feeling should be understood. The six classes of
craving should be understood.</P>
<H3 >(ENUMERATION)</H3>
<P  >4.
(i) "'The six internal bases should be understood.' So it was
said. And with reference to what was this said? There are the
eye-base, the ear-base, the nose-base, the tongue-base, the bodybase,
and the mind-base. So it was with reference to this that it was said:
'The six internal bases should be understood.' This is the first
set of six. [281]</P>
<P  >5.
(ii) "'The six external bases should be understood.' So it was
said. And with reference to what was this said? There are the
form-base, the sound-base, the odour-base, the flavour-base, the</P>
<P  >tangible-base,
and the mind-object-base. So it was with reference to this that it
was said: 'The six external bases should be understood.' This is
the second set of six.</P>
<P  >6.
(iii) "'The six classes of consciousness should be understood.'
So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent
on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; dependent on the ear
and sounds, ear-consciousness arises; dependent on the nose and
odours, nose-consciousness arises; dependent on the tongue and
flavours, tongue-consciousness arises; dependent on the body and
tangibles, body-consciousness arises; dependent on the mind and
mind-objects, mindconsciousness arises. So it was with reference to
this that it was said: 'The six classes of consciousness should be
understood.' This is the third set of six.</P>
<P  >7.
(iv) "'The six classes of contact should be understood.' So it
was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the
eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is
contact. Dependent on the ear and sounds, earconsciousness arises;
the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the nose and
odours, nose-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is
contact. Dependent on the tongue and flavours, tongue-consciousness
arises; the meeting of the three is contact. Dependent on the body
and tangibles, body-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is
contact. Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness
arises; the meeting of the three is contact. So it was with reference
to this that it was said: 'The six classes of contact should be
understood.' This is the fourth set of six.</P>
<P  >8.
(v) "'The six classes of feeling should be understood.' So it
was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the
eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is
contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the
ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is
contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on the
nose and odours, nose-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three
is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling. Dependent on
the tongue and flavours, tongue-consciousness arises; the meeting of
the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling.
Dependent on the body and tangibles, body-consciousness arises; the
meeting of the three is contact; with contact as condition there is
feeling. Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness
arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as
condition there is feeling. So it was with reference to this that it
was said: 'The six classes of feeling should be understood.'
[282] This is the fifth set of six.</P>
<P  >9.
(vi) "'The six classes of craving should be understood.' So it
was said. And with reference to what was this said? Dependent on the
eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is
contact; with contact as condition there is feeling; with feeling as
condition there is craving.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1329anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1329sym"><SUP>mcccxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Dependent on the ear and sounds, ear-consciousness arises ... with
feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on the nose and
odours, nose-consciousness arises ... with feeling as condition there
is craving. Dependent on the tongue and flavours,
tongue-consciousness arises ... with feeling as condition there is
craving. Dependent on the body and tangibles, body-consciousness
arises ... with feeling as condition there is craving. Dependent on
the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises; the meeting of
the three is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling;
with feeling as condition there is craving. So it was with reference
to this that it was said: 'The six classes of craving should be
understood.' This is the sixth set of six.</P>

eye-consciousness arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with
contact as condition there arises [a feeling] felt as pleasant or
painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant. When one is touched by a
pleasant feeling, if one delights in it, welcomes it, and remains
holding to it, then the underlying tendency to lust lies within one.
When one is touched by a painful feeling, if one sorrows, grieves and
laments, weeps beating one's breast and becomes distraught, then
the underlying tendency to aversion lies within one. When one is
touched by a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, if one does not
understand as it actually is the origination, the disappearance, the
gratification, the danger, and the escape in regard to that feeling,
then the underlying tendency to ignorance lies within one. Bhikkhus,
that one shall here and now make an end of suffering without
abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling,
without abolishing the underlying tendency to aversion towards
painful feeling, without extirpating the underlying tendency to
ignorance in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, without

becomes disenchanted with the ear ... He becomes disenchanted with

disenchanted with the body ... He becomes disenchanted with the mind,
disenchanted with mindobjects, disenchanted with mind-consciousness,
disenchanted with mind-contact, disenchanted with feeling,
disenchanted with craving.</P>

"Being disenchanted, [287] he becomes dispassionate. Through
dispassion [his mind] is liberated. When it is liberated, there comes
the knowledge: 'It is liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is
destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been
done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'"</P>
