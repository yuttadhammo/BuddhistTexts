103. Kinti Sutta - What Do You Think About Me?</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Kusinara, in the Grove of Offerings. There he addressed the bhikkhus
thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir," they replied. The
Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"What do you think about me, bhikkhus? That the recluse Gotama
teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes? Or that the recluse Gotama
teaches the Dhamma for the sake of almsfood? Or that the recluse
Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of a resting place? Or that
the recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of some better
state of being?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote969anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote969sym"><SUP>cmlxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"We
do not think thus about the Blessed One: 'The recluse Gotama
teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes, or for the sake of
almsfood, or for the sake of a resting place, or for the sake of some
better state of being.'"</P>
<P  >"So,
bhikkhus, you do not think thus about me: 'The recluse Gotama
teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes ... or for the sake of some
better state of being.' Then what do you think about me?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, we think thus about the Blessed One: 'The Blessed One is
compassionate and seeks our welfare; he teaches the Dhamma out of
compassion.'"</P>
<P  >"So,
bhikkhus, you think thus about me: 'The Blessed One is
compassionate and seeks our welfare; he teaches the Dhamma out of
compassion.'</P>
<P  >3.
"So, bhikkhus, these things that I have taught you after directly
knowing them - that is, the four foundations of mindfulness, the four
right kinds of striving, the four bases for spiritual power, the five
faculties, the five powers, the seven [239] enlightenment factors,
the Noble Eightfold Path - in these things you should all train in
concord, with mutual appreciation, without disputing.</P>
<P  >4.
"While you are training in concord, with mutual appreciation,
without disputing, two bhikkhus might differ about the higher
Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote970anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote970sym"><SUP>cmlxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
"Now if you should think thus: 'These venerable ones differ about
both the meaning and the phrasing,'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote971anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote971sym"><SUP>cmlxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
then whichever bhikkhu you think is the more reasonable should be
approached and addressed thus: 'The venerable ones differ about
both the meaning and the phrasing. The venerable ones should know
that it is for this reason that there is difference about the meaning
and difference about the phrasing; let them not fall into a dispute.'
Then whichever bhikkhu you think is the most reasonable of those who
side together on the opposite part should be approached and addressed
thus: 'The venerable ones differ about the meaning and the
phrasing. The venerable ones should know that it is for this reason
that there is difference about the meaning and difference about the
phrasing; let them not fall into a dispute.' So what has been
wrongly grasped should be borne in mind as wrongly grasped. Bearing
in mind what has been wrongly grasped as wrongly grasped, what is
Dhamma and what is Discipline should be expounded.</P>
<P  >6.
"Now if you should think thus: 'These venerable ones differ about
the meaning but agree about the phrasing,' then whichever bhikkhu
you think is the more reasonable should be approached and addressed
thus: 'The venerable ones differ about the meaning but agree about
the phrasing. The venerable ones should know that it is for this
reason that there is difference about the meaning but agreement about
the phrasing; let them not fall into a dispute.' Then whichever
bhikkhu you think is the most reasonable of those who side together
on the opposite part should be approached and addressed thus: 'The
venerable ones differ about the meaning but agree about the phrasing.
The venerable ones should know that it is for this reason that there
is difference about the meaning but agreement about the phrasing; let
them not fall into a dispute.' [240] So what has been wrongly
grasped should be borne in mind as wrongly grasped and what has been
rightly grasped should be borne in mind as rightly grasped. Bearing
in mind what has been wrongly grasped as wrongly grasped, and bearing
in mind what has been rightly grasped as rightly grasped, what is
Dhamma and what is Discipline should be expounded.</P>
<P  >7.
"Now if you think thus: 'These venerable ones agree about the
meaning but differ about the phrasing,' then whichever bhikkhu you
think is the more reasonable should be approached and addressed thus:
'The venerable ones agree about the meaning but differ about the
phrasing. The venerable ones should know that it is for this reason
that there is agreement about the meaning but difference about the
phrasing. But the phrasing is a mere trifle. Let the venerable ones
not fall into a dispute over a mere trifle.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote972anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote972sym"><SUP>cmlxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then whichever bhikkhu you think is the most reasonable of those who
side together on the opposite part should be approached and addressed
thus: 'The venerable ones agree about the meaning but differ about
the phrasing. The venerable ones should know that it is for this
reason that there is agreement about the meaning but difference about
the phrasing. But the phrasing is a mere trifle. Let the venerable
ones not fall into a dispute over a mere trifle.' So what has been
rightly grasped should be borne in mind as rightly grasped and what
has been wrongly grasped should be borne in mind as wrongly grasped.
Bearing in mind what has been rightly grasped as rightly grasped, and
bearing in mind what has been wrongly grasped as wrongly grasped,
what is Dhamma and what is Discipline should be expounded.</P>
<P  >8.
"Now if you should think thus: 'These venerable ones agree about
both the meaning and the phrasing,' then whichever bhikkhu you

'The venerable ones agree about both the meaning and the phrasing.

ones not [241] fall into a dispute.' So what has been rightly
grasped should be borne in mind as rightly grasped. Bearing in mind
what has been rightly grasped as rightly grasped, what is Dhamma and
what is Discipline should be expounded.</P>

"While you are training in concord, with mutual appreciation,
without disputing, some bhikkhu might commit an offence or a
transgression.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote973anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote973sym"><SUP>cmlxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

"Now, bhikkhus, you should not hurry to reprove him; rather, the
person should be examined thus: 'I shall not be troubled and the
other person will not be hurt; for the other person is not given to
anger and revenge, he is not firmly attached to his view and he
relinquishes easily, and I can make that person emerge from the
unwholesome and establish him in the wholesome.' If such occurs to
you, bhikkhus, it is proper to speak.</P>
<P  >11.
"Then it may occur to you, bhikkhus: 'I shall not be troubled,
but the other person will be hurt, for the other person is given to
anger and revenge. However, he is not firmly attached to his view and
he relinquishes easily, and I can make that person emerge from the
unwholesome and establish him in the wholesome. It is a mere trifle
that the other person will be hurt, but it is a much greater thing
that I can make that person emerge from the unwholesome and establish
him in the wholesome.' If such occurs to you, bhikkhus, it is
proper to speak.</P>
<P  >12.
"Then it may occur to you, bhikkhus: 'I shall be troubled, but
the other person will not be hurt; for the other person is not given
to anger and revenge, though he is firmly attached to his view and he
relinquishes with difficulty; yet I can make that person emerge from
the unwholesome and establish him in the wholesome. It is a mere
trifle that I shall be troubled, but it is a much greater thing that
I can make that person emerge from the unwholesome and establish him
in the wholesome.' If such occurs to you, bhikkhus, it is proper to
speak.</P>
<P  >13.
"Then it may occur to you, bhikkhus: 'I shall be troubled and the
other person will be hurt; [242] for the other person is given to
anger and revenge, and he is firmly attached to his view and he
relinquishes with difficulty; yet I can make that person emerge from
the unwholesome and establish him in the wholesome. It is a mere
trifle that I shall be troubled and the other person hurt, but it is
a much greater thing that I can make that person emerge from the
unwholesome and establish him in the wholesome.' If such occurs to
you, bhikkhus, it is proper to speak.</P>
<P  >14.
"Then it may occur to you, bhikkhus: 'I shall be troubled and the
other person will be hurt; for the other person is given to anger and
revenge, and he is firmly attached to his view and</P>
<P  >he
relinquishes with difficulty; and I cannot make that person emerge
from the unwholesome and establish him in the wholesome.' One
should not underrate equanimity towards such a person.</P>
<P  >15.
"While you are training in concord, with mutual appreciation,
without disputing, there might arise mutual verbal friction,
domineering views, mental annoyance, bitterness, and dejection. Then
whichever bhikkhu you think is the most reasonable of those who side
together on the one part should be approached and addressed thus:
'While we were training in concord, friend, with mutual
appreciation, without disputing, there arose mutual verbal friction,
domineering views, mental annoyance, bitterness, and dejection. If
the Recluse knew, would he censure that?'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote974anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote974sym"><SUP>cmlxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Answering rightly, the bhikkhu would answer thus: 'While we were
training ... If the Recluse knew, he would censure that.'</P>
<P  >"'But,
friend, without abandoning that thing, can one realise Nibbana?'
Answering rightly, the bhikkhu would answer thus: 'Friend, without
abandoning that thing, one cannot realize Nibbana.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote975anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote975sym"><SUP>cmlxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >16.

mutual appreciation, without disputing, there arose mutual verbal
friction, domineering views, mental annoyance, bitterness, and
dejection. If the Recluse knew, would he censure that?' Answering
rightly, the bhikkhu would answer thus: 'While we were training ...
If the Recluse knew, he would censure that.'</P>
<P  >"'But,
friend, without abandoning that thing, can one realise Nibbana?'
Answering rightly, the bhikkhu would answer thus: [243] 'Friend,
without abandoning that thing, one cannot realise Nibbana.'</P>
<P  >17.
"If others should ask that bhikkhu thus: 'Was it the venerable
one who made those bhikkhus emerge from the unwholesome and
established them in the wholesome?' answering rightly, the bhikkhu
would answer thus: 'Here, friends, I went to the Blessed One. The
Blessed One taught me the Dhamma. Having heard that Dhamma, I spoke
to those bhikkhus. The bhikkhus heard that Dhamma, and they emerged
from the unwholesome and</P>
<P  >became
established in the wholesome.' Answering thus, the bhikkhu neither
exalts himself nor disparages others; he answers in accordance with
the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for
censure can be legitimately deduced from his assertion."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
