47. Vmamsaka Sutta - The Inquirer</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is an inquirer, not knowing how to gauge
another's mind,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote482anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote482sym"><SUP>cdlxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
should make an investigation of the Tathagata in order to find out
whether or not he is fully enlightened."</P>
<P  >3.
"Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided
by the Blessed One, have the Blessed One as their resort. It would be
good if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these words.
Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it."</P>
<P  >"Then
listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely to [318] what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >4.
"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is an inquirer, not knowing how to gauge
another's mind, should investigate the Tathagata with respect to
two kinds of states, states cognizable through the eye and through
the ear thus: 'Are there found in the Tathagata or not any defiled
states cognizable through the eye or through the ear?'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote483anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote483sym"><SUP>cdlxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
When he investigates him, he comes to know: 'No defiled states
cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the
Tathagata.'</P>
<P  >5.
"When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: 'Are
there found in the Tathagata or not any mixed states cognizable
through the eye or through the ear?'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote484anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote484sym"><SUP>cdlxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
When he investigates him, he comes to know: 'No mixed states
cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the
Tathagata.'</P>
<P  >6.
"When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: 'Are
there found in the Tathagata or not cleansed states cognizable
through the eye or through the ear?' When he investigates him, he
comes to know: 'Cleansed states cognizable through the eye or
through the ear are found in the Tathagata.'</P>
<P  >7.
"When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: 'Has
this venerable one attained this wholesome state over a long time or
did he attain it recently?' When he investigates him, he comes to
know: 'This venerable one has attained this wholesome state over a
long time; he did not attain it only recently.'</P>
<P  >8.
"When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: 'Has
this venerable one acquired renown and attained fame, so that the
dangers [connected with renown and fame] are found in him?' For,
bhikkhus, as long as a bhikkhu has not acquired renown and attained
fame, the dangers [connected with renown and fame] are not found in
him; but when he has acquired renown and attained fame, those dangers
are found in him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote485anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote485sym"><SUP>cdlxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
When he investigates him, he comes to know: 'This venerable one has
acquired renown and attained fame, but the dangers [connected with
renown and fame] are not found in him.'</P>
<P  >9.
"When he comes to know this, [319] he investigates him further
thus: 'Is this venerable one restrained without fear, not
restrained by fear, and does he avoid indulging in sensual pleasures
because he is without lust through the destruction of lust?' When
he investigates him, he comes to know: 'This venerable one is
restrained without fear, not restrained by fear, and he avoids
indulging in sensual pleasure because he is without lust through the
destruction of lust.'</P>
<P  >10.
"Now, bhikkhus, if others should ask that bhikkhu thus: 'What are
the venerable one's reasons and what is his evidence whereby he
says: "That venerable one is restrained without fear, not
restrained by fear, and he avoids indulging in sensual pleasures
because he is without lust through the destruction of lust"?' -
answering rightly, that bhikkhu would answer thus: 'Whether that
venerable one dwells in the Sangha or alone, while some there are
well-behaved and some are ill-behaved and some there teach a group,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote486anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote486sym"><SUP>cdlxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
while some here are seen concerned about material things and some are
unsullied by material things, still that venerable one does not
despise anyone because of that.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote487anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote487sym"><SUP>cdlxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
And I have heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own lips:
"I am restrained without fear, not restrained by fear, and I avoid
indulging in sensual pleasures because I am without lust through the
destruction of lust.'"</P>
<P  >11.
"The Tathagata, bhikkhus, should be questioned further about that
thus: 'Are there found in the Tathagata or not any defiled states
cognizable through the eye or through the ear?' The Tathagata would
answer thus: 'No defiled states cognizable through the eye or
through the ear are found in the Tathagata.'</P>
<P  >12.
"If asked, 'Are there found in the Tathagata or not any mixed
states cognizable through the eye or through the ear?' the
Tathagata would answer thus: 'No mixed states cognizable through
the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata.'</P>
<P  >13.
"If asked, 'Are there found in the Tathagata or not cleansed
states cognizable through the eye or through the ear?' the
Tathagata would answer thus: 'Cleansed states cognizable through
the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata. They are my
pathway and my domain, yet I do not identify with them.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote488anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote488sym"><SUP>cdlxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
"Bhikkhus, a disciple should approach the Teacher who speaks thus
in order to hear the Dhamma. The Teacher teaches him the Dhamma with
its higher and higher levels, with its more and more sublime levels,
with its dark and bright counterparts. As the Teacher teaches the
Dhamma to a bhikkhu in this way, through direct knowledge of a
certain teaching here in that Dhamma, [320] the bhikkhu comes to a
conclusion about the teachings.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote489anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote489sym"><SUP>cdlxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
He places confidence in the Teacher thus: 'The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha is practising the good way.'</P>
<P  >15.
"Now if others should ask that bhikkhu thus: 'What are the
venerable one's reasons and what is his evidence whereby he says,
"The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well
proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha is practising the good
way"?' - answering rightly, that bhikkhu would answer thus:
'Here, friends, I approached the Blessed One in order to hear the
Dhamma. The Blessed One taught me the Dhamma with its higher and
higher levels, with its more and more sublime levels, with its dark
and bright counterparts. As the Blessed One taught the Dhamma to me
in this way, through direct knowledge of a certain teaching here in
that Dhamma, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I placed
confidence in the Teacher thus: "The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha is practising the good way.'"</P>
<P  >16.
"Bhikkhus, when anyone's faith has been planted, rooted, and
established in the Tathagata through these reasons, terms, and
phrases, his faith is said to be supported by reasons, rooted in
vision, firm;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote490anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote490sym"><SUP>cdxc</SUP></A></SUP>
it is invincible by any recluse or brahmin or god or Mara or Brahma
or by anyone in the world. That is how, bhikkhus, there is an
investigation of the Tathagata in accordance with the Dhamma, and
that is how the Tathagata is well investigated in accordance with the
Dhamma."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
