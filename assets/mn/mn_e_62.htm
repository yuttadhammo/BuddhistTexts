62. Maharahulovada Sutta - The Greater Discourse of<BR>Advice to
Rahula</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote640anc" HREF="#sdendnote640sym"><SUP>dcxl</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's
Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. The venerable
Rahula also [421] dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe,
followed close behind the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >3.
Then the Blessed One looked back and addressed the venerable Rahula
thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote641anc" HREF="#sdendnote641sym"><SUP>dcxli</SUP></A></SUP>
"Rahula, any kind of material form whatever, whether past, future,
or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or
superior, far or near, all material form should be seen as it
actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am
not, this is not my self.'"</P>
<P  >"Only
material form, Blessed One? Only material form, Sublime One?"</P>
<P  >"Material
form, Rahula, and feeling, perception, formations, and
consciousness."</P>
<P  >4.
Then the venerable Rahula considered thus: "Who would go into the
town for alms today when personally admonished by the Blessed One?"
Thus he turned back and sat down at the root of a tree, folding his
legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness
in front of him.</P>
<P  >5.
The venerable Sariputta saw him sitting there and addressed him thus:
"Rahula, develop mindfulness of breathing. When mindfulness of
breathing is developed and cultivated, it is of great fruit and great
benefit."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote642anc" HREF="#sdendnote642sym"><SUP>dcxlii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Rahula rose from meditation
and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down
at one side and asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >7.
"Venerable sir, how is mindfulness of breathing developed and
cultivated, so that it is of great fruit and great benefit?"</P>
<H3 >(THE FOUR GREAT ELEMENTS)</H3>
<P  >8.
"Rahula,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote643anc" HREF="#sdendnote643sym"><SUP>dcxliii</SUP></A></SUP>
whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, and
clung-to, that is, head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,
sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen,
lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach,
feces, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is solid,
solidified, and clung-to: this is called the internal earth element.
Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element
are simply earth element. And that should be seen as it actually is
with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is
not my self.' [422] When one sees it thus as it actually is with
proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the earth element and
makes the mind dispassionate towards the earth element.</P>
<P  >9.
"What, Rahula, is the water element? The water element may be
either internal or external. What is the internal water element?
Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and
clung-to, that is, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears,
grease, spittle, snot, oil-of-the-joints, urine, or whatever else
internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and clungto: this
is called the internal water element. Now both the internal water
element and the external water element are simply water element. And
that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This
is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' When one sees it
thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted
with the water element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the
water element.</P>
<P  >10.
"What, Rahula, is the fire element? The fire element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal fire element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to, that
is, that by which one is warmed, ages, and is consumed, and that by
which what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets completely
digested, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is fire,
fiery, and clung-to: this is called the internal fire element. Now
both the internal fire element and the external fire element are
simply fire element. And that should be seen as it actually is with
proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not
my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the fire element and makes the
mind dispassionate towards the fire element.</P>
<P  >11.
"What, Rahula, is the air element? The air element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal air element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clung-to, that
is, up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the belly, winds in
the bowels, winds that course through the limbs, in-breath and
out-breath, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is
air, airy, and clung-to: this is called the internal air element. Now
both the internal air element and the external air element are simply
air element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper
wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my
self.' [423] When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the air element and makes the
mind dispassionate towards the air element.</P>
<P  >12.
"What, Rahula, is the space element?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote644anc" HREF="#sdendnote644sym"><SUP>dcxliv</SUP></A></SUP>
The space element may be either internal or external. What is the
internal space element? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is
space, spatial, and clung-to, that is, the holes of the ears, the
nostrils, the door of the mouth, and that [aperture] whereby what is
eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets swallowed, and where it
collects, and whereby it is excreted from below, or whatever else
internally, belonging to oneself, is space, spatial, and clung-to:
this is called the internal space element. Now both the internal
space element and the external space element are simply space
element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom
thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one
becomes disenchanted with the space element and makes the mind
dispassionate towards the space element.</P>

"Rahula, develop meditation that is like the earth; for when you
develop meditation that is like the earth, arisen agreeable and
disagreeable contacts will not invade your mind and remain.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote645anc" HREF="#sdendnote645sym"><SUP>dcxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as people throw clean things and dirty things, excrement, urine,
spittle, pus, and blood on the earth, and the earth is not horrified,

invade your mind and remain.</P>
<P  >15.
"Rahula, develop meditation that is like fire; for when you develop

like fire; for when you develop meditation that is like fire, arisen

<P  >16.

for when you develop meditation that is like air, arisen agreeable
and disagreeable contacts will not invade your mind and remain.</P>
<P  >17.
"Rahula, develop meditation that is like space; for when you
develop meditation that is like space, arisen agreeable and
disagreeable contacts will not invade your mind and remain. Just as

"Rahula, develop meditation on mindfulness of breathing. When
mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is of great
fruit and great benefit. And how is mindfulness of breathing
developed and cultivated, so that it is of great fruit and great
benefit?</P>
<P  >25.
"Here, Rahula, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a
tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise,
set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him, ever
mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote646anc" HREF="#sdendnote646sym"><SUP>dcxlvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >26.
"Breathing in long, he understands: 'I breathe in long'; or
breathing out long, he understands: 'I breathe out long.'
Breathing in short, he understands: 'I breathe in short'; or
breathing out short, he understands: 'I breathe out short.' He

<P  >30.
"Rahula, that is how mindfulness of breathing is developed and
cultivated, so that it is of great fruit and great benefit. When
mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated in this way,
[426] even the final in-breaths and out-breaths are known as they
cease, not unknown."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote647anc" HREF="#sdendnote647sym"><SUP>dcxlvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Rahula was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
