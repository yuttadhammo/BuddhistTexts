51. Kandaraka Sutta - To Kandaraka</H2>
<P  >[339]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Campa on the banks of the Gaggara Lake with a large Sangha of
bhikkhus. Then Pessa, the elephant driver's son, and Kandaraka the
wanderer went to the Blessed One. Pessa, after paying homage to the
Blessed One, sat down at one side, while Kandaraka exchanged
greetings with the Blessed One, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he stood at one side.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote538anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote538sym"><SUP>dxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Standing there, he surveyed the Sangha of bhikkhus sitting in
complete silence,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote539anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote539sym"><SUP>dxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
and then he said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >2.
"It is wonderful, Master Gotama, it is marvellous how the Sangha of
bhikkhus has been led to practise the right way by Master Gotama.
Those who were Blessed Ones, accomplished and fully enlightened in
the past, at most only led the Sangha of bhikkhus to practise the
right way as is done by Master Gotama now. And those who will be
Blessed Ones, accomplished and fully enlightened in the future, at
most will only lead the Sangha of bhikkhus to practise the right way
as is done by Master Gotama now."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote540anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote540sym"><SUP>dxl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
"So it is, Kandaraka, so it is! Those who were Blessed Ones,
accomplished and fully enlightened in the past, at most only led the
Sangha of bhikkhus to practise the right way as is done by me now.
And those who will be Blessed Ones, accomplished and fully
enlightened in the future, at most will only lead the Sangha of
bhikkhus to practise the right way as is done by me now.</P>
<P  >"Kandaraka,
in this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who are arahants with
taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be
done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the
fetters of being, and who are completely liberated through final
knowledge. In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus in higher
training, of constant virtue, living a life of constant virtue,
sagacious, living a life of constant sagacity. They abide with their
minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote541anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote541sym"><SUP>dxli</SUP></A></SUP>
What four? Here, Kandaraka, [340] a bhikkhu abides contemplating the
body as a body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating
feelings as feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put
away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating
mind as mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating
mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful,
having put away covetousness and grief for the world."</P>
<P  >4.
When this was said, Pessa, the elephant driver's son, said: "It
is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous how well the four
foundations of mindfulness have been made known by the Blessed One:
for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and
lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the
attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbana. From time
to time, venerable sir, we white-clothed lay people also abide with
our minds well established in these four foundations of mindfulness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote542anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote542sym"><SUP>dxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, venerable sir, we abide contemplating the body as a body ...
feelings as feelings ... mind as mind ... mind-objects as
mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world. It is wonderful, venerable sir,
it is marvellous how amid man's tangle, corruption, and deceptions,
the Blessed One knows the welfare and harm of beings. For humankind
is a tangle but the animal is open enough. Venerable sir, I can drive
an elephant to be tamed, and in the time it takes to make a trip back
and forth in Campa, that elephant will show every kind of deception,
duplicity, crookedness, and fraud [he is capable of].<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote543anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote543sym"><SUP>dxliii</SUP></A></SUP>
But those who are called our slaves, messengers, and servants behave
in one way with the body, in another way by speech, while their minds
work in still another way. It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is
marvellous how amid man's tangle, corruption, and deceptions, the
Blessed One knows the welfare and harm of beings. For humankind is a
tangle but the animal is open enough."</P>
<P  >5.
"So it is, Pessa, so it is! [341] Humankind is a tangle but the
animal is open enough. Pessa, there are four kinds of persons to be
found existing in the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote544anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote544sym"><SUP>dxliv</SUP></A></SUP>
What four? Here a certain kind of person torments himself and pursues
the practice of torturing himself. Here a certain kind of person
torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others. Here a
certain kind of person torments himself and pursues the practice of
torturing himself, and he also torments others and pursues the
practice of torturing others. Here a certain kind of person does not
torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself, and he
does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others.
Since he torments neither himself nor others, he is here and now
hungerless, extinguished, and cooled, and he abides experiencing
bliss, having himself become holy.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote545anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote545sym"><SUP>dxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
Which of these four kinds of persons satisfies your mind, Pessa?"</P>
<P  >"The
first three do not satisfy my mind, venerable sir, but the last one
satisfies my mind."</P>
<P  >6.
"But, Pessa, why don't the first three kinds of persons satisfy
your mind?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, the kind of person who torments himself and pursues the practice
of torturing himself, torments and tortures himself though he desires
pleasure and recoils from pain; that is why this kind of person does
not satisfy my mind. And the kind of person who torments others and
pursues the practice of torturing others, torments and tortures
others who desire pleasure and recoil from pain; that is why this
kind of person does not satisfy my mind. And the kind of person who
torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself, and
who also torments others and pursues the practice of torturing
others, torments and tortures himself and others, both of whom desire
pleasure and recoil from pain; that is why this kind of person does
not satisfy my mind. [342] But the kind of person who does not
torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who
does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others;
who, since he torments neither himself nor others, is here and now
hungerless, extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing bliss,
having himself become holy - he does not torment and torture either
himself or others, both of whom desire pleasure and recoil from pain.
That is why this kind of person satisfies my mind. And now, venerable
sir, we depart. We are busy and have much to do."</P>
<P  >"Now
is the time, Pessa, to do as you think fit."</P>
<P  >Then
Pessa, the elephant driver's son, having delighted and rejoiced in
the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.</P>
<P  >7.
Soon after he had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:
"Bhikkhus, Pessa, the elephant driver's son, is wise, he has
great wisdom. If he had sat a while longer until I had expounded for
him in detail these four kinds of persons, he would have greatly
benefited. Still he has already greatly benefited even as it is."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote546anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote546sym"><SUP>dxlvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"This
is the time, Blessed One, this is the time, Sublime One, for the
Blessed One to expound in detail these four kinds of persons. Having
heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it."</P>
<P  >"Then,
bhikkhus, listen and attend closely to what I shall say." "Yes,
venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >8.
"Bhikkhus, what kind of person torments himself and pursues the
practice of torturing himself?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote547anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote547sym"><SUP>dxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here a certain person goes naked, rejecting conventions, licking his
hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when asked; he does not
accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a
meal; he receives nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across a
threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating together,
from a pregnant woman, from a woman giving suck, from a woman lying
with a man, from where food is advertised to be distributed, from
where a dog is waiting, from where flies are buzzing; he accepts no
fish or meat, he drinks no liquor, wine, or fermented brew. He keeps
to one house, to one morsel; he keeps to two houses to two morsels; ...
he keeps to seven houses, to seven morsels. He lives on one saucerful
a day, on two saucerfuls a day ... on seven saucerfuls a day. He
takes food once a day, [343] once every two days ... once every seven
days, and so on up to once every fortnight; he dwells pursuing the
practice of taking food at stated intervals. He is an eater of greens
or millet or wild rice or hide-parings or moss or ricebran or
rice-scum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung. He lives on forest
roots and fruits, he feeds on fallen fruits. He clothes himself in
hemp, in hemp mixed cloth, in shrouds, in refuse rags, in tree bark,
in antelope hide, in strips of antelope hide, in kusa-grass fabric,
in bark fabric, in wood-shavings fabric, in head-hair wool, in animal
wool, in owls' wings. He is one who pulls out hair and beard,
pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard. He is one who
stands continuously, rejecting seats. He is one who squats
continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting position. He is
one who uses a mattress of spikes; he makes a mattress of spikes his
bed. He dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times
daily including the evening. Thus in such a variety of ways he dwells
pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body. This is
called the kind of person who torments himself and pursues the
practice of torturing himself.</P>
<P  >9.
"What kind of person, bhikkhus, torments others and pursues the
practice of torturing others? Here a certain person is a butcher of
sheep, a butcher of pigs, a fowler, a trapper of wild beasts, a
hunter, a fisherman, a thief, an executioner, a prison warden, or one
who follows any other such bloody occupation. This is called the kind
of person who torments others and pursues the practice of torturing
others.</P>
<P  >10.
"What kind of person, bhikkhus, torments himself and pursues the
practice of torturing himself and also torments others and pursues
the practice of torturing others? Here some person is a head-anointed
noble king or a well-to-do Brahmin.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote548anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote548sym"><SUP>dxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Having had a new sacrificial temple built to the east of the city,
and having shaved off his hair and beard, dressed himself in rough
hide, and greased his body with ghee and oil, scratching his back
with a deer's horn, he enters the sacrificial temple together with
his chief queen and his brahmin high priest. There he lies down on
the bare ground with the grass on it. The king lives on the milk in
the first teat of a cow with a calf of the same colour [344] while
the chief queen lives on the milk in the second teat and the brahmin
high priest lives on the milk in the third teat; the milk in the
fourth teat they pour onto the fire, and the calf lives on what is
left. He says thus: 'Let so many bulls be slaughtered for
sacrifice, let so many bullocks be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so
many heifers be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many goats be
slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many sheep be slaughtered for
sacrifice, let so many trees be felled for the sacrificial posts, let
so much grass be cut for the sacrificial grass.' And then his
slaves, messengers, and servants make preparations, weeping with
tearful faces, being spurred on by threats of punishment and by fear.
This is called the kind of person who torments himself and pursues
the practice of torturing himself and who torments others and pursues
the practice of torturing others.</P>
<P  >11.
"What kind of person, bhikkhus, does not torment himself or pursue
the practice of torturing himself and does not torment others or
pursue the practice of tormenting others - the one who, since he
torments neither himself nor others, is here and now hungerless,
extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing bliss, having
himself become holy?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote549anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote549sym"><SUP>dxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
"Here, bhikkhus, a Tathagata appears in the world, accomplished,
fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime,
knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher
of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with
its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this generation with its
recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, which he has
himself realised by direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma good in
the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the
right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is
utterly perfect and pure.</P>
<P  >13.
"A householder or householder's son or one born in some other
clan hears that Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in
the Tathagata. Possessing that faith, he considers thus: 'Household
life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not
easy, while living in a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect
and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard,
put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into
homelessness.' On a later occasion, abandoning a small or a large
fortune, [345] abandoning a small or a large circle of relatives, he
shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the yellow robe, and goes
forth from the home life into homelessness.</P>
<P  >14.
"Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus' training and
way of life, abandoning the killing of living beings, he abstains
from killing living beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gentle
and kindly, he abides compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning
the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not
given; taking only what is given, expecting only what is given, by
not stealing he abides in purity. Abandoning incelibacy, he observes
celibacy, living apart, abstaining from the vulgar practice of sexual
intercourse.</P>
<P  >"Abandoning
false speech, he abstains from false speech; he speaks truth, adheres
to truth, is trustworthy and reliable, one who is no deceiver of the
world. Abandoning malicious speech, he abstains from malicious
speech; he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order
to divide [those people] from these, nor does he repeat to these
people what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people]
from those; thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a
promoter of friendships, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord,
delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord.
Abandoning harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks
such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to
the heart, are courteous, desired by many and agreeable to many.
Abandoning gossip, he abstains from gossip; he speaks at the right
time, speaks what is fact, speaks on what is good, speaks on the
Dhamma and the Discipline; at the right time he speaks such words as
are worth recording, reasonable, moderate, and beneficial.</P>
<P  >"He
abstains from injuring seeds and plants. He practises eating only in
one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and outside the
proper time. He abstains from dancing, singing, music, and theatrical
shows. He abstains from wearing garlands, smartening himself with
scent, and embellishing himself with unguents. He abstains from high
and large couches. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He
abstains from accepting raw grain. He abstains from accepting raw
meat. He abstains from accepting women and girls. He abstains from
accepting men and women slaves. He abstains from accepting goats and
sheep. He abstains from accepting fowl and pigs. He abstains from
accepting elephants, cattle, horses, and mares. He abstains from
accepting fields and land. He abstains from going on errands and
running messages. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstains
from false weights, false metals, and false measures. [346] He
abstains from cheating, deceiving, defrauding, and trickery. He
abstains from wounding, murdering, binding, brigandage, plunder, and
violence.</P>
<P  >15.
"He becomes content with robes to protect his body and with
almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out
taking only these with him. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies
with its wings as its only burden, so too, the bhikkhu becomes
content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain
his stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with
him. Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue, he experiences within
himself a bliss that is blameless.</P>
<P  >16.
"On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its signs and
features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil
unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he
practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he
undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with
the ear ... On smelling an odour with the nose ... On tasting a
flavour with the tongue ... On touching a tangible with the body ...
On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, he does not grasp at its
signs and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unguarded,
evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him,
he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the, mind faculty,
he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. Possessing this
noble restraint of the faculties, he experiences within himself a
bliss that is unsullied.</P>
<P  >17.
"He becomes one who acts in full awareness when going forward and
returning; who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking
away; who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his
limbs; who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying
his outer robe and bowl; who acts in full awareness when eating,
drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts in full awareness
when defecating and urinating; who acts in full awareness when
walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and
keeping silent.</P>
<P  >18.
"Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue, and this noble
restraint of the faculties, and possessing this noble mindfulness and
full awareness, he resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest,
the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel
ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.</P>
<P  >19.
"On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down,
folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing
mindfulness before him. [347] Abandoning covetousness for the world,
he abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind
from covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a
mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living
beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning
sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of
light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and
torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated
with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness
and remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt,
unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.</P>
<P  >20.
"Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</P>
<P  >21.
"Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he
enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has selfconfidence
and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of concentration.</P>
<P  >22.
"Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, he abides in
equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with
the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on account of
which noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abiding who has
equanimity and is mindful.'</P>
<P  >23.
"Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, he enters upon and abides in
the fourth jhana, which has neither-painnor-pleasure and purity of
mindfulness due to equanimity.</P>
<P  >24.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one
birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten
births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a
hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many
aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of worldexpansion, many aeons
of world-contraction and expansion: 'There I was so named, of such
a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my
experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away
from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of
such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my
experience of pleasure and pain, [348] such my life-term; and passing
away from there, I reappeared here.' Thus with their aspects and
particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >25.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing,
inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. He
understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus:
'These worthy beings who were ill-conducted in body, speech, and
mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to
wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after
death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad
destination, in perdition, even in hell; but these worthy beings who
were wellconducted in body, speech, and mind, not revilers of noble
ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in their
actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared
in a good destination, even in the heavenly world.' Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions.</P>
<P  >26.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. He understands as it actually is: 'This is suffering';
he understands as it actually is: 'This is the origin of
suffering'; he understands as it actually is: 'This is the
cessation of suffering'; he understands as it actually is: 'This
is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' He understands
as it actually is: 'These are the taints'; he understands as it
actually is: 'This is the origin of the taints'; he understands
as it actually is: 'This is the cessation of the taints'; he
understands as it actually is: 'This is the way leading to the
cessation of the taints.'</P>
<P  >27.
"When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'It is
liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.'</P>
<P  >28.
"This, bhikkhus, is called the kind of person who does not torment
himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not
torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others [349] - the
one who, since he torments neither himself nor others, is here and
now hungerless, extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing
bliss, having himself become holy."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
