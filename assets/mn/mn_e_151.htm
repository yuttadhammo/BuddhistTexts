151. Pindapataparisuddhi Sutta - The Purification of Almsfood</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Then, when
it was evening, the venerable Sariputta rose from meditation and went
to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one
side. The Blessed One then said to him: [294]</P>
<P  >2.
"Sariputta, your faculties are clear. The colour of your skin is
pure and bright. What abiding do you often abide in now, Sariputta?"</P>
<P  >"Now,
venerable sir, I often abide in voidness."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1347anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1347sym"><SUP>mcccxlvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Good,
good, Sariputta! Now, indeed, you often abide in the abiding of a
great man. For this is the abiding of a great man, namely, voidness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1348anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1348sym"><SUP>mcccxlviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
"So, Sariputta, if a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I now often abide
in voidness,' he should consider thus: 'On the path by which I
went to the village for alms, or in the place where I wandered for
alms, or on the path by which I returned from the almsround, was
there any desire, lust, hate, delusion, or aversion in my mind
regarding forms cognizable by the eye?'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1349anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1349sym"><SUP>mcccxlix</SUP></A></SUP>
If, by so reviewing, he knows thus: 'On the path by which I went to
the village for alms, or in the place where I wandered for alms, or
on the path by which I returned from the almsround, there was desire,
lust, hate, delusion, or aversion in my mind regarding forms
cognizable by the eye,' then he should make an effort to abandon
those evil unwholesome states. But if, by reviewing, he knows thus:
'On the path by which I went to the village for alms, and in the
place where I wandered for alms, and on the path by which I returned
from the almsround, there was no desire, lust, hate, delusion, or
aversion in my mind regarding forms cognizable by the eye,' then he
can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome states.</P>
<P  >4-8.
"Again, Sariputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: 'On the path
by which I went to the village for alms, or in the place where I
wandered for alms, or on the path by which I returned from the
alm.sround, was there any desire, lust, hate, delusion, or aversion
in my mind regarding sounds cognizable by the ear?.. .regarding
odours cognizable by the nose?.. .regarding flavours cognizable by
the tongue? ... regarding tangibles cognizable by the body? ...
regarding mind-objects cognizable by the mind?' [295] If, by
reviewing, he knows thus: 'On the path by which I went to the
village for alms ... there was desire, lust, hate, delusion, or
aversion in my mind regarding mind-objects cognizable by the mind,'
then he should make an effort to abandon those evil unwholesome
states. But if, by reviewing, he knows thus: 'On the path by which
I went to the village for alms ... there was no desire, lust, hate,
delusion, or aversion in my mind regarding mind-objects cognizable by
the mind,' then he can abide happy and glad, training day and night
in wholesome states.</P>
<P  >9.
"Again, Sariputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: 'Are the five
cords of sensual pleasure abandoned in me?'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1350anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1350sym"><SUP>mcccl</SUP></A></SUP>
If, by reviewing, he knows thus: 'The five cords of sensual
pleasure are not abandoned in me,' then he should make an effort to
abandon those five cords of sensual pleasure. But if, by reviewing,
he knows thus: 'The five cords of sensual pleasure are abandoned in
me,' then he can abide happy and glad, training day and night in
wholesome states.</P>
<P  >10.
"Again, Sariputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: 'Are the five
hindrances abandoned in me?' If, by reviewing, he knows thus: 'The
five hindrances are not abandoned in me,' then he should make an
effort to abandon those five hindrances. But if, by reviewing, he
knows thus: 'The five hindrances are abandoned in me,' then he
can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome states.</P>
<P  >11.
"Again, Sariputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: 'Are the five
aggregates affected by clinging fully understood by me?' If, by
reviewing, he knows thus: 'The five aggregates affected by clinging
are not fully understood by me,' then he should make an effort to
fully understand those five aggregates affected by clinging. But if,
by reviewing, [296] he knows thus: 'The five aggregates affected by
clinging are fully understood by me,' then he can abide happy and
glad, training day and night in wholesome states.</P>
<P  >12.
"Again, Sariputta, a. bhikkhu should consider thus: 'Are the four
foundations of mindfulness developed in me?' If, by reviewing, he
knows thus: 'The four foundations of mindfulness are not developed
in me,' then he should make an effort to develop those four
foundations of mindfulness. But if, by reviewing, he knows thus: 'The
four foundations of mindfulness are developed in me,' then he can
abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome states.</P>
<P  >13-19.
"Again, Sariputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: 'Are the four
right kinds of striving developed in me? ... Are the four bases for
spiritual power developed in me? ... Are the five faculties developed
in me? ... Are the five powers developed in me? ... Are the seven
enlightenment factors developed in me? ... Is the Noble Eightfold
Path developed in me? [297] ... Are serenity and insight developed in
me?' If, by reviewing, he knows thus: 'Serenity and insight are
not developed in me,' then he should make an effort to develop
them. But if, by reviewing, he knows thus: 'Serenity and insight
are developed in me,' then he can abide happy and glad, training
day and night in wholesome states.</P>
<P  >20.
"Again, Sariputta, a bhikkhu should consider thus: 'Are true
knowledge and deliverance realised by me?' If, by reviewing, he
knows thus: 'True knowledge and deliverance are not realised by
me,' then he should make an effort to realise true knowledge and
deliverance. But if, by reviewing, he knows thus: 'True knowledge
and deliverance are realised by me,' then he can abide happy and
glad, training day and night in wholesome states.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1351anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1351sym"><SUP>mcccli</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >21.
"Sariputta, whatever recluses and brahmins in the past have
purified their almsfood have all done so by repeatedly reviewing
thus. Whatever recluses and brahmins in the future will purify their
almsfood will all do so by repeatedly reviewing thus. Whatever
recluses and brahmins in the present are purifying their almsfood are
all doing so by repeatedly reviewing thus. Therefore, Sariputta, you
should train thus: 'We will purify our almsfood by repeatedly
reviewing thus.'"</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Sariputta was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
