17. Vanapattha Sutta - Jungle Thickets</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on jungle thickets. Listen
and attend closely to what I shall say." - "Yes, venerable sir,"
the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives in some jungle thicket.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote223anc" HREF="#sdendnote223sym"><SUP>ccxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
While he is living there his unestablished mindfulness does not
become established, his unconcentrated mind does not become
concentrated, his undestroyed taints do not come to destruction, he
does not attain the unattained supreme security from bondage; and
also the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth
- robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites - are hard
to come by. The bhikkhu [1051 should consider thus: 'I am living in
this jungle thicket. While I am living here my unestablished
mindfulness does not become established … I do not attain the
unattained supreme security from bondage; and also the requisites of
life … are hard to come by.' That bhikkhu should depart from that
jungle thicket that very night or that very day; he should not
continue living there.</P>
<P  >4.
"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives in some jungle thicket. While he
is living there his unestablished mindfulness does not become
established, his unconcentrated mind does not become concentrated,
his undestroyed taints do not come to destruction, he does not attain
the unattained supreme security from bondage; yet the requisites of
life that should be obtained by one gone forth … are easy to come
by. The bhikkhu should consider thus: 'I am living in this jungle
thicket. While I am living here my unestablished mindfulness does not
become established … I do not attain the unattained supreme
security from bondage; yet the requisites of life that should be
obtained by one gone forth … are easy to come by. However, I did
not go forth from the home life into homelessness for the sake of
robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites. Moreover,
while I am living here my unestablished mindfulness does not become
established … I do not attain the unattained supreme security from
bondage.' Having reflected thus, that bhikkhu should depart from
that jungle thicket; he should not continue living there.</P>
<P  >5.
"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives in some jungle thicket. While he
is living there his unestablished mindfulness becomes established,
his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated, his undestroyed taints
come to destruction, he attains the unattained supreme security from
bondage; yet the requisites of life that should be obtained by one
gone forth … are hard to come by. The bhikkhu should consider thus:
[106] 'I am living in this jungle thicket. While I am living here
my unestablished mindfulness has become established … I have
attained the unattained supreme security from bondage; yet the
requisites of life … are hard to come by. However, I did not go
forth from the home life into homelessness for the sake of robes,
almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites. Moreover, while I
am living here my unestablished mindfulness has become established …
I have attained the unattained supreme security from bondage.'
Having reflected thus, that bhikkhu should continue living in that
jungle thicket; he should not depart.</P>

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives in some jungle thicket. While he
is living there his unestablished mindfulness becomes established,
his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated, his undestroyed taints
come to destruction, he attains the unattained supreme security from
bondage; and also the requisites of life that should be obtained by
one gone forth - robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal
requisites - are easy to come by. The bhikkhu should consider thus:
'I am living in this jungle thicket. While I am living here my
unestablished mindfulness has become established … I have attained
the unattained supreme security from bondage; and also the requisites
of life … are easy to come by.' That bhikkhu should continue
living in that jungle thicket as long as life lasts; he should not
depart.</P>

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain

"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain
person … (as in §6) [108] … That bhikkhu should continue
following that person as long as life lasts; he should not depart

<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
