75. Magandiya Sutta - To Magandiya</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Kuru country at a town of the Kurus named Kammasadhamma, on a spread
of grass in the fire chamber of a brahmin belonging to the Bharadvaja
clan.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Kammasadhamma for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Kammasadhamma and had returned from his
almsround, after his meal he went to a certain grove for the day's
abiding. Having entered the grove, he sat down at the root of a tree
for the day's abiding. [502]</P>
<P  >3.
Then the wanderer Magandiya, while walking and wandering for
exercise, went to the fire chamber of the brahmin belonging to the
Bharadvaja clan. There he saw a spread of grass prepared and asked
the brahmin: "For whom has this spread of grass been prepared in
Master Bharadvaja's fire chamber? It seems like a recluse's bed."</P>
<P  >4.
"Master Magandiya, there is the recluse Gotama, the son of the
Sakyans, who went forth from a Sakyan clan. Now a good report of
Master Gotama has been spread to this effect: 'That Blessed One is
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.' This
bed has been prepared for that Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >5.
"Indeed, Master Bharadvaja, it is an ill sight we see when we see
the bed of that destroyer of growth,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote740anc" HREF="#sdendnote740sym"><SUP>dccxl</SUP></A></SUP>
Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"Be
careful what you say, Magandiya, be careful what you say! Many
learned nobles, learned brahmins, learned householders, and learned
recluses have full confidence in Master</P>
<P  >Gotama,
and have been disciplined by him in the noble true way, in the Dhamma
that is wholesome."</P>
<P  >"Master
Bharadvaja, even if we saw that Master Gotama face to face, we would
tell him to his face: 'The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of
growth.' Why is that? Because that is recorded in our scriptures."</P>
<P  >"If
Master Magandiya has no objection, may I tell this to Master Gotama?"</P>
<P  >"Let
Master Bharadvaja be at ease. Tell him just what I have said."</P>
<P  >6.
Meanwhile, with the divine ear, which is purified and surpasses the
human, the Blessed One heard this conversation between the brahmin of
the Bharadvaja clan and the wanderer Magandiya. Then, when it was
evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation, went to the brahmin's
fire chamber, and sat down on the spread of grass made ready. Then
the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One asked him:
"Bharadvaja, did you have any conversation with the wanderer
Magandiya [503] about this spread of grass?"</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin, awestruck and with his hair standing on
end, replied: "We wanted to tell Master Gotama about that very
thing, but Master Gotama has anticipated us."</P>
<P  >7.
But this discussion between the Blessed One and the Brahmin of the
Bharadvaja clan was left unfinished, for then the wanderer Magandiya,
while walking and wandering for exercise, came to the brahmin's
fire chamber and went up to the Blessed One. He exchanged greetings
with the Blessed One, and when this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One said to him:</P>
<P  >8.
"Magandiya, the eye delights in forms, takes delight in forms,
rejoices in forms; that has been tamed by the Tathagata, guarded,
protected, and restrained, and he teaches the Dhamma for its
restraint. Was it with reference to this that you said: 'The
recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth'?"</P>
<P  >"It
was with reference to this, Master Gotama, that I said: 'The
recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth.' Why is that? Because that
is recorded in our scriptures."</P>
<P  >"The
ear delights in sound … The nose delights in odours … The tongue
delights in flavours … The body delights in tangibles … The mind
delights in mind-objects, takes delight in mind-objects, rejoices in
mind-objects; that has been tamed by the Tathagata, guarded,
protected, and restrained, and he teaches the Dhamma for its
restraint. Was it with reference to this that you said: 'The
recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth'?"</P>
<P  >"It
was with reference to this, Master Gotama, that I said: 'The
recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth.' Why is that? Because that
is recorded in our scriptures."</P>
<P  >9.
"What do you think, Magandiya? Here someone [504] may have formerly
enjoyed himself with forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. On a later occasion, having understood as they
actually are the origin, the disappearance, the gratification, the
danger, and the escape in the case of forms, he might abandon craving
for forms, remove fever for forms, and abide without thirst, with a
mind inwardly at peace. What would you say to him, Magandiya?" -
"Nothing, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Magandiya? Here someone may have formerly enjoyed
himself with sounds cognizable by the ear … with odours cognizable
by the nose … with flavours cognizable by the tongue … with
tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. On a later occasion, having understood as they
actually are the origin, the disappearance, the gratification, the
danger, and the escape in the case of tangibles, he might abandon
craving for tangibles, remove fever for tangibles, and abide without
thirst, with a mind inwardly at peace. What would you say to him,
Magandiya?" - "Nothing, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >10.
"Magandiya, formerly when I lived the home life, I enjoyed myself,
provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure: with
forms cognizable by the eye … with sounds cognizable by the ear …
with odours cognizable by the nose … with flavours cognizable by
the tongue … with tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished
for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire
and provocative of lust. I had three palaces, one for the rainy
season, one for the winter, and one for the summer. I lived in the
rains' palace for the four months of the rainy season, enjoying
myself with musicians who were all female, and I did not go down to
the lower palace.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote741anc" HREF="#sdendnote741sym"><SUP>dccxli</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"On
a later occasion, having understood as they actually are the origin,
the disappearance, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in
the case of sensual pleasures, I abandoned craving for sensual
pleasures, I removed fever for sensual pleasures, and I abide without
thirst, with a mind inwardly at peace. I see other beings who are not
free from lust for sensual pleasures being devoured by craving for
sensual pleasures, burning with fever for sensual pleasures,
indulging in sensual pleasures, and I do not envy them, nor do I
delight therein. Why is that? Because there is, Magandiya, a delight
apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, [505]
which surpasses divine bliss.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote742anc" HREF="#sdendnote742sym"><SUP>dccxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
Since I take delight in that, I do not envy what is inferior, nor do
I delight therein.</P>
<P  >11.
"Suppose, Magandiya, a householder or a householder's son was
rich, with great wealth and property, and being provided and endowed
with the five cords of sensual pleasure, he might enjoy himself with
forms cognizable by the eye … with sounds cognizable by the ear …
with odours cognizable by the nose … with flavours cognizable by
the tongue … with tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished
for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire
and provocative of lust. Having conducted himself well in body,
speech, and mind, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he
might reappear in a happy destination, in the heavenly world in the
retinue of the gods of the Thirty-three; and there, surrounded by a
group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove, he would enjoy himself,
provided and endowed with the five cords of divine sensual pleasure.
Suppose he saw a householder or a householder's son enjoying
himself, provided and endowed with the five cords of [human] sensual
pleasure. What do you think, Magandiya? Would that young god
surrounded by the group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove, enjoying
himself, provided and endowed with the five cords of divine sensual
pleasure, envy the householder or the householder's son for the
five cords of human sensual pleasure or would he return to human
sensual pleasures?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Why not? Because heavenly sensual pleasures are more
excellent and sublime than human sensual pleasures."</P>
<P  >12.
"So too, Magandiya, formerly when I lived the home life, I enjoyed
myself, provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure:
with forms cognizable by the eye … with tangibles cognizable by the
body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected
with sensual desire and provocative of lust. On a later occasion,
having understood as they actually are the gratification, the danger,
and the escape in the case of sensual pleasures, I abandoned craving
for sensual pleasures, I removed fever for sensual pleasures, and I
abide without thirst, with a mind inwardly at peace. I see other
beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures being
devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with fever for
sensual pleasures, [506] indulging in sensual pleasures, and I do not
envy them nor do I delight therein. Why is that? Because there is,
Magandiya, a delight apart from sensual pleasures, apart from
unwholesome states, which surpasses divine bliss. Since I take
delight in that, I do not envy what is inferior, nor do I delight
therein.</P>
<P  >13.
"Suppose, Magandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on
his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the
openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a
burning charcoal pit. Then his friends and companions, his kinsmen
and relatives, would bring a physician to treat him. The physician
would make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine the man
would be cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy,
independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. Then he
might see another leper with sores and blisters on his limbs, being
devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his
wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a burning charcoal
pit. What do you think, Magandiya? Would that man envy that leper for
his burning charcoal pit or his use of medicine?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Why is that? Because when there is sickness, medicine
has to be made, and when there is no sickness medicine does not have
to be made."</P>
<P  >14.
"So too, Magandiya, formerly when I lived the home life … (as in
§12) … Since I take delight in that, I do not envy what is
inferior, nor do I delight therein. [507]</P>
<P  >15.
"Suppose, Magandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on
his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the
openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a
burning charcoal pit. Then his friends and companions, his kinsmen
and relatives, brought a physician to treat him. The physician would
make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine the man would be
cured of his leprosy and would become well and happy, independent,
master of himself, able to go where he likes. Then two strong men
would seize him by both arms and drag him towards a burning charcoal
pit. What do you think, Magandiya? Would that man twist his body this
way and that?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
Master Gotama. Why is that? Because that fire is indeed painful to
touch, hot, and scorching."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Magandiya? Is it only now that that fire is painful to
touch, hot, and scorching, or previously too was that fire painful to
touch, hot, and scorching?"</P>
<P  >"Master
Gotama, that fire is now painful to touch, hot, and scorching, and
previously too that fire was painful to touch, hot, and scorching.
For when that man was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs,
being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his
wounds with his nails, his faculties were impaired; thus, though the
fire was actually painful to touch, he mistakenly perceived it as
pleasant."</P>
<P  >16.
"So too, Magandiya, in the past sensual pleasures were painful to
touch, hot, and scorching; in the future sensual pleasures will be
painful to touch, hot, and scorching; and now at present sensual
pleasures are painful to touch, hot, and scorching. But these beings
who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, who are devoured by
craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with fever for sensual
pleasures, have faculties that are impaired; thus, though sensual
pleasures are actually painful to touch, they acquire a mistaken
perception of them as pleasant.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote743anc" HREF="#sdendnote743sym"><SUP>dccxliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >17.
"Suppose, Magandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on
his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the
openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a
burning charcoal pit; the more he scratches the scabs and cauterises
his body, [508] the fouler, more evilsmelling and more infected the
openings of his wounds would become, yet he would find a certain
measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in scratching the openings of
his wounds. So too, Magandiya, beings who are not free from lust for
sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures,
who burn with fever for sensual pleasures, still indulge in sensual</P>
<P  >pleasures;
the more such beings indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their
craving for sensual pleasures increases and the more they are burned
by their fever for sensual pleasures, yet they find a certain measure
of satisfaction and enjoyment in dependence on the five cords of
sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >18.
"What do you think, Magandiya? Have you ever seen or heard of a
king or a king's minister enjoying himself, provided and endowed
with the five cords of sensual pleasure who, without abandoning
craving for sensual pleasures, without removing fever for sensual
pleasures, was able to abide free from thirst, with a mind inwardly
at peace, or who is able or who will be able to so abide?" - "No,
Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"Good,
Magandiya. I too have never seen or heard of a king or a king's
minister enjoying himself, provided and endowed with the five cords
of sensual pleasure who, without abandoning craving for sensual
pleasures, without removing fever for sensual pleasures, was able to
abide free from thirst, with a mind inwardly at peace, or who is able
or who will be able to so abide. On the contrary, Magandiya, those
recluses or brahmins who abided or abide or will abide free from
thirst, with a mind inwardly at peace, all do so after having
understood as they actually are the origin, the disappearance, the
gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of sensual
pleasures, and it is after abandoning craving for sensual pleasures
and removing fever for sensual pleasures that they abided or abide or
will abide free from thirst, with a mind inwardly at peace."</P>
<P  >19.
Then at that point the Blessed One uttered this exclamation:</P>
<P >
"The greatest of all gains is health,</P>
<P >
Nibbana is the greatest bliss,</P>
<P >
The eightfold path is the best of paths</P>
<P >
For it leads safely to the Deathless."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the wanderer Magandiya said to the Blessed One: "It
is wonderful, Master Gotama, it is marvellous how well that has been
expressed by Master Gotama: [509]</P>
<P >
'The greatest of all gains is health,</P>
<P >
Nibbana is the greatest bliss.'</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >We
too have heard this said by earlier wanderers in the tradition of the
teachers, and it agrees, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"But,
Magandiya, when you heard that said by earlier wanderers in the
tradition of the teachers, what is that health, what is that
Nibbana?"</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the wanderer Magandiya rubbed his limbs with his hands
and said: "This is that health, Master Gotama, this is that
Nibbana; for I am now healthy and happy and nothing afflicts me."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote744anc" HREF="#sdendnote744sym"><SUP>dccxliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >20.
"Magandiya, suppose there was a man born blind who could not see
dark and light forms, who could not see blue, yellow, red, or pink
forms, who could not see what was even and uneven, who could not see
the stars or the sun and moon. He might hear a man with good eyesight
saying: 'Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless,
and clean!' and he would go in search of a white cloth. Then a man
would cheat him with a dirty soiled garment thus: 'Good man, here
is a white cloth for you, beautiful, spotless, and clean.' And he
would accept it and put it on, and being satisfied with it, he would
utter words of satisfaction thus: 'Good indeed, sirs, is a white
cloth, beautiful, spotless, and clean!' What do you think,
Magandiya? When that man born blind accepted that dirty soiled
garment, put it on, and being satisfied with it, uttered words of
satisfaction thus: 'Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful,
spotless, and clean!' - did he do so knowing and seeing, or out of
faith in the man with good eyesight?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, he would have done so unknowing and unseeing, [510] out of faith
in the man with good eyesight."</P>
<P  >21.
"So too, Magandiya, the wanderers of other sects are blind and
visionless. They do not know health, they do not see Nibbana, yet
they utter this stanza thus:</P>
<P >
'The greatest of all gains is health,</P>
<P >
Nibbana is the greatest bliss.'</P>
<P  >This
stanza was uttered by the earlier Accomplished Ones, Fully
Enlightened Ones, thus:</P>
<P >
'The greatest of all gains is health,</P>
<P >
Nibbana is the greatest bliss,</P>
<P >
The eightfold path is the best of paths</P>
<P >
For it leads safely to the Deathless.'</P>
<P  >Now
it has gradually become current among ordinary people.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote745anc" HREF="#sdendnote745sym"><SUP>dccxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
And although this body, Magandiya, is a disease, a tumour, a dart, a
calamity, and an affliction, referring to this body you say: 'This
is that health, Master Gotama, this is that Nibbana.' You do not
have that noble vision, Magandiya, by means of which you might know
health and see Nibbana."</P>
<P  >22.
"I have confidence in Master Gotama thus: 'Master Gotama is
capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can come to
know health and to see Nibbana.'"</P>
<P  >"Magandiya,
suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light
forms … or the sun and moon. Then his friends and companions, his
kinsmen and relatives, would bring a physician to treat him. The
physician would make a medicine for him, yet by means of that
medicine the man's vision would not arise or be purified. What do
you think, Magandiya, would that doctor reap weariness and
disappointment?" - "Yes, Master Gotama." - "So too,
Magandiya, if I were to teach you the Dhamma thus: 'This is that
health, this is that Nibbana,' you might not know health or see
Nibbana, and that would be wearisome and troublesome for me." [511]</P>
<P  >23.
"I have confidence in Master Gotama thus: 'Master Gotama is
capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can come to
know health and to see Nibbana.'"</P>
<P  >"Magandiya,
suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light
forms … or the sun and moon. He might hear a man with good eyesight
saying: 'Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless,
and clean!' and he would go in search of a white cloth. Then a man
would cheat him with a dirty soiled garment thus: 'Good man, here
is a white cloth for you, beautiful, spotless, and clean.' And he
would accept it and put it on. Then his friends and companions, his
kinsmen and relatives, would bring a physician to treat him. The
physician would make medicine - emetics and purgatives, ointments and
counter-ointments and nasal treatment - and by means of that medicine
the man's vision would arise and be purified. Together with the
arising of his vision, his desire and liking for that dirty soiled
garment would be abandoned; then he might burn with indignation and
enmity towards that man and might think that he ought to be killed
thus: 'Indeed, I have long been tricked, cheated, and defrauded by
this man with this dirty soiled garment when he told me: "Good man,
here is a white cloth for you, beautiful, spotless, and clean.'"</P>
<P  >24.
"So too, Magandiya, if I were to teach you the Dhamma thus: 'This
is that health, this is that Nibbana,' you might know health and
see Nibbana. Together with the arising of your vision, your desire
and lust for the five aggregates affected by clinging might be
abandoned. Then perhaps you might think: 'Indeed, I have long been
tricked, cheated, and defrauded by this mind. For when clinging, I
have been clinging just to material form, I have been clinging just
to feeling, I have been clinging just to perception, I have been
clinging just to formations, I have been clinging just to
consciousness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote746anc" HREF="#sdendnote746sym"><SUP>dccxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
With my clinging as condition, being [comes to be]; with being as
condition, birth; with birth as condition, ageing and death, sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, [512] and despair come to be. Such is the
origin of this whole mass of suffering.'"</P>
<P  >25.
"1 have confidence in Master Gotama thus: 'Master Gotama is
capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I might rise up
from this seat cured of my blindness.'"</P>
<P  >"Then,
Magandiya, associate with true men. When you associate with true men,
you will hear the true Dhamma. When you hear the true Dhamma, you
will practise in accordance with the true Dhamma. When you practise
in accordance with the true Dhamma, you will know and see for
yourself thus: 'These are diseases, tumours, and darts; but here
these diseases, tumours, and darts cease without remainder.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote747anc" HREF="#sdendnote747sym"><SUP>dccxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
With the cessation of my clinging comes cessation of being; with the
cessation of being, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth,
ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair
cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.'"</P>
<P  >26.
When this was said, the wanderer Magandiya said: "Magnificent,
Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the
Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had
been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one
who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with
eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the
Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would receive the going forth
under Master Gotama. I would receive the full admission."</P>
<P  >27.
"Magandiya, one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires
the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline
lives on probation for four months. At the end of four months, if the
bhikkhus are satisfied with him, they give him the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus' state. But I recognise
individual differences in this matter."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the
going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live
on probation for four months, and if at the end of the four months
the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus' state, then I will live on
probation for four years. At the end of the four years if the
bhikkhus are satisfied with me, let them give me the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus' state." [513]</P>
<P  >28.
Then the wanderer Magandiya received the going forth under the
Blessed One, and he received the full admission. And soon, not long
after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent,
ardent, and resolute, the venerable Magandiya, by realising for
himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided
in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen
rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. He directly
knew: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had
to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of
being." And the venerable Magandiya became one of the arahants.</P>
