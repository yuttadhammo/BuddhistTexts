22. Alagaddupama Sutta - The Simile of the Snake (SETTING)</H2>
<P  >[130]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote248anc" HREF="#sdendnote248sym"><SUP>ccxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One</P>
<P  >was
living at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named
Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, thus: "As I understand
the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things called
obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who
engages in them."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote249anc" HREF="#sdendnote249sym"><SUP>ccxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Several bhikkhus, having heard about this, went to the bhikkhu
Arittha and asked him: "Friend Arittha, is it true that such a
pernicious view has arisen in you?"</P>
<P  >"Exactly
so, friends. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One,
those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to
obstruct one who engages in them."</P>
<P  >Then
these bhikkhus, desiring to detach him from that pernicious view,
pressed and questioned and cross-questioned him thus: "Friend
Arittha, do not say so. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is
not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not
speak thus. For in many discourses the Blessed One has stated how
obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to
obstruct one who engages in them. The Blessed One has stated how
sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering, and
much despair, and how great is the danger in them. With the simile of
the skeleton … with the simile of the piece of meat … with the
simile of the grass torch … with the simile of the pit of coals …
with the simile of the dream … with the simile of the borrowed
goods … with the simile of the tree laden with fruit … with the
simile of the slaughterhouse … with the simile of the sword stake …
with the simile of the snake's head, the Blessed One has stated how
sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering, and
much despair, and how great is the danger in them."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote250anc" HREF="#sdendnote250sym"><SUP>ccl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Yet
although pressed and questioned and cross-questioned by them in this
way, the bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, still
obstinately adhered to that pernicious view and continued to insist
upon it.</P>
<P  >4.
Since the bhikkhus were unable to detach him [131] from that
pernicious view, they went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him all that had
occurred, adding: "Venerable sir, since we could not detach the
bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, from this
pernicious view, we have reported this matter to the Blessed One."</P>
<P  >5.
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: "Come,
bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers,
in my name that the Teacher calls him." - [132] "Yes, venerable
sir," he replied, and he went to the bhikkhu Arittha and told him:
"The Teacher calls you, friend Arittha."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
friend," he replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One then
asked him: "Arittha, is it true that the following pernicious view
has arisen in you: 'As I understand the Dhamma taught by the
Blessed One, those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are
not able to obstruct one who engages in them'?'</P>
<P  >"Exactly
so, venerable sir. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed
One, those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able
to obstruct one who engages in them."</P>
<P  >6.
"Misguided man, to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma
in that way? Misguided man, in many discourses have I not stated how
obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to
obstruct one who engages in them? I have stated how sensual pleasures
provide little gratification, much suffering, and much despair, and
how great is the danger in them. With the simile of the skeleton …
with the simile of the piece of meat … with the simile of the grass
torch … with the simile of the pit of coals … with the simile of
the dream … with the simile of the borrowed goods … with the
simile of the tree laden with fruit … with the simile of the
slaughterhouse … with the simile of the sword stake … with the
simile of the snake's head, I have stated how sensual pleasures
provide little gratification, much suffering, and much despair, and
how great is the danger in them. But you, misguided man, have
misrepresented us by your wrong grasp and injured yourself and stored
up much demerit; for this will lead to your harm and suffering for a
long time."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote251anc" HREF="#sdendnote251sym"><SUP>ccli</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, what
do you think? Has this bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture
killers, kindled even a spark of wisdom in this Dhamma and
Discipline?"</P>
<P  >"How
could he, venerable sir? No, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers,
sat silent, dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum,
and without response. Then, knowing this, the Blessed One told him:
"Misguided man, you will be recognised by your own pernicious view.
I shall question the bhikkhus on this matter."</P>
<P  >8.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, [133]
do you understand the Dhamma taught by me as this bhikkhu Arittha,
formerly of the vulture killers, does when he misrepresents us by his
wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir. For in many discourses the Blessed One has stated how
obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to
obstruct one who engages in them. The Blessed One has stated how
sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering, and
much despair, and how great is the danger in them. With the simile of
the skeleton … with the simile of the snake's head, the Blessed
One has stated … how great is the danger in them."</P>
<P  >"Good,
bhikkhus. It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me
thus. For in many discourses I have stated how obstructive things are
obstructions, and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in
them. I have stated how sensual pleasures provide little
gratification, much suffering, and much despair, and how great is the
danger in them. With the simile of the skeleton … with the simile
of the snake's head, I have stated … how great is the danger in
them. But this bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers,
misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up
much demerit; for this will lead to this misguided man's harm and
suffering for a long time.</P>
<P  >9.
"Bhikkhus, that one can engage in sensual pleasures without sensual
desires, without perceptions of sensual desire, without thoughts of
sensual desire - that is impossible.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote252anc" HREF="#sdendnote252sym"><SUP>cclii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(THE SIMILE OF THE SNAKE)</H3>
<P  >10.
"Here, bhikkhus, some misguided men learn the Dhamma - discourses,
stanzas, expositions, verses, exclamations, sayings, birth stories,
marvels, and answers to questions - but having learned the Dhamma,
they do not examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Not
examining the meaning of those teachings with wisdom, they do not
gain a reflective acceptance of them. Instead they learn the Dhamma
only for the sake of criticising others and for winning in debates,
and they do not experience the good for the sake of which they
learned the Dhamma. Those teachings, being wrongly grasped by them,
conduce to their harm and suffering for a long time.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote253anc" HREF="#sdendnote253sym"><SUP>ccliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Suppose
a man needing a snake, seeking a snake, wandering in search of a
snake, saw a large snake and grasped its coils or its tail. It would
turn back on him and bite his hand or his arm or one of his limbs,
[134] and because of that he would come to death or deadly suffering.
Why is that? Because of his wrong grasp of the snake. So too, here
some misguided men learn the Dhamma … Those teachings, being
wrongly grasped by them, conduce to their harm and suffering for a
long time.</P>
<P  >11.
"Here, bhikkhus, some clansmen learn the Dhamma - discourses …
answers to questions - and having learned the Dhamma, they examine
the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Examining the meaning of
those teachings with wisdom, they gain a reflective acceptance of
them. They do not learn the Dhamma for the sake of criticising others
and for winning in debates, and they experience the good for the sake
of which they learned the Dhamma. Those teachings, being rightly
grasped by them, conduce to their welfare and happiness for a long
time.</P>
<P  >"Suppose
a man needing a snake, seeking a snake, wandering in search of a
snake, saw a large snake and caught it rightly with a cleft stick,
and having done so, grasped it rightly by the neck. Then although the
snake might wrap its coils round his hand or his arm or his limbs,
still he would not come to death or deadly suffering because of that.
Why is that? Because of his right grasp of the snake. So too, here
some clansmen learn the Dhamma … Those teachings, being rightly
grasped by them, conduce to their welfare and happiness for a long
time.</P>
<P  >12.
"Therefore, bhikkhus, when you understand the meaning of my
statements, remember it accordingly; and when you do not understand
the meaning of my statements, then ask either me about it or those
bhikkhus who are wise.</P>
<H3 >(THE SIMILE OF THE RAFT)</H3>
<P  >13.
"Bhikkhus, I shall show you how the Dhamma is similar to a raft,
being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of
grasping.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote254anc" HREF="#sdendnote254sym"><SUP>ccliv</SUP></A></SUP>
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." - "Yes, venerable
sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhus,
suppose a man in the course of a journey saw a great expanse of
water, whose near shore was dangerous and fearful and whose further
shore was safe and free from fear, but there was no ferryboat or
bridge going to the far shore. [135] Then he thought: 'There is
this great expanse of water, whose near shore is dangerous and
fearful and whose further shore is safe and free from fear, but there
is no ferryboat or bridge going to the far shore. Suppose I collect
grass, twigs, branches, and leaves and bind them together into a
raft, and supported by the raft and making an effort with my hands
and feet, I got safely across to the far shore.' And then the man
collected grass, twigs, branches, and leaves and bound them together
into a raft, and supported by the raft and making an effort with his
hands and feet, he got safely across to the far shore. Then, when he
had got across and had arrived at the far shore, he might think thus:
'This raft has been very helpful to me, since supported by it and
making an effort with my hands and feet, I got safely across to the
far shore. Suppose I were to hoist it on my head or load it on my
shoulder, and then go wherever I want.' Now, bhikkhus, what do you
think? By doing so, would that man be doing what should be done with
that raft?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"By
doing what would that man be doing what should be done with that
raft? Here, bhikkhus, when that man got across and had arrived at the
far shore, he might think thus: 'This raft has been very helpful to
me, since supported by it and making an effort with my hands and
feet, I got safely across to the far shore. Suppose I were to haul it
onto the dry land or set it adrift in the water, and then go wherever
I want.' Now, bhikkhus, it is by so doing that that man would be
doing what should be done with that raft. So I have shown you how the
Dhamma is similar to a raft, being for the purpose of crossing over,
not for the purpose of grasping.</P>
<P  >14.
"Bhikkhus, when you know the Dhamma to be similar to a raft, you
should abandon even good states, how much more so bad states.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote255anc" HREF="#sdendnote255sym"><SUP>cclv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(STANDPOINTS FOR VIEWS)</H3>
<P  >15.
"Bhikkhus, there are these six standpoints for views.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote256anc" HREF="#sdendnote256sym"><SUP>cclvi</SUP></A></SUP>
What are the six? Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person, who
has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in
their Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and
undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards material form thus: 'This is
mine, this I am, this is my self.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote257anc" HREF="#sdendnote257sym"><SUP>cclvii</SUP></A></SUP>
He regards feeling thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my
self.' He regards perception thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this
is my self.' He regards formations thus: 'This is mine, this I
am, this is my self.' He regards what is seen, heard, sensed,
cognized, encountered, sought, mentally pondered thus: 'This is
mine, this I am, this is my self.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote258anc" HREF="#sdendnote258sym"><SUP>cclviii</SUP></A></SUP>
And this standpoint for views, namely, 'This is self, this the
world; after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not
subject to change; [136] I shall endure as long as eternity' - this
too he regards thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote259anc" HREF="#sdendnote259sym"><SUP>cclix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >16.
"Bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple who has regard for noble
ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard
for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, regards
material form thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not
my self.' He regards feeling thus: 'This is not mine, this I am
not, this is not my self.' He regards perception thus: 'This is
not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' He regards
formations thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my
self.' He regards what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized,
encountered, sought, mentally pondered thus: 'This is not mine,
this I am not, this is not my self.' And this standpoint for views,
namely, 'This is self, this the world; after death I shall be
permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall
endure as long as eternity' - this too he regards thus: 'This is
not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'</P>
<P  >17.
"Since he regards them thus, he is not agitated about what is
non-existent."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote260anc" HREF="#sdendnote260sym"><SUP>cclx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(AGITATION)</H3>
<P  >18.
When this was said, a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One:
"Venerable sir, can there be agitation about what is nonexistent
externally?"</P>
<P  >"There
can be, bhikkhu, the Blessed One said." Here, bhikkhu, someone
thinks thus: 'Alas, I had it! Alas, I have it no longer! Alas, may
I have it! Alas, I do not get it!' Then he sorrows, grieves, and
laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught. That is
how there is agitation about what is non-existent externally."</P>
<P  >19.
"Venerable sir, can there be no agitation about what is
non-existent externally?"</P>
<P  >"There
can be, bhikkhu, the Blessed One said. "Here, bhikkhu, someone does
not think thus: 'Alas I had it! Alas, I have it no longer! Alas,
may I have it! Alas, I do not get it!' Then he does not sorrow,
grieve, and lament, he does not weep beating his breast and become
distraught. That is how there is no agitation about what is
non-existent externally."</P>
<P  >20.
"Venerable sir, can there be agitation about what is nonexistent
internally?"</P>
<P  >"There
can be, bhikkhu," the Blessed One said. "Here, bhikkhu, someone
has the view: 'This is self, this the world; after death I shall be
permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall
endure as long as eternity.' He hears the Tathagata or a disciple
of the Tathagata teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all
standpoints, decisions, obsessions, adherences, and underlying
tendencies, for the stilling of all formations, for the relinquishing
of all attachments, for the destruction of craving, for dispassion,
for cessation, for Nibbana. He [137] thinks thus: 'So I shall be
annihilated! So I shall perish! So I shall be no more!' Then he
sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and
becomes distraught. That is how there is agitation about what is
non-existent internally."</P>
<P  >21.
"Venerable sir, can there be no agitation about what is
non-existent internally?"</P>
<P  >"There
can be, bhikkhu," the Blessed One said. "Here, bhikkhu, someone
does not have the view: 'This is self … I shall endure as long as
eternity.' He hears the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata
teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all standpoints,
decisions, obsessions, adherences, and underlying tendencies, for the
stilling of all formations, for the relinquishing of all attachments,
for the destruction of craving, for dispassion, for cessation, for
Nibbana. He does not think thus: 'So I shall be annihilated! So I
shall perish! So I shall be no more!' Then he does not sorrow,

"Bhikkhus, you may well acquire that possession that is permanent,
everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and that might endure as
long as eternity.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote261anc" HREF="#sdendnote261sym"><SUP>cclxi</SUP></A></SUP>
But do you see any such possession, bhikkhus?" - "No, venerable
sir." - "Good, bhikkhus. I too do not see any possession that is
permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and that
might endure as long as eternity.</P>
<P  >23.
"Bhikkhus, you may well cling to that doctrine of self that would
not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who
clings to it.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote262anc" HREF="#sdendnote262sym"><SUP>cclxii</SUP></A></SUP>
But do you see any such doctrine of self, bhikkhus?" - "No,
venerable sir." - "Good, bhikkhus. I too do not see any doctrine
of self that would not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair in one who clings to it.</P>
<P  >24.
"Bhikkhus, you may well take as a support that view that would not
arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who takes
it as a support.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote263anc" HREF="#sdendnote263sym"><SUP>cclxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
But do you see any such support of views, bhikkhus?" - "No,
venerable sir." - "Good, bhikkhus. I too do not see any support
of views [138] that would not arouse sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair in one who takes it as a support.</P>
<P  >25.
"Bhikkhus, there being a self, would there be what belongs to my
self?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote264anc" HREF="#sdendnote264sym"><SUP>cclxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
- "Yes, venerable sir." - "Or, there being what belongs to a
self, would there be my self?" - "Yes, venerable sir." -
"Bhikkhus, since a self and what belongs to a self are not
apprehended as true and established, then this standpoint for views,
namely, 'This is self, this the world; after death I shall be
permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall
endure as long as eternity' - would it not be an utterly and
completely foolish teaching?"</P>
<P  >"What
else could it be, venerable sir? It would be an utterly and
completely foolish teaching."</P>
<P  >26.
"Bhikkhus, what do you think? Is material form permanent or
impermanent?" - "Impermanent, venerable sir." - "Is what is
impermanent suffering or happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable
sir." - "Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to
change, fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is
my self'?" - "No, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhus,
what do you think? Is feeling … Is perception … Are formations …
Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?" - "Impermanent,
venerable sir." - "Is what is impermanent suffering or
happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable sir." - "Is what is
impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, fit to be regarded
thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?" - "No,
venerable sir."</P>
<P  >27.
"Therefore, bhikkhus, any kind of material form whatever, whether
past, future, or present, internal or external, [139] gross or
subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all material form should
be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not
mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Any kind of feeling
whatever … Any kind of perception whatever … Any kind of
formations whatever … Any kind of consciousness whatever, whether
past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle,

as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this
I am not, this is not my self.'</P>
<P  >28.
"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes
disenchanted with material form, disenchanted with feeling,
disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with formations,
disenchanted with consciousness.</P>
<P  >29.
"Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion
[his mind] is liberated.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote265anc" HREF="#sdendnote265sym"><SUP>cclxv</SUP></A></SUP>
When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'It is liberated.'

not yours … Formations are not yours … Consciousness is not
yours. Abandon it. When you have abandoned it, that will lead to your
welfare and happiness for a long time.</P>
