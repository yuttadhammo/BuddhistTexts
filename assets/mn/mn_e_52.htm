52. Atthakanagara Sutta - The Man from Atthakanagara</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Venerable Ananda was living at
Beluvagamaka near Vesali.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara had
arrived at Pataliputta for some business or other. Then he went to a
certain bhikkhu in Kukkuta's Park, and after paying homage to him,
he sat down at one side and asked him: "Where does the venerable
Ananda live now, venerable sir? I wish to see the venerable Ananda."</P>
<P  >"The
venerable Ananda is living at Beluvagamaka near Vesali, householder."</P>
<P  >3.
When the householder Dasama had completed his business at
Pataliputta, he went to the venerable Ananda at Beluvagamaka near
Vesali. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and asked
him:</P>
<P  >"Venerable
Ananda, has any one thing been proclaimed by the Blessed One who
knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind
comes to be liberated, his undestroyed taints come to be destroyed,
and he attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not
attained before?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote550anc" HREF="#sdendnote550sym"><SUP>dl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Yes,
householder, one such thing has been proclaimed by the Blessed One."
[350]</P>
<P  >"What
is that one thing, venerable Ananda?"</P>
<P  >4.
"Here, householder, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He considers this and
understands it thus: 'This first jhana is conditioned and
volitionally produced.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote551anc" HREF="#sdendnote551sym"><SUP>dli</SUP></A></SUP>
But whatever is conditioned and volitionally produced is impermanent,
subject to cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains the
destruction of the taints.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote552anc" HREF="#sdendnote552sym"><SUP>dlii</SUP></A></SUP>
But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints, then because
of that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote553anc" HREF="#sdendnote553sym"><SUP>dliii</SUP></A></SUP>
with the destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one due to
reappear spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain final
Nibbana without ever returning from that world.</P>
<P  >"This
is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened, wherein if a bhikkhu abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind comes to be
liberated, his undestroyed taints come to be destroyed, and he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not attained
before.</P>
<P  >5.
"Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters and abides in the second jhana … He considers this
and understands it thus: 'This second jhana is conditioned and
volitionally produced. But whatever is conditioned and volitionally
produced is impermanent, subject to cessation.' Standing upon that,
he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain
the destruction of the taints … without ever returning from that
world.</P>
<P  >"This
too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One [351] … wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute … he attains the
supreme security from bondage that he had not attained before.</P>
<P  >6.
"Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu …
enters upon and abides in the third jhana … He considers this and
understands it thus: 'This third jhana is conditioned and
volitionally produced. But whatever is conditioned and volitionally
produced is impermanent, subject to cessation.' Standing upon that,
he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain
the destruction of the taints … without ever returning from that
world.</P>
<P  >"This
too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One … wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute … he attains the
supreme security from bondage that he had not attained before.</P>
<P  >7.
"Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain … a bhikkhu
enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana … He considers this and
understands it thus: 'This fourth jhana is conditioned and
volitionally produced. But whatever is conditioned and volitionally
produced is impermanent, subject to cessation.' Standing upon that,
he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain
the destruction of the taints … without ever returning from that
world.</P>
<P  >"This
too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One … wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute … he attains the
supreme security from bondage that he had not attained before.</P>
<P  >8.
"Again, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third,
likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to
all as to himself, he abides pervading the allencompassing world with
a mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable,
without hostility and without ill will. He considers this and
understands it thus: 'This deliverance of mind through
loving-kindness is conditioned and volitionally produced. But
whatever is conditioned and volitionally produced is impermanent,
subject to cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains the
destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction
of the taints … without ever returning from that world.</P>
<P  >"This
too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One … wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute … he attains the
supreme security from bondage that he had not attained before.</P>
<P  >9.
"Again, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with compassion … without ill will. He considers this and
understands it thus: 'This deliverance of mind through compassion
is conditioned and volitionally produced. But whatever is conditioned
and volitionally produced is impermanent, subject to cessation.'
Standing upon that, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if
he does not attain the destruction of the taints … without ever
returning from that world.</P>
<P  >"This
too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One … wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute … he attains the
supreme security from bondage that he had not attained before.</P>
<P  >10.
"Again, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with appreciative joy … without ill will. He considers this and
understands it thus: 'This deliverance of mind through appreciative
joy is conditioned and volitionally produced. But whatever is
conditioned and volitionally produced is impermanent, subject to
cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains the destruction of the
taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints …
without ever returning from that world.</P>
<P  >"This
too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One … wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute … he attains the
supreme security from bondage that he had not attained before.</P>
<P  >11.
"Again, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with equanimity … without ill will. He considers this and
understands it thus: 'This deliverance of mind through equanimity
is conditioned and volitionally produced. But whatever is conditioned
and volitionally produced is impermanent, [352] subject to
cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains the destruction of the
taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints …
without ever returning from that world.</P>
<P  >"This
too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One … wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute … he attains the
supreme security from bondage that he had not attained before."</P>
<P  >12.
"Again, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with
the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is
infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite
space. He considers this and understands it thus: 'This attainment
of the base of infinite space is conditioned and volitionally
produced. But whatever is conditioned and volitionally produced is
impermanent, subject to cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains
the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the
destruction of the taints … without ever returning from that world.</P>
<P  >"This
too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One … wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute … he attains the
supreme security from bondage that he had not attained before.</P>
<P  >13.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware
that 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the base of infinite consciousness. He considers this and
understands it thus: 'This attainment of the base of infinite
consciousness is conditioned and volitionally produced. But whatever
is conditioned and volitionally produced is impermanent, subject to
cessation.' Standing upon that, he attains the destruction of the
taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints …
without ever returning from that world.</P>
<P  >"This
too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One … wherein if a
bhikkhu abides diligent, ardent, and resolute … he attains the
supreme security from bondage that he had not attained before.</P>
<P  >14.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the base of nothingness. He considers this and
understands it thus: 'This attainment of the base of nothingness is
conditioned and volitionally produced. But whatever is conditioned
and volitionally produced is impermanent, subject to cessation.'
Standing upon that, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if
he does not attain the destruction of the taints, then because of
that desire for the Dhamma, that delight in the Dhamma, with the
destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes one due to reappear
spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain final Nibbana
without ever returning from that world.</P>
<P  >"This
too is one thing proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened, wherein if a bhikkhu abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind comes to be
liberated, his undestroyed taints come to be destroyed, and he
attains the supreme security from bondage that he had not attained
before."<SUP> <A  NAME="sdendnote554anc" HREF="#sdendnote554sym"><SUP>dliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
When venerable Ananda had spoken, the householder Dasama of
Atthakanagara said to him: "Venerable Ananda, just as if a man
seeking one entrance to a hidden treasure came all at once upon
eleven [353] entrances to a hidden treasure, so too, while I was
seeking one door to the Deathless, I have come all at once to hear of
eleven doors to the Deathless.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote555anc" HREF="#sdendnote555sym"><SUP>dlv</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as if a man had a house with eleven doors and when that house
caught on fire, he could flee to safety by any one of these eleven
doors, so I can flee to safety by any one of these eleven doors to
the Deathless. Venerable sir, these sectarians will even seek a
teacher's fee for their teachers; why shouldn't I make an
offering to the venerable Ananda?"</P>
<P  >16.
Then the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara assembled the Sangha of
bhikkhus from Pataliputta and Vesalt, and with his own hands he
served and satisfied them with various kinds of good food. He
presented a pair of cloths to each bhikkhu, and he presented a triple
robe to the venerable Ananda, and he had a dwelling worth five
hundred<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote556anc" HREF="#sdendnote556sym"><SUP>dlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
built for the venerable Ananda.</P>
