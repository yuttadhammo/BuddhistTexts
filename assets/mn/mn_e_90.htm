90. Kannakatthala Sutta - At Kannakatthala</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Ujunna, in the Kannakatthala Deer Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujunna
for some business or other. Then he told a man: "Come, good man, go
to the Blessed One and pay homage in my name with your head at his
feet, and ask whether he is free from illness and affliction, and is
healthy, strong, and abiding in comfort, saying: 'Venerable sir,
King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage with his head at the Blessed
One's feet, and he asks whether the Blessed One is free from
illness … and abiding in comfort.' And say this: 'Venerable
sir, today King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see the Blessed One
after he has had his breakfast.'"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sire," the man replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and delivered his
message.</P>
<P  >3.
The sisters Soma and Sakula<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote845anc" HREF="#sdendnote845sym"><SUP>dcccxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
heard: "Today [126] King Pasenadi of Kosala will go to see the
Blessed One after he has had his breakfast."</P>
<P  >Then,
while the meal was being served, the two sisters went to the king and
said: "Sire, pay homage in our name with your head at the Blessed
One's feet, and ask whether he is free from illness … and abiding
in comfort, saying: 'Venerable sir, the sisters Soma and Sakula pay
homage with their heads at the Blessed One's feet, and they ask
whether he is free from illness.. .and abiding in comfort.'"</P>
<P  >4.
Then, when he had finished his breakfast, King Pasenadi of Kosala
went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down
at one side and delivered the message of the sisters Soma and Sakula.</P>
<P  >"But,
great king, could the sisters Soma and Sakula find no other
messenger?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, the sisters Soma and Sakula heard: 'Today King Pasenadi of
Kosala will go to see the Blessed One after he has had his
breakfast.' Then, while the meal was being served, the sisters Soma
and Sakula came to me and said: 'Sire, pay homage in our names with
your head at the Blessed One's feet, and ask whether he is free
from illness … and abiding in comfort.'"</P>
<P  >"May
the sisters Soma and Sakula be happy, great king."</P>
<P  >5.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Venerable
sir, I have heard this: 'The recluse Gotama says: "There is no
recluse or brahmin who is omniscient and all-seeing, who can claim to
have complete knowledge and vision; that is not possible.'"Venerable
sir, do those who speak thus [127] say what has been said by the
Blessed One, and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact?
Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that
nothing that provides a ground for censure can be legitimately
deduced from their assertions?"</P>
<P  >"Great
King, those who speak thus do not say what has been said by me, but
misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact."</P>
<P  >6.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed General Vidudabha: "General,
who introduced this story into the palace?"</P>
<P  >"It
was Sanjaya, sire, the brahmin of the Akasa clan."</P>
<P  >7.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala told a man: "Come, good man, in my
name tell Sanjaya, the brahmin of the Akasa clan: 'Venerable sir,
King Pasenadi of Kosala calls you.'"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sire," the man replied. He went to Sanjaya, the brahmin of the
Akasa clan, and told him: "Venerable sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala
calls you."</P>
<P  >8.
Meanwhile King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Venerable
sir, could something else have been said by the Blessed One referring
to that, and the person understood it wrongly? In what way does the
Blessed One recall making that utterance?"</P>
<P  >"I
recall having actually made the utterance in this way, great king:
'There is no recluse or brahmin who knows all, who sees all,
simultaneously; that is not possible.'"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote846anc" HREF="#sdendnote846sym"><SUP>dcccxlvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"What
the Blessed One has said appears reasonable, what the Blessed One has
said appears to be supported by reason: 'There</P>
<P  >is
no recluse or brahmin [128] who knows all, who sees all,
simultaneously; that is not possible.'"</P>
<P  >9.
"There are these four castes, venerable sir: the nobles, the
brahmins, the merchants, and the workers. Is there any distinction or
difference among them?"</P>
<P  >"There
are these four castes, great king: the nobles, the brahmins, the
merchants, and the workers. Two of them, that is, the nobles and the
brahmins, are held to be superior since men pay homage to them, rise
up for them, and accord them reverential salutation and polite
services."</P>
<P  >10.
"Venerable sir, I was not asking about this present life; I was
asking about the life to come.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote847anc" HREF="#sdendnote847sym"><SUP>dcccxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
There are these four castes, venerable sir: the nobles, the brahmins,
the merchants, and the workers. Is there any distinction or
difference among them?"</P>
<P  >"Great
king, there are these five factors of striving.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote848anc" HREF="#sdendnote848sym"><SUP>dcccxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
What five? Here a bhikkhu has faith, he places his faith in the
Tathagata's enlightenment thus: 'The Blessed One is accomplished,
fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime,
knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher
of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.' Then he is free from
illness and affliction, possessing a good digestion that is neither
too cool nor too warm but medium and able to bear the strain of
striving. Then he is honest and sincere, and shows himself as he
actually is to his teacher and his companions in the holy life. Then
he is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking
wholesome states, steadfast, launching his effort with firmness and
persevering in cultivating wholesome states. Then he is wise; he
possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that is noble and
penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. These
are the five factors of striving.</P>
<P  >"There
are these four castes, great king: the nobles, the brahmins, the
merchants, and the workers. Now if they possessed these five factors
of striving, it would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long
time."</P>
<P  >11.
"Venerable sir, there are these four castes: the nobles, the
brahmins, the merchants, [129] and the workers. Now if they possessed
these five factors of striving, would there be any difference among
them here in that respect?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
great king, I say that the difference among them would lie in the
diversity of their striving. Suppose there were two tamable elephants
or tamable horses or tamable oxen that were well tamed and well
disciplined, and two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable
oxen that were untamed and undisciplined. What do you think, great
king? Would the two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable
oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined, being tamed, acquire
the behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of the
tamed?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"And
would the two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable oxen
that were untamed and undisciplined, being untamed, acquire the
behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of the tamed,
like the two elephants or horses or oxen that were well tamed and
well disciplined?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"So
too, great king, it is not possible that what can be achieved by one
who has faith, who is free from illness, who is honest and sincere,
who is energetic, and who is wise, can be achieved by one who has no
faith, who has much illness, who is fraudulent and deceitful, who is
lazy, and who is not wise."</P>
<P  >12.
"What the Blessed One has said appears reasonable, what the Blessed
One has said appears to be supported by reason.</P>
<P  >"There
are these four castes, venerable sir: the nobles, the brahmins, the
merchants, and the workers. Now if they possessed these five factors
of striving, and if their striving was right, would there be any
difference among them in that respect?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
great king, in this respect I say that among them there is no
difference, that is, between the deliverance of one and the
deliverance of the others. Suppose a man took dry saka wood, lit a
fire, and produced heat; and then another man took dry sala wood, lit
a fire, and produced heat; [130] and then another man took dry mango
wood, lit a fire, and produced heat; and then another man took dry
fig wood, lit a fire, and produced heat. What do you think, great
king? Would there be any difference among these fires lit with
different kinds of wood, that is, between the flame of one and the
flames of the others, or between the colour of one and the colours of
the others, or between the radiance of one and the radiances of the
others?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"So
too, great king, when a fire is kindled by energy, lit by striving,
there is, I say, no difference, that is, between the deliverance of
one and the deliverance of the others."</P>
<P  >13.
"What the Blessed One has said appears reasonable, what the Blessed
One has said appears to be supported by reason. But, venerable sir,
how is it: are there gods?"</P>
<P  >"Why
do you ask that, great king?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, I was asking whether those gods come back to this [human] state
or whether they do not."</P>
<P  >"Great
king, those gods who are still subject to affliction come back to
this [human] state, those gods who are no longer subject to
affliction do not come back to this [human] state."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote849anc" HREF="#sdendnote849sym"><SUP>dcccxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
When this was said, General Vidudabha asked the Blessed One:
"Venerable sir, can those gods who are still subject to affliction
and who come back to this [human] state topple or banish from that
place those gods who are no longer subject to affliction and who do
not come back to this [human] state?"</P>
<P  >Then
the venerable Ananda thought: "This General Vidudabha is the son of
King Pasenadi of Kosala, and I am the son of the Blessed One. This is
the time for one son to talk with the other." He said to General
Vidudabha: "General, I shall ask you a question in return. Answer
it as you choose. General, what do you think? There is the whole
extent of King Pasenadi of Kosala's realm, where [131] he exercises
lordship and sovereignty; now can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple or
banish from that place any recluse or brahmin, irrespective of
whether that recluse or brahmin has merit or not and whether he leads
the</P>
<P  >holy
life or not?"</P>
<P  >"He
can do so, sir."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, general? There is the whole extent that is not King
Pasenadi of Kosala's realm, where he does not exercise lordship and
sovereignty; now can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple or banish from
that place any recluse or brahmin, irrespective of whether that
recluse or brahmin has merit or not and whether he leads the holy
life or not?"</P>
<P  >"He
cannot do so, sir."</P>
<P  >"General,
what do you think? Have you heard of the gods of the Thirty-three?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir, I have heard of them. And King Pasenadi of Kosala has heard of
them too."</P>
<P  >"General,
what do you think? Can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple the gods of the
Thirty-three or banish them from that place?"</P>
<P  >"Sir,
King Pasenadi of Kosala cannot even see the gods of the Thirty-three,
so how could he topple them or banish them from that place?"</P>
<P  >"So
too, general, those gods who are still subject to affliction and who
come back to this [human] state cannot even see those gods who are no
longer subject to affliction and who do not come back to this [human]
state; so how could they topple them or banish them from that place?"</P>
<P  >15.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala asked the Blessed One: "Venerable sir,
what is this bhikkhu's name?"</P>
<P  >"His
name is Ananda, great king."</P>
<P  >"Ananda
[joy] he is indeed, venerable sir, and Ananda he appears. What [132]
the venerable Ananda has said appears reasonable, what he has said
appears to be supported by reason. But, venerable sir, how is it: are
there Brahmas?"</P>
<P  >"Why
do you ask that, great king?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, I was asking whether those Brahmas come back to this [human]
state or whether they do not."</P>
<P  >"Great
king, any Brahma who is still subject to affliction comes back to
this [human] state, any Brahma who is no longer subject to affliction
does not come back to this [human] state."</P>
<P  >16.
Then a man announced to King Pasenadi of Kosala: "Great king,
Sanjaya, the brahmin of the Akasa clan, has come."</P>
<P  >King
Pasenadi of Kosala asked Sanjaya, the brahmin of the Akasa clan:
"Brahmin, who introduced this story to the palace?"</P>
<P  >"Sire,
it was General Vidudabha."</P>
<P  >General
Vidudabha said: "Sire, it was Sanjaya, the brahmin of the Akasa
clan."</P>
<P  >17.
Then a man announced to King Pasenadi of Kosala: "Sire, it is time
to depart."</P>
<P  >King
Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, we have
asked the Blessed One about omniscience, and the Blessed One has
answered about omniscience; we approve of and accept that answer, and
so we are satisfied. We have asked the Blessed One about purification
in the four castes, and the</P>
<P  >Blessed
One has answered about purification in the four castes; we approve of
and accept that answer, and so we are satisfied. We have asked the
Blessed One about the gods, and the Blessed One has answered about
the gods; we approve of and accept that answer, and so we are
satisfied. We have asked the Blessed One about the Brahmas, and the
Blessed One has answered about the Brahmas; we approve of and accept
that answer, and so we are satisfied. Whatever we asked the Blessed
One, that the Blessed One has answered; we approve of and accept
those answers, and so we are satisfied. [133] And now, venerable sir,
we depart. We are busy and have much to do."</P>
<P  >"Now
is the time, great king, to do as you think fit."</P>
<P  >18.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to
the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.</P>
