121. Culasunnata Sutta - The Shorter Discourse on Voidness</H2>
<P  >[104]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi. in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara's Mother.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Ananda rose from meditation,
went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down
at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >3.
"Venerable sir, on one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named Nagaraka. There,
venerable sir, I heard and learned this from the Blessed One's own
lips: 'Now, Ananda, I often abide in voidness.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1137anc" HREF="#sdendnote1137sym"><SUP>mcxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Did I hear that correctly, venerable sir, did I learn that correctly,
attend to that correctly, remember that correctly?"</P>
<P  >"Certainly,
Ananda, you heard that correctly, learned that correctly, attended to
that correctly, remembered that correctly. As formerly, Ananda, so
now too I often abide in voidness.</P>
<P  >4.
"Ananda, just as this Palace of Migara's Mother is void of
elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, void of gold and silver, void
of the assembly of men and women, and there is present only this
non-voidness, namely, the singleness dependent on the Sangha of
bhikkhus; so too, a bhikkhu - not attending to the perception of
village, not attending to the perception of people - attends to the
singleness dependent on the perception of forest.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1138anc" HREF="#sdendnote1138sym"><SUP>mcxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
His mind enters into that perception of forest and acquires
confidence, steadiness, and decision. He understands thus: 'Whatever
disturbances there might be dependent on the perception of village,
those are not present here; whatever disturbances there might be
dependent on the perception of people, those are not present here.
There is present only this amount of disturbance, namely, the
singleness dependent on the perception of forest.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1139anc" HREF="#sdendnote1139sym"><SUP>mcxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
He understands: 'This field of perception is void of the perception
of village; this field of perception is void of the perception of
people. There is present only this non-voidness, namely, the
singleness dependent on the perception of forest.' Thus he regards
it as void of what is not there, but as to what [105] remains there
he understands that which is present thus: 'This is present.'
Thus, Ananda, this is his genuine, undistorted, pure descent into
voidness.</P>
<P  >5.
"Again, Ananda, a bhikkhu - not attending to the perception of
people, not attending to the perception of forest - attends to the
singleness dependent on the perception of earth.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1140anc" HREF="#sdendnote1140sym"><SUP>mcxl</SUP></A></SUP>
His mind enters into that perception of earth and acquires
confidence, steadiness, and decision. Just as a bull's hide becomes
free from folds when fully stretched with a hundred pegs; so too, a
bhikkhu - not attending to any of the ridges and hollows of this
earth, to the rivers and ravines, the tracts of stumps and thorns,
the mountains and uneven places - attends to the singleness dependent
on the perception of earth. His mind enters into that perception of
earth and acquires confidence, steadiness, and decision. He
understands thus: 'Whatever disturbances there might be dependent
on the perception of people, those are not present here; whatever
disturbances there might be dependent on the perception of forest,
those are not present here. There is present only this amount of
disturbance, namely, the singleness dependent on the perception of
earth.' He understands: 'This field of perception is void of the
perception of. people; this field of perception is void of the
perception of forest. There is present only this non-voidness,
namely, the singleness dependent on the perception of earth.' Thus
he regards it as void of what is not there, but as to what remains
there he understands that which is present thus: 'This is present.'
Thus, Ananda, this too is his genuine, undistorted, pure descent into
voidness.</P>
<P  >6.
"Again, Ananda, a bhikkhu - not attending to the perception of
forest, not attending to the perception of earth - attends to the
singleness dependent on the perception of the base of infinite
space.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1141anc" HREF="#sdendnote1141sym"><SUP>mcxli</SUP></A></SUP>
His mind enters into that perception of the base of infinite space
and acquires confidence, steadiness, and decision. He understands
thus: 'Whatever disturbances there might be dependent on the
perception of forest, those are not present here; whatever
disturbances there might be [106] dependent on the perception of
earth, those are not present here. There is present only this amount
of disturbance, namely, the singleness dependent on the perception of
the base of infinite space.' He understands: 'This field of
perception is void of the perception of forest; this field of
perception is void of the perception of earth. There is present only
this non-voidness, namely, the singleness dependent on the perception
of the base of infinite space.' Thus he regards it as void of what
is not there, but as to what remains there he understands that which
is present thus: 'This is present.' Thus, Ananda, this too is his
genuine, undistorted, pure descent into voidness.</P>
<P  >7.
"Again, Ananda, a bhikkhu - not attending to the perception of
earth, not attending to the perception of the base of infinite space
- attends to the singleness dependent on the perception of the base
of infinite consciousness. His mind enters into that perception of
the base of infinite consciousness and acquires confidence,
steadiness, and decision. He understands thus: 'Whatever
disturbances there might be dependent on the perception of earth,
those are not present here; whatever disturbances there might be
dependent on the perception of the base of infinite space, those are
not present here. There is present only this amount of disturbance,
namely, the singleness dependent on the perception of the base of
infinite consciousness.' He understands: 'This field of
perception is void of the perception of earth; this field of
perception is void of the perception of the base of infinite space.
There is present only this non-voidness, namely, the singleness
dependent on the perception of the base of infinite consciousness.'
Thus he regards it as void of what is not there, but as to what
remains there he understands that which is present thus: 'This is
present.' Thus, Ananda, this too is his genuine, undistorted, pure
descent into voidness.</P>
<P  >8.
"Again, Ananda, a bhikkhu - not attending to the perception of the
base of infinite space, not attending to the perception of the base
of infinite consciousness - attends to the singleness dependent on
the perception of the base of nothingness. His mind enters into that
perception of the base of nothingness and acquires confidence,
steadiness, and decision. He understands thus: 'Whatever
disturbances there might be dependent on the perception of the base
of infinite space, those are not present here; whatever disturbances
there might be dependent on the perception of the base of infinite
consciousness, those are not present here. There is present only this
amount of disturbance, namely, the singleness dependent on the
perception of the base of nothingness.' He understands: 'This
field of perception is void of the perception of the base of infinite
space; [107] this field of perception is void of the perception of
the base of infinite consciousness. There is present only this
non-voidness, namely, the singleness dependent on the perception of
the base of nothingness.' Thus he regards it as void of what is not
there, but as to what remains there he understands that which is
present thus: 'This is present.' Thus, Ananda, this too is his
genuine, undistorted, pure descent into voidness.</P>
<P  >9.
"Again, Ananda, a bhikkhu - not attending to the perception of the
base of infinite consciousness, not attending to the perception of
the base of nothingness - attends to the singleness dependent on the
perception of the base of neither-perceptionnor-non-perception. His
mind enters into that perception of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception and acquires confidence,
steadiness, and decision. He understands thus: 'Whatever
disturbances there might be dependent on the perception of the base
of infinite consciousness, those are not present here; whatever
disturbances there might be dependent on the perception of the base
of nothingness, those are not present here. There is present only
this amount of disturbance, namely, the singleness dependent on the
perception of the base of neitherperception-nor-non-perception.' He
understands: 'This field of perception is void of the perception of
the base of infinite consciousness; this field of perception is void
of the perception of the base of nothingness. There is present only
this non-voidness, namely, the singleness dependent on the perception
of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.' Thus he
regards it as void of what is not there, but as to what remains there
he understands that which is present thus: 'This is present.'
Thus, Ananda, this too is his genuine, undistorted, pure descent into
voidness.</P>
<P  >10.
"Again, Ananda, a bhikkhu - not attending to the perception of the
base of nothingness, not attending to the perception of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception - attends to the singleness
dependent on the signless concentration of mind.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1142anc" HREF="#sdendnote1142sym"><SUP>mcxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
His mind enters into that signless concentration of mind and acquires
confidence, steadiness, and decision. He understand thus: 'Whatever
disturbances there might be dependent on the perception of the base
of nothingness, those are not present here; whatever disturbances
there might be dependent on the perception of the base of
neither-perceptionnor-non-perception, those are not present here.
There is present only this amount of disturbance, namely, that
connected with the six bases that are dependent on this body and
[108] conditioned by life.' He understands: 'This field of
perception is void of the perception of the base of nothingness; this
field of perception is void of the perception of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. There is present only this
non-voidness, namely, that connected with the six bases that are
dependent on this body and conditioned by life.' Thus he regards it
as void of what is not there, but as to what remains there he
understands that which is present thus: 'This is present.' Thus,
Ananda, this too is his genuine, undistorted, pure descent into
voidness.</P>
<P  >11.
"Again, Ananda, a bhikkhu - not attending to the perception of the
base of nothingness, not attending to the perception of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception - attends to the singleness
dependent on the signless concentration of mind. His mind enters into
that signless concentration of mind and acquires confidence,
steadiness, and decision. He understands thus: 'This signless
concentration of mind is conditioned and volitionally produced. But
whatever is conditioned and volitionally produced is impermanent,
subject to cessation.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1143anc" HREF="#sdendnote1143sym"><SUP>mcxliii</SUP></A></SUP>
When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of
sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'It is
liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.'</P>
<P  >12.
"He understands thus: 'Whatever disturbances there might be
dependent on the taint of sensual desire, those are not present here;
whatever disturbances there might be dependent on the taint of being,
those are not present here; whatever disturbances there might be
dependent on the taint of ignorance, those are not present here.
There is present only this amount of disturbance, namely, that
connected with the six bases that are dependent on this body and
conditioned by life.' He understands: 'This field of perception
is void of the taint of sensual desire; this field of perception is
void of the taint of being; this field of perception is void of the
taint of ignorance. There is present only this non-voidness, namely,
that connected with the six bases that are dependent on this body and
conditioned by life.' Thus he regards it as void of what is not
there, but as to what remains there he understands that which is
present thus: 'This is present.' Thus, Ananda, this is his
genuine, [109] undistorted, pure descent into voidness, supreme and
unsurpassed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1144anc" HREF="#sdendnote1144sym"><SUP>mcxliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
"Ananda, whatever recluses and brahmins in the past entered upon
and abided in pure, supreme, unsurpassed voidness, all entered upon
and abided in this same pure, supreme, unsurpassed voidness. Whatever
recluses and brahmins in the future will enter upon and abide in
pure, supreme, unsurpassed voidness, all will enter upon and abide in
this same pure, supreme, unsurpassed voidness. Whatever recluses and
brahmins in the present enter upon and abide in pure, supreme,
unsurpassed voidness, all enter upon and abide in this same pure,
supreme, unsurpassed voidness. Therefore, Ananda, you should train
thus: 'We will enter upon and abide in pure, supreme, unsurpassed
voidness.'"</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
