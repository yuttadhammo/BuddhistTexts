6. Akankheyya Sutta - If a Bhikkhu Should Wish</H2>
<P  >[33]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, dwell possessed of virtue, possessed of the Patimokkha,
restrained with the restraint of the Patimokkha, perfect in conduct
and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, train by
undertaking the training precepts.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote76anc" HREF="#sdendnote76sym"><SUP>lxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I be dear and agreeable to my
companions in the holy life, respected and esteemed by them,' let
him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not
neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty
huts.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote77anc" HREF="#sdendnote77sym"><SUP>lxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I be one to obtain robes,
almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites,' let him fulfil
the precepts …</P>
<P  >5.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May the services of those whose
robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites I use bring
them great fruit and benefit,' let him fulfil the precepts …</P>
<P  >6.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'When my kinsmen and relatives who
have passed away and died remember me with confidence in their minds,
may that bring them great fruit and great benefit,' let him fulfil
the precepts … <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote78anc" HREF="#sdendnote78sym"><SUP>lxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >7.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I become a conqueror of
discontent and delight, and may discontent and delight not conquer
me; may I abide transcending discontent and delight whenever they
arise,' let him fulfil the precepts …</P>
<P  >8.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I become a conqueror of fear and
dread, and may fear and dread not conquer me; may I abide
transcending fear and dread whenever they arise,' let him fulfil
the precepts …</P>
<P  >9.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I become one to obtain at will,
without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that constitute the
higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now,' let him
fulfil the precepts …</P>
<P  >10.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I contact with the body and abide
in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending
forms,' let him fulfil the precepts … [34]<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote79anc" HREF="#sdendnote79sym"><SUP>lxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I, with the destruction of three
fetters, become a stream-enterer, no longer subject to perdition,
bound [for deliverance], headed for enlightenment,' let him fulfil
the precepts … <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote80anc" HREF="#sdendnote80sym"><SUP>lxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I, with the destruction of three
fetters and with the attenuation of lust, hate, and delusion, become
a once-returner, returning once to this world to make an end of
suffering,' let him fulfil the precepts …</P>
<P  >13.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I, with the destruction of the
five lower fetters, become due to reappear spontaneously [in the Pure
Abodes] and there attain final Nibbana, without ever returning from
that world,' let him fulfil the precepts … <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote81anc" HREF="#sdendnote81sym"><SUP>lxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
"If a bhikkhu should wish:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote82anc" HREF="#sdendnote82sym"><SUP>lxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
'May I wield the various kinds of supernormal power: having been
one, may I become many; having been many, may I become one; may I
appear and vanish; may I go unhindered through a wall, through an
enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; may I dive in
and out of the earth as though it were water; may I walk on water
without sinking as though it were earth; seated crosslegged, may I
travel in space like a bird; with my hand may I touch and stroke the
moon and sun so powerful and mighty; may I wield bodily mastery, even
as far as the Brahma-world,' let him fulfil the precepts …</P>
<P  >15.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I, with the divine ear element,
which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds,
the divine and the human, those that are far as well as near,' let
him fulfil the precepts …</P>
<P  >16.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I understand the minds of other
beings, of other persons, having encompassed them with my own mind.
May I understand a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a
mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; may I understand a
mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by
hate as unaffected by hate; may I understand a mind affected by
delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as
unaffected by delusion; may I understand a contracted mind as
contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; may I understand an
exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; may I
understand a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as
unsurpassed; may I understand a concentrated mind as concentrated
[35] and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; may I understand a
liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated,'
let him fulfil the precepts …</P>
<P  >17.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I recollect my manifold past
lives, that is, one birth, two births … (as Sutta 4, §27) … Thus
with their aspects and their particulars may I recollect my manifold
past lives,' let him fulfil the precepts …</P>
<P  >18.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I, with the divine eye, which is
purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and
reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and
unfortunate; may I understand how beings pass on according to their
actions thus:' … (as Sutta 4, §29) … let him fulfil the
precepts …</P>
<P  >19.
"If a bhikkhu should wish: 'May I, by realising for myself with
direct knowledge, here and now enter upon and abide in the
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with
the destruction of the taints,'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote83anc" HREF="#sdendnote83sym"><SUP>lxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
[36] let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of
mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in
empty huts.</P>
<P  >20.
"So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'Bhikkhus,
dwell possessed of virtue, possessed of the Patimokkha, restrained
with the restraint of the Patimokkha, perfect in conduct and resort,
and seeing fear in the slightest fault, train by undertaking the
training precepts.'"</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
