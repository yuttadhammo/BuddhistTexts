38. Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta - The Greater Discourse on the
Destruction of Craving</H2>
<H3 >(SETTING)</H3>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named
Sati, son of a fisherman, thus: "As I understand the Dhamma taught
by the Blessed One, it is this same consciousness that runs and
wanders through the round of rebirths, not another. "<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote402anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote402sym"><SUP>cdii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Several bhikkhus, having heard about this, went to the bhikkhu Sati
and asked him: "Friend Sati, is it true that such a pernicious view
has arisen in you?"</P>
<P  >"Exactly
so, friends. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it
is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of
rebirths, not another."</P>
<P  >Then
those bhikkhus, desiring to detach him from that pernicious view,
pressed and questioned and cross-questioned him thus: "Friend Sati,
do not say so. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is not good to
misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus.
For in many discourses the Blessed One has stated consciousness to be
dependently arisen, [257] since without a condition there is no
origination of consciousness."</P>
<P  >Yet
although pressed and questioned and cross-questioned by those
bhikkhus in this way, the bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, still
obstinately adhered to that pernicious view and continued to insist
upon it.</P>
<P  >4.
Since the bhikkhus were unable to detach him from that pernicious
view, they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him,
they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurred, adding:
"Venerable sir, since we could not detach the bhikkhu Sati, son of
a fisherman, from this pernicious view, we have reported this matter
to the Blessed One."</P>
<P  >5.
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: "Come, [258]
bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, in my name that
the Teacher calls him." - "Yes, venerable sir," he replied, and
he went to the bhikkhu Sati and told him: "The Teacher calls you,
friend Sati."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
friend," he replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One then
asked him: "Sati, is it true that the following pernicious view has
arisen in you: 'As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed
One, it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the
round of rebirths, not another'?"</P>
<P  >"Exactly
so, venerable sir. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed
One, it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the
round of rebirths, not another."</P>
<P  >"What
is that consciousness, Sati?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, it is that which speaks and feels and experiences here and there
the result of good and bad actions."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote403anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote403sym"><SUP>cdiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Misguided
man, to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in that way?
Misguided man, in many discourses have I not stated consciousness to
be dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no
origination of consciousness? But you, misguided man, have
misrepresented us by your wrong grasp and injured yourself and stored
up much demerit; for this will lead to your harm and suffering for a
long time."</P>
<P  >6.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, what
do you think? Has this bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, kindled even
a spark of wisdom in this Dhamma and Discipline?"</P>
<P  >"How
could he, venerable sir? No, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, sat silent,
dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and without
response. Then, knowing this, the Blessed One told him: "Misguided
man, you will be recognised by your own pernicious view. I shall
question the bhikkhus on this matter."</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, do you
understand the Dhamma taught by me as this bhikkhu Sati, [259] son of
a fisherman, does when he misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and
injures himself and stores up much demerit?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir. For in many discourses the Blessed One has stated
consciousness to be dependently arisen, since without a condition
there is no origination of consciousness."</P>
<P  >"Good,
bhikkhus. It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me
thus. For in many discourses I have stated consciousness to be
dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no origination
of consciousness. But this bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman,
misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up
much demerit; for this will lead to the harm and suffering of this
misguided man for a long time.</P>
<H3 >(CONDITIONALITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS)</H3>
<P  >8.
"Bhikkhus, consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition
dependent upon which it arises. When consciousness arises dependent
on the eye and forms, it is reckoned as eyeconsciousness; when
consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds, it is reckoned
as ear-consciousness; when consciousness arises dependent on the nose
and odours, [260] it is reckoned as nose-consciousness; when
consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and flavours, it is
reckoned as tongueconsciousness; when consciousness arises dependent
on the body and tangibles, it is reckoned as body-consciousness; when
consciousness arises dependent on the mind and mind-objects, it is
reckoned as mind-consciousness. Just as fire is reckoned by the
particular condition dependent on which it burns - when fire bums
dependent on logs, it is reckoned as a log fire; when fire burns
dependent on faggots, it is reckoned as a faggot fire; when fire
burns dependent on grass, it is reckoned as a grass fire; when fire
burns dependent on cowdung, it is reckoned as a cowdung fire; when
fire burns dependent on chaff, it is reckoned as a chaff fire; when
fire bums dependent on rubbish, it is reckoned as a rubbish fire - so
too, consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent
on which it arises.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote404anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote404sym"><SUP>cdiv</SUP></A></SUP>
When consciousness arises dependent on the eye and forms, it is
reckoned as eye-consciousness ... when consciousness arises dependent
on the mind and mind-objects, it is reckoned as mind-consciousness.</P>

<H3 >(NUTRIMENT AND DEPENDENT ORIGINATION)</H3>
<P  >15.
"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of nutriment for the
maintenance of beings that already have come to be and for the
support of those seeking a new existence. What four? They are:
physical food as nutriment, gross or subtle; contact as the second;
mental volition as the third; and consciousness as the fourth.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote407anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote407sym"><SUP>cdvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >16.
"Now, bhikkhus, these four kinds of nutriment have what as their
source, what as their origin, from what are they born and produced?
These four kinds of nutriment have craving as their source, craving
as their origin; they are born and produced from craving. And this
craving has what as its source ... ? Craving has feeling as its
source ... And this feeling has what as its source ... ? Feeling has
contact as its source ... And this contact has what as its source ...
? Contact has the sixfold base as its source ... And this sixfold

Formations have ignorance as their source, ignorance as their origin;
