55. Jivaka Sutta - To Jivaka</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Mango Grove of Jivaka Komarabhacca.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote573anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote573sym"><SUP>dlxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Then Jivaka Komarabhacca went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >3.
"Venerable sir, I have heard this: 'They slaughter living beings
for the recluse Gotama; the recluse Gotama knowingly eats meat
prepared for him from animals killed for his sake.' Venerable sir,
do those who speak thus say what has been said by the Blessed One,
and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact? Do they
explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing
which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from
their assertions?" [369]</P>
<P  >4.
"Jivaka, those who speak thus do not say what has been said by me,
but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact.</P>
<P  >5.
"Jivaka, I say that there are three instances in which meat should
not be eaten: when it is seen, heard, or suspected [that the living
being has been slaughtered for the bhikkhu]. I say that meat should
not be eaten in these three instances. I say that there are three
instances in which meat may be eaten: when it is not seen, not heard,
and not suspected [that the living being has been slaughtered for the
bhikkhu]. I say that meat may be eaten in these three instances.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote574anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote574sym"><SUP>dlxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
"Here, Jivaka, some bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain
village or town. He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third,
likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to
all as to himself, he abides pervading the allencompassing world with
a mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable,
without hostility and without ill will. Then a householder or a
householder's son comes to him and invites him for the next day's
meal. The bhikkhu accepts, if he likes. When the night is ended, in
the morning he dresses, and taking his bowl and outer robe, goes to
the house of that householder or householder's son and sits down on
a seat made ready. Then the householder or householder's son serves
him with good almsfood. He does not think: 'How good that the
householder or householder's son serves me with good almsfood! If
only a householder or householder's son might serve me with such
good almsfood in the future!' He does not think thus. He eats that
almsfood without being tied to it, infatuated with it, and utterly
committed to it, seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape
from it. What do you think, Jivaka? Would that bhikkhu on such an
occasion choose for his own affliction, or for another's
affliction, or for the affliction of both?" - "No, venerable
sir." - "Does not that bhikkhu sustain himself with blameless
food on that occasion?"</P>
<P  >7.
"Yes, venerable sir. I have heard this, venerable sir: 'Brahma
abides in loving-kindness.' Venerable sir, the Blessed One is my
visible witness to that; for the Blessed One abides in
loving-kindness."</P>
<P  >"Jivaka,
any lust, [370] any hate, any delusion whereby ill will might arise
have been abandoned by the Tathagata, cut off at the root, made like
a palm stump, done away with so that they are no longer subject to
future arising.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote575anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote575sym"><SUP>dlxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
If what you said referred to that, then I allow it to you."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, what I said referred to precisely that."</P>
<P  >8-10.
"Here, Jivaka, a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain village
or town. He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
compassion ... with a mind imbued with appreciative joy ... with a
mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third,
likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to
all as to himself, he abides pervading the all-encompassing world
with a mind imbued with equanimity, abundant, exalted, immeasurable,
without hostility and without ill will. Then a householder or a
householder's son comes to him and invites him for the next day's
meal. The bhikkhu accepts, if he likes ... What do you think, Jivaka?
Would that bhikkhu on such an occasion choose for his own affliction,
or for another's affliction, or for the affliction of both?" -
"No, venerable sir." - "Does not that bhikkhu sustain himself
with blameless food on that occasion?"</P>
<P  >11.
"Yes, venerable sir. I have heard this, venerable sir: 'Brahma
abides in equanimity.' Venerable sir, the Blessed One is my visible
witness to that; for the Blessed One abides in equanimity."</P>
<P  >"Jivaka,
any lust, any hate, any delusion whereby cruelty or discontent or
aversion might arise have been abandoned by the Tathagata, cut off at
the root, made like a palm stump, done away with so that they are no
longer subject to future arising.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote576anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote576sym"><SUP>dlxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
If what you said referred to that, then I allow it to you." [371]</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, what I said referred to precisely that."</P>
<P  >12.
"If anyone slaughters a living being for the Tathagata or his
disciple, he lays up much demerit in five instances. When he says:
'Go and fetch that living being,' this is the first instance in
which he lays up much demerit. When. that living being experiences
pain and grief on being led along with a neck-halter, this is the
second instance in which he lays up much demerit. When he says: 'Go
and slaughter that living being,' this is the third instance in
which he lays up much demerit. When that living being experiences
pain and grief on being slaughtered, this is the fourth instance in
which he lays up much demerit. When he provides the Tathagata or his
disciple with food that is not permissible, this is the fifth
instance in which he lays up much demerit. Anyone who slaughters a
living being for the Tathagata or his disciple lays up much demerit
in these five instances."</P>
<P  >13.
When this was said, Jivaka Komarabhacca said to the Blessed One: "It
is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! The bhikkhus sustain
themselves with permissible food. The bhikkhus sustain themselves
with blameless food. Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent,
venerable sir! ... From today let the Blessed One remember me as a
lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote577anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote577sym"><SUP>dlxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
