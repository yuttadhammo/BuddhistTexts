<P  >[68]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1093anc" HREF="#sdendnote1093sym"><SUP>mxciii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rajagaha, at Isigili -
the Gullet of the Seers. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
“Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One
said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“You see, bhikkhus, do you not, that mountain Vebhara?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1094anc" HREF="#sdendnote1094sym"><SUP>mxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
- “Yes, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“There
used to be another name, another designation, for that mountain
Vebhara. You see, bhikkhus, do you not, that mountain Pandava?” -
“Yes, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“There
used to be another name, another designation, for that mountain
Pandava. You see, bhikkhus, do you not, that mountain Vepulla?” -
“Yes, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“There
used to be another name, another designation, for that mountain
Vepulla. You see, bhikkhus, do you not, that mountain Gijjhakuta -
the Vulture Peak?” - “Yes, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“There
used to be another name, another designation, for that mountain
Gijjhakuta - the Vulture Peak. You see, bhikkhus, do you not, that
mountain Isigili - the Gullet of the Seers?” - “Yes, venerable
sir.”</P>
<P  >3.
“There used to be this same name, this same designation, for this
mountain Isigili - the Gullet of the Seers. For in former times five
hundred paccekabuddhas<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1095anc" HREF="#sdendnote1095sym"><SUP>mxcv</SUP></A></SUP>
dwelt long on this mountain, the Gullet of the Seers. They were seen
entering into this hill; once gone in, they were no longer seen.
People who saw this said: ‘This mountain swallows up these seers.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1096anc" HREF="#sdendnote1096sym"><SUP>mxcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
And so it was that this came to be named ‘The Gullet of the Seers.’
I shall tell you, bhikkhus, the names of the paccekabuddhas, I shall
relate to you the names of the paccekabuddhas, I shall teach you [69]
the names of the paccekabuddhas. Listen and attend closely to what I
shall say.” - “Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The
Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >4.
“Bhikkhus, the paccekabuddha Arittha dwelt long on this mountain
Isigili. The paccekabuddha Uparittha dwelt long on this mountain
Isigili. The paccekabuddha Tagarasikhin<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1097anc" HREF="#sdendnote1097sym"><SUP>mxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
