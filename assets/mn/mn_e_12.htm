12. Mahasihanada Sutta - The Greater Discourse on the Lion's Roar</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Vesali in the grove outside the city to the west.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, had recently
left this Dhamma and Discipline.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote177anc" HREF="#sdendnote177sym"><SUP>clxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
He was making this statement before the Vesali assembly: "The
recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction
in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote178anc" HREF="#sdendnote178sym"><SUP>clxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma [merely] hammered out by
reasoning, following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him, and
when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it leads him when he practises
it to the complete destruction of suffering."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote179anc" HREF="#sdendnote179sym"><SUP>clxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Sariputta dressed, and
taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Vesali for alms. Then he
heard Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, making this statement before
the Vesali assembly. When he had wandered for alms in Vesali and had
returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to the Blessed
One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told
the Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was saying.</P>
<P  >4.
[The Blessed One said:] "Sariputta, the misguided man Sunakkhatta
is angry and his words are spoken out of anger. Thinking to discredit
the Tathagata, he actually praises him; [69] for it is praise of the
Tathagata to say of him: 'When he teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it
leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of
suffering.'</P>
<P  >5.
"Sariputta, this misguided man Sunakkhatta will never infer of me
according to Dhamma: 'That Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote180anc" HREF="#sdendnote180sym"><SUP>clxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
"And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: 'That Blessed
one enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power: having been one,
he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and
vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure,
through a mountain, as though through space; he dives in and out of
the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking
as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space
like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so
powerful and mighty; he wields bodily mastery even as far as the
Brahma-world.'</P>
<P  >7.
"And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: 'With the
divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, that
Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds, the heavenly and the human,
those that are far as well as near.'</P>
<P  >8.
"And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: 'That Blessed
One encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings, other
persons. He understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust
and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; he understands a
mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by
hate as unaffected by hate; he understands a mind affected by
delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as
unaffected by delusion; he understands a contracted mind as
contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; he understands an
exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; he
understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as
unsurpassed; he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and
an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; he understands a liberated
mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated.'</P>
<H5 >(TEN POWERS OF A TATHAGATA)</H5>
<P  >9.
"Sariputta, the Tathagata has these ten Tathagata's powers,
possessing which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his
lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of
Brahma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote181anc" HREF="#sdendnote181sym"><SUP>clxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
What are the ten?</P>
<P  >10.
(1) "Here, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the possible
as possible and the impossible as impossible.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote182anc" HREF="#sdendnote182sym"><SUP>clxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
And that [70] is a Tathagata's power that the Tathagata has, by
virtue of which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's
roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma.</P>
<P  >11.
(2) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the results
of actions undertaken, past, future, and present, with possibilities
and with causes. That too is a Tathagata's power … <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote183anc" HREF="#sdendnote183sym"><SUP>clxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P  >13.
(4) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the world

power … <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote185anc" HREF="#sdendnote185sym"><SUP>clxxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
(5) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is how beings
have different inclinations. That too is a Tathagata's power … <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote186anc" HREF="#sdendnote186sym"><SUP>clxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
(6) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the
disposition of the faculties of other beings, other persons. That too
is a Tathagata's power … <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote187anc" HREF="#sdendnote187sym"><SUP>clxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >16.
(7) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the
defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhanas,
liberations, concentrations, and attainments. That too is a
Tathagata's power … <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote188anc" HREF="#sdendnote188sym"><SUP>clxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >17.
(8) "Again, the Tathagata recollects his manifold past lives, that
is, one birth, two births … (as Sutta 4, §27) … Thus with their
aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. That
too is a Tathagata's power …</P>
<P  >18.
(9) "Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses
the human, the Tathagata sees beings passing away and reappearing,
inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate …
(as Sutta 4, §29) [71] … and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions. That too is a Tathagata's power …</P>
<P  >19.
(10) "Again, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, the
Tathagata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of
mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the
destruction of the taints. That too is a Tathagata's power that the
Tathagata has, by virtue of which he claims the herd-leader's
place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling
the Wheel of Brahma.</P>

"The Tathagata has these ten Tathagata's powers, possessing which
he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the

recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction
in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. The recluse Gotama
teaches a Dhamma [merely] hammered out by reasoning, following his
own line of inquiry as it occurs to him' - unless he abandons that

[surely as if he had been] carried off and put there he will wind up
in hell.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote189anc" HREF="#sdendnote189sym"><SUP>clxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>

<H3 >(FOUR KINDS OF INTREPIDITY)</H3>
<P  >22.
"Sariputta, the Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity,
possessing which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his
lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of
Brahma. What are the four?</P>
<P  >23.
"Here, I see no ground on which any recluse or brahmin or god or
Mara or Brahma or anyone else at all in the world could, in
accordance with the Dhamma, accuse me thus: 'While you claim full
enlightenment, you are not fully enlightened in regard to certain
things.' [72] And seeing no ground for that, I abide in safety,
fearlessness, and intrepidity.</P>
<P  >24.
"1 see no ground on which any recluse … or anyone at all could
accuse me thus: 'While you claim to have destroyed the taints,
these taints are undestroyed by you.' And seeing no ground for
that, I abide in safety, fearlessness, and intrepidity.</P>
<P  >25.
"1 see no ground on which any recluse … or anyone at all could
accuse me thus: 'Those things called obstructions by you are not
able to obstruct one who engages in them.' And seeing no ground for
that, I abide in safety, fearlessness, and intrepidity.</P>
<P  >26.
"1 see no ground on which any recluse … or anyone at all could
accuse me thus: 'When you teach the Dhamma to someone, it does not
lead him when he practises it to the complete destruction of
suffering.' And seeing no ground for that, I abide in safety,
fearlessness, and intrepidity.</P>

<H3 >(THE EIGHT ASSEMBLIES)</H3>
<P  >29.
"Sariputta, there are these eight assemblies. What are the eight?
An assembly of nobles, an assembly of brahmins, an assembly of
householders, an assembly of recluses, an assembly of gods of the
heaven of the Four Great Kings, an assembly of gods of the heaven of
the Thirty-three, an assembly of Mara's retinue, an assembly of
Brahmas. Possessing these four kinds of intrepidity, the Tathagata
approaches and enters these eight assemblies.</P>
<P  >30.
"I recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles …
many hundred assemblies of brahmins … many hundred assemblies of
householders … many hundred assemblies of recluses … many hundred
assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings … many
hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three … many
hundred assemblies of Mara's retinue … many hundred assemblies of
Brahmas. And formerly I had sat with them there and talked with them
and held conversations with them, yet I see no ground for thinking
that fear or timidity might come upon me there. And seeing no ground
for that, I abide in safety, fearlessness, and intrepidity. [73]</P>

"Sariputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me …

<H3 >(FOUR KINDS OF GENERATION)</H3>
<P  >32.
"Sariputta, there are these four kinds of generation. What are the
four? Egg-born generation, womb-born generation, moistureborn
generation, and spontaneous generation.</P>
<P  >33.
"What is egg-born generation? There are these beings born by
breaking out of the shell of an egg; this is called egg-born
generation. What is womb-born generation? There are these beings born
by breaking out from the caul; this is called wombborn generation.
What is moisture-born generation? There are these beings born in a
rotten fish, in a rotten corpse, in rotten dough, in a cesspit, or in
a sewer; this is called moisture-born generation. What is spontaneous
generation? There are gods and denizens of hell and certain human
beings and some beings in the lower worlds; this is called
spontaneous generation. These are the four kinds of generation.</P>

<H3 >(THE FIVE DESTINATIONS AND NIBBANA)</H3>
<P  >35.
"Sariputta, there are these five destinations. What are the five?
Hell, the animal realm, the realm of ghosts, human beings, and gods.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote190anc" HREF="#sdendnote190sym"><SUP>cxc</SUP></A></SUP></P>

pit deeper than a man's height full of glowing coals without flame
or smoke; and then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather,
weary, parched, and thirsty, came by a path going in one way only and
directed to that same charcoal pit. Then a man with good sight on
seeing him would say: 'This person so behaves, so conducts himself,
has taken such a path, that he will come to this same charcoal pit';

<H3 >(THE BODHISATTA'S AUSTERITIES)</H3>
<P  >44.
"Sariputta, I recall having lived a holy life possessing four
factors. I have practised asceticism - the extreme of asceticism; I
have practised coarseness - the extreme of coarseness; I have
practised scrupulousness - the extreme of scrupulousness; I have
practised seclusion - the extreme of seclusion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote193anc" HREF="#sdendnote193sym"><SUP>cxciii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >45.
"Such was my asceticism, Sariputta, that I went naked, rejecting
conventions, licking my hands, not coming when asked, not stopping
when asked; I did not accept food brought or food specially made or
an invitation to a meal; I received nothing from a pot, from a bowl,
across a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating
together, from a pregnant woman, from a woman giving suck, from a
woman lying with a man, from where food was advertised to be
distributed, from where a dog was waiting, from where flies were
buzzing; I accepted no fish or meat, I drank no liquor, wine, or
fermented brew. I kept to one house, to one morsel; I kept to two
[78] houses, to two morsels; … I kept to seven houses, to seven
morsels. I lived on one saucerful a day, on two saucerfuls a day …
on seven saucerfuls a day; I took food once a day, once every two
days … once every seven days, and so on up to once every fortnight;
I dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals. I
was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or hideparings or moss
or ricebran or rice-scum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung. I
lived on forest roots and fruits; I fed on fallen fruits. I clothed
myself in hemp, in hemp-mixed cloth, in shrouds, in refuse rags, in
tree bark, in antelope hide, in strips of antelope hide, in
kusa-grass fabric, in bark fabric, in woodshavings fabric, in
head-hair wool, in animal wool, in owls' wings. I was one who
pulled out hair and beard, pursuing the practice of pulling out hair
and beard. I was one who stood continuously, rejecting seats. I was
one who squatted continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting
position. I was one who used a mattress of spikes; I made a mattress
of spikes my bed. I dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water
three times daily including the evening. Thus in such a variety of
ways I dwelt pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the
body. Such was my asceticism.</P>
<P  >46.
"Such was my coarseness, Sariputta, that just as the bole of a
tinduka tree, accumulating over the years, cakes and flakes off, so
too, dust and dirt, accumulating over the years, caked off my body
and flaked off. It never occurred to me: 'Oh, let me rub this dust
and dirt off with my hand, or let another rub this dust and dirt off
with his hand' - it never occurred to me thus. Such was my
coarseness.</P>
<P  >47.
"Such was my scrupulousness, Sariputta, that I was always mindful
in stepping forwards and stepping backwards. I was full of pity even
for [the beings in] a drop of water thus: 'Let me not hurt the tiny
creatures in the crevices of the ground.' Such was my
scrupulousness.</P>
<P  >48.
"Such was my seclusion, Sariputta, that [79] I would plunge into
some forest and dwell there. And when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd
or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a woodsman, I would flee
from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hollow to hollow,
from hillock to hillock. Why was that? So that they should not see me
or I see them. Just as a forest-bred deer, on seeing human beings,
flees from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hollow to
hollow, from hillock to hillock, so too, when I saw a cowherd or a
shepherd … Such was my seclusion.</P>
<P  >49.
"I would go on all fours to the cow-pens when the cattle had gone
out and the cowherd had left them, and I would feed on the dung of
the young suckling calves. As long as my own excrement and urine
lasted, I fed on my own excrement and urine. Such was my great
distortion in feeding.</P>
<P  >50.
"I would plunge into some awe-inspiring grove and dwell there - a
grove so awe-inspiring that normally it would make a man's hair
stand up if he were not free from lust. When those cold wintry nights
came during the 'eight-days interval of frost,' I would dwell by
night in the open and by day in the grove.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote194anc" HREF="#sdendnote194sym"><SUP>cxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
In the last month of the hot season I would dwell by day in the open
and by night in the grove. And there came to me spontaneously this
stanza never heard before:</P>
<P >
'Chilled by night and scorched by day,</P>
<P >
Alone in awe-inspiring groves,</P>
<P >
Naked, no fire to sit beside,</P>
<P >
The sage yet pursues his quest.'</P>
<P  >51.
"I would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead
for a pillow. And cowherd boys came up and spat on me, urinated on
me, threw dirt at me, and poked sticks into my ears. Yet I do not
recall that I ever aroused an evil mind [of hate] against them. Such
was my abiding in equanimity. [80]</P>
<P  >52.
"Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine
and view is this: 'Purification comes about through food.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote195anc" HREF="#sdendnote195sym"><SUP>cxcv</SUP></A></SUP>
They say: 'Let us live on kola-fruits,' and they eat kolafruits,
they eat kola-fruit powder, they drink kola-fruit water, and they
make many kinds of kola-fruit concoctions. Now I recall having eaten
a single kola-fruit a day. Sariputta, you may think that the
kola-fruit was bigger at that time, yet you should not regard it so:
the kola-fruit was then at most the same size as now. Through feeding
on a single kola-fruit a day, my body reached a state of extreme
emaciation. Because of eating so little my limbs became like the
jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems. Because of eating so
little my backside became like a camel's hoof. Because of eating so
little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads.
Because of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy
rafters of an old roofless barn. Because of eating so little the
gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets, looking like a gleam
of water that has sunk far down in a deep well. Because of eating so
little my scalp shrivelled and withered as a green bitter gourd
shrivels and withers in the wind and sun. Because of eating so little
my belly skin adhered to my backbone; thus if I touched my belly skin
I encountered my backbone, and if I touched my backbone I encountered
my belly skin. Because of eating so little, if I tried to ease my
body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its
roots, fell from my body as I rubbed.</P>
<P  >53-55.
"Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine
and view is this: 'Purification comes about through food.' They
say: 'Let us live on beans,' … 'Let us live on sesamum,' …
'Let us live on rice,' and they eat rice, they eat rice powder,
[81] they drink rice water, and they make many kinds of rice
concoctions. Now I recall having eaten a single rice grain a day.
Sariputta, you may think that the rice grain was bigger at that time,
yet you should not regard it so: the rice grain was then at most the
same size as now. Through feeding on a single rice grain a day, my
body reached a state of extreme emaciation. Because of eating so
little … the hair, rotted at its roots, fell from my body as I
rubbed.</P>
<P  >56.
"Yet, Sariputta, by such conduct, by such practice, by such
performance of austerities, I did not attain any superhuman states,
any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Why
was that? Because I did not attain that noble wisdom which when
attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practises in
accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering.</P>
<P  >57.
"Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine
and view is this: 'Purification comes about through the round of
rebirths.' But it is impossible to find a realm in the round that I
have not already [82] passed through in this long journey, except for
the gods of the Pure Abodes; and had I passed through the round as a
god in the Pure Abodes, I would never have returned to this world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote196anc" HREF="#sdendnote196sym"><SUP>cxcvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >58.
"There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is
this: 'Purification comes about through [some particular kind of]
rebirth.' But it is impossible to find a kind of rebirth that I
have not been reborn in already in this long journey, except for the
gods of the Pure Abodes …</P>
<P  >59.
"There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is
this: 'Purification comes about through [some particular] abode.'
But it is impossible to find a kind of abode that I have not already
dwelt in … except for the gods of the Pure Abodes …</P>
<P  >60.
"There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is
this: 'Purification comes about through sacrifice.' But it is
impossible to find a kind of sacrifice that has not already been
offered up by me in this long journey, when I was either a
head-anointed noble king or a well-to-do brahmin.</P>
<P  >61.
"There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is
this: 'Purification comes through fire-worship.' But it is
impossible to find a kind of fire that has not already been
worshipped by me in this long journey, when I was either a
head-anointed noble king or a well-to-do brahmin.</P>
<P  >62.
"Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine
and view is this: 'As long as this good man is still young, a
black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the
prime of life, so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdom. But when
this good man is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life,
and come to the last stage, being eighty, ninety, or a hundred years
old, then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost.' But it should not be
regarded so. I am now old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in
life, and come to the last stage: my years have turned eighty. Now
suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years' lifespan,
perfect in mindfulness, retentiveness, memory, and lucidity of
wisdom.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote197anc" HREF="#sdendnote197sym"><SUP>cxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as a skilled archer, trained, practised, and tested, could
easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree, suppose
that they were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness,
retentiveness, [83] memory, and lucidity of wisdom. Suppose that they
continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulness and
that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer
of mine and never asked a subsidiary question or paused except to
eat, drink, consume food, taste, urinate, defecate, and rest in order
to remove sleepiness and tiredness. Still the Tathagata's
exposition of the Dhamma, his explanations of factors of the Dhamma,
and his replies to questions would not yet come to an end, but
meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years'
lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred years.
Sariputta, even if you have to carry me about on a bed, still there
will be no change in the lucidity of the Tathagata's wisdom.</P>
<P  >63.
"Rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone: 'A being not
subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and
happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good,
welfare, and happiness of gods and humans,' it is of me indeed that
rightly speaking this should be said."</P>
<P  >64.
Now on that occasion the venerable Nagasamala was standing behind the
Blessed One fanning him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote198anc" HREF="#sdendnote198sym"><SUP>cxcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then he said to the Blessed One: "It is wonderful, venerable sir,
it is marvellous! As I listened to this discourse on the Dhamma, the
hairs of my body stood up. Venerable sir, what is the name of this
discourse on the Dhamma?"</P>
<P  >"As
to that, Nagasamala, you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as
'The Hair-raising Discourse."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote199anc" HREF="#sdendnote199sym"><SUP>cxcix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Nagasamala was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
