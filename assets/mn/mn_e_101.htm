101. Devadaha Sutta - At Devadaha</H2>
<P  >[214]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named Devadaha. There the
Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable
sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, there are some recluses and brahmins who hold such a
doctrine and view as this: 'Whatever this person feels, whether
pleasure or pain or neither-pain-nor-pleasure, all that is caused by
what was done in the past.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote922anc" HREF="#sdendnote922sym"><SUP>cmxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
So by annihilating with asceticism past actions<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote923anc" HREF="#sdendnote923sym"><SUP>cmxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
and by doing no fresh actions, there will be no consequence in the
future. With no consequence in the future, there is the destruction
of action. With the destruction of action, there is the destruction
of suffering. With the destruction of suffering, there is the
destruction of feeling. With the destruction of feeling, all
suffering will be exhausted.' So speak the Niganthas, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >3.
"I go to the Niganthas who speak thus and I say: 'Friend
Niganthas, is it true that you hold such a doctrine and view as this:
"Whatever this person feels … all suffering will be exhausted"?'
If, when they are asked thus, the Niganthas admit this and say 'Yes,'
I say to them:</P>
<P  >4.
"'But, friends, do you know that you existed in the past, and
that it is not the case that you did not exist?' - 'No, friend.'
- 'But, friends, do you know that you did evil actions in the past
and did not abstain from them?' - 'No, friend.' - 'But,
friends, do you know that so much suffering has already been
exhausted, or that so much suffering has still to be exhausted, or
that when so much suffering has been exhausted all suffering will
have been exhausted?' - [215] 'No, friend.' - 'But, friends,
do you know what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the
cultivation of wholesome states is here and now?' - 'No, friend.'</P>
<P  >5.
"'So, friends, it seems that you do not know that you existed in
the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist; or that
you did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them; or
that you did such and such evil actions; or that so much suffering
has already been exhausted, or that so much suffering has still to be
exhausted, or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all
suffering will have been exhausted; or what the abandoning of
unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is
here and now. That being so, it is not fitting for the venerable
Niganthas to declare: "Whatever this person feels, whether pleasure
or pain or neither-painnor-pleasure, all that is caused by what was
done in the past. So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and
by doing no fresh actions, there will be no consequence in the
future. With no consequence in the future … all suffering will be
exhausted."</P>
<P  >6.
"'If, friend Niganthas, you knew that you existed in the past and
that it is not the case that you did not exist; or that you did evil
actions in the past and did not abstain from them; or that you did
such and such evil actions; or that so much suffering has already
been. exhausted, or that so much suffering has still to be exhausted,
or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all suffering will
have been exhausted; or what the abandoning of unwholesome states is
and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now; that
being so, it would be fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare:
"Whatever this person feels … [216] … all suffering will be
exhausted."</P>
<P  >7.
"'Friend Niganthas, suppose a man were wounded by an arrow
thickly smeared with poison, and because of this he felt painful,
racking, piercing feelings. Then his friends and companions, kinsmen
and relatives, brought a surgeon. The surgeon would cut around the
opening of the wound with a knife, probe for the arrow with a probe,
pull out the arrow, and apply a medicinal cauteriser to the opening
of the wound, and at each step the man would feel painful, racking,
piercing feelings. Then on a later occasion, when the wound was
healed and covered with skin, the man would be well and happy,
independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. He might
think: "Formerly I was pierced by an arrow thickly smeared with
poison, and because of this I felt painful, racking, piercing
feelings. Then my friends and companions, kinsmen and relatives,
brought a surgeon. The surgeon cut around the opening of the wound
with a knife, probed for the arrow with a probe, pulled out the
arrow, and applied a medicinal cauteriser to the opening of the
wound, and at each step I felt painful, racking, piercing feelings.
[217] But now that the wound is healed and covered with skin, I am
well and happy, independent, my own master, able to go where I like."</P>
<P  >8.
"'So too, friend Niganthas, if you knew that you existed in the
past and that it is not the case that you did not exist … or what
the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of
wholesome states is here and now; that being so, it would be fitting
for the venerable Niganthas to declare: "Whatever this person feels
… all suffering will be exhausted."</P>
<P  >9.
"'But since, friend Niganthas, you do not know that you existed
in the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist … or
what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation
of wholesome states is here and now, it is not fitting for the
venerable Niganthas to declare: "Whatever this person feels … all
suffering will be exhausted.'"</P>
<P  >10.
"When this was said, the Niganthas told me: [218] 'Friend, the
Nigantha Nataputta is omniscient and all-seeing and claims to have
complete knowledge and vision thus: "Whether I am walking or
standing or asleep or awake, knowledge and vision are continuously
and uninterruptedly present to me." He says thus: "Niganthas, you
have done evil actions in the past; exhaust them with the performance
of piercing austerities. And when you are here and now restrained in
body, speech, and mind, that is doing no evil actions for the future.
So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh
actions, there will be no consequence in the future. With no
consequence in the future … all suffering will be exhausted." We
approve of and accept this, and so we are satisfied.'</P>
<P  >11.
"When this was said, I told the Niganthas:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote924anc" HREF="#sdendnote924sym"><SUP>cmxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
'There are five things, friend Niganthas, that may turn out in two
different ways here and now. What five? They are: faith, approval,
oral tradition, reasoned cogitation, and reflective acceptance of a
view. These five things may turn out in two different ways here and
now. Herein, what kind of faith do the venerable Niganthas have in a
teacher who speaks about the past? What kind of approval, what kind
of oral tradition, what kind of reasoned cogitation, what kind of
reflective acceptance of a view?' Speaking thus, bhikkhus, I did
not see any legitimate defence of their position by the Niganthas.</P>
<P  >12.
"Again, bhikkhus, I said to the Niganthas: 'What do you think,
friend Niganthas? When there is intense exertion, intense striving,
do you then feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to intense
exertion? But when there is no intense exertion, no intense striving,
do you then not feel any painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
intense exertion?' - 'When there is intense exertion, friend
Gotama, intense striving, then we feel painful, racking, piercing
feelings due to intense exertion; [219] but when there is no intense
exertion, no intense striving, then we do not feel any painful,
racking, piercing feelings due to intense exertion.'</P>
<P  >13.
"'So it seems, friend Niganthas, that when there is intense
exertion … you feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
intense exertion; but when there is no intense exertion … you do
not feel any painful, racking, piercing feelings due to intense
exertion. That being so, it is not fitting for the venerable
Niganthas to declare:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote925anc" HREF="#sdendnote925sym"><SUP>cmxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
"Whatever this person feels, whether pleasure or pain or
neither-pain-nor-pleasure, all that is caused by what was done in the
past. So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no
fresh actions, there will be no consequence in the future. With no
consequence … all suffering will be exhausted."</P>
<P  >14.
"'If, friend Niganthas, when there was intense exertion, intense
striving, then painful, racking, piercing feelings due to intense
exertion were present, and when there was no intense exertion, no
intense striving, then painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
intense exertion were still present; that being so, it would be
fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare: "Whatever this
person feels … all suffering will be exhausted."</P>
<P  >15.
"'But since, friend Niganthas, when there is intense exertion,
intense striving, then you feel painful, racking, piercing feelings
due to intense exertion, but when there is no intense exertion, no
intense striving, then you do not feel painful, racking, piercing
feelings due to intense exertion, you are therefore feeling only the
painful, racking, piercing feelings of your self imposed exertion,
and it is through ignorance, unknowing, and delusion [220] that you
mistakenly hold: "Whatever this person feels … all suffering will
be exhausted.'"Speaking thus, bhikkhus, I did not see any
legitimate defence of their position by the Niganthas.</P>
<P  >16.
"Again, bhikkhus, I said to the Niganthas: 'What do you think,
friend Niganthas? Is it possible that an action [whose result] is to
be experienced here and now<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote926anc" HREF="#sdendnote926sym"><SUP>cmxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
can, through exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to
be experienced in the next life?' - 'No, friend.' - 'But is

<P  >17.

as pleasant?' -'No, friend.'</P>
<P  >18.
"'What do you think, friend Niganthas? Is it possible that an
action [whose result] is to be experienced in a matured [personality]

<P  >19.
"'What do you think, friend Niganthas? [221] Is it possible that
an action [whose result] is to be much experienced can, through
exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be little
experienced?' - 'No, friend.' - 'But is it possible that an

<P  >21.
"'So it seems, friend Niganthas, that it is impossible that an

exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be experienced
in the next life, and impossible that an action [whose result] is to
be experienced in the next life can, through exertion and striving,
become one [whose result] is to be experienced here and now;
impossible that an action [whose result] is to be experienced as
pleasant can, through exertion and striving, become one [whose
result] is to be experienced as painful, and impossible that an
action [whose result] is to be experienced as painful can, through
exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be experienced
as pleasant; impossible that an action [whose result] is to be

exertion is fruitless, [222] their striving is fruitless.'</P>
<P  >22.
"So speak the Niganthas, bhikkhus. And because the Niganthas speak
thus, there are ten legitimate deductions from their assertions that
provide ground for censuring them:</P>
<P  >(1)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was
done in the past, then the Niganthas surely must have done bad deeds
in the past, since they now feel such painful, racking, piercing
feelings.</P>
<P  >(2)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the
creative act of a Supreme God,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote929anc" HREF="#sdendnote929sym"><SUP>cmxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
then the Niganthas surely must have been created by an evil Supreme
God, since they now feel such painful, racking, piercing feelings.</P>
<P  >(3)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by
circumstance and nature,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote930anc" HREF="#sdendnote930sym"><SUP>cmxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
then the Niganthas surely must have bad luck, since they now feel
such painful, racking, piercing feelings.</P>
<P  >(4)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class
[among the six classes of birth]<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote931anc" HREF="#sdendnote931sym"><SUP>cmxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
then the Niganthas surely must belong to a bad class, since they now
feel such painful, racking, piercing feelings.</P>
<P  >(5)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion
here and now, then the Niganthas surely must strive badly here and
now, since they now feel such painful, racking, piercing feelings.</P>
<P  >(6)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was
done in the past, then the Niganthas are to be censured; if not, then
the Niganthas are still to be censured.</P>
<P  >(7)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the
creative act of a Supreme God, then the Niganthas are to be censured;
if not, they are still to be censured.</P>
<P  >(8)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by chance,
then the Niganthas are to be censured; if not, they are still to be
censured.</P>
<P  >(9)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class,
then the Niganthas are to be censured; if not, they are still to be
censured.</P>
<P  >(10)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion
here and now, [223] then the Niganthas are to be censured; if not,
they are still to be censured.</P>
<P  >"So
speak the Niganthas, bhikkhus. And because the Niganthas speak thus,
these ten legitimate deductions from their assertions provide grounds
for censuring them. Thus their exertion is fruitless, their striving
is fruitless.</P>
<P  >23.
"And how is exertion fruitful, bhikkhus, how is striving fruitful?
Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is not overwhelmed by suffering and does
not overwhelm himself with suffering; and he does not give up the
pleasure that accords with Dhamma, yet he is not infatuated with that
pleasure.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote932anc" HREF="#sdendnote932sym"><SUP>cmxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
He knows thus: 'When I strive with determination, this particular
source of suffering fades away in me because of that determined
striving; and when I look on with equanimity, this particular source
of suffering fades away in me while I develop equanimity.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote933anc" HREF="#sdendnote933sym"><SUP>cmxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
He strives with determination in regard to that particular source of
suffering which fades away in him because of that determined
striving; and he develops equanimity in regard to that particular
source of suffering which fades away in him while he is developing
equanimity. When he strives with determination, such and such a
source of suffering fades away in him because of that determined
striving; thus that suffering is exhausted in him. When he looks on
with equanimity, such and such a source of suffering fades away in
him while he develops equanimity; thus that suffering is exhausted in
him.</P>
<P  >24.
"Suppose, bhikkhus, a man loved a woman with his mind bound to her
by intense desire and passion. He might see that woman standing with
another man, chatting, joking, and laughing. What do you think,
bhikkhus? Would not sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair
arise in that man when he sees that woman standing with another man,
chatting, joking, and laughing?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because that man loves that woman with
his mind bound to her by intense desire and passion; [224] that is
why sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair would arise in him
when he sees her standing with another man, chatting, joking, and
laughing."</P>
<P  >25.
"Then, bhikkhus, the man might think: 'I love this woman with my
mind bound to her by intense desire and passion; thus sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise in me when I see her
standing with another man, chatting, joking, and laughing. What if I
were to abandon my desire and lust for that woman?' He would
abandon his desire and lust for that woman. On a later occasion he
might see that woman standing with another man, chatting, joking, and
laughing. What do you think, bhikkhus? Would sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair arise in that man when he sees that woman
standing with another man … ?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because that man no longer loves that
woman; that is why sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair do
not arise in him when he sees that woman standing with another man …
"</P>
<P  >26.
"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is not overwhelmed by suffering
and does not overwhelm himself with suffering … (as in §23 above)
[225] … thus that suffering is exhausted in him. Thus, bhikkhus,
the exertion is fruitful, the striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >27.
"Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu considers thus: 'While I live
according to my pleasure, unwholesome states increase in me and
wholesome states diminish; but when I exert myself in what is
painful, unwholesome states diminish in me and wholesome states
increase. What if I exert myself in what is painful?' He exerts
himself in what is painful. When he does so, unwholesome states
diminish in him and wholesome states increase.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote934anc" HREF="#sdendnote934sym"><SUP>cmxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
At a later time he does not exert himself in what is painful. Why is
that? The purpose for which that bhikkhu exerted himself in what is
painful has been achieved; that is why at a later time he does not
exert himself in what is painful.</P>
<P  >28.
"Suppose, bhikkhus, an arrowsmith were warming and heating an arrow
shaft between two flames, making it straight and workable. When the
arrow shaft had been warmed and heated between the two flames and had
been made straight and workable, then at a later time he would not
again warm and heat the arrow shaft and make it straight and
workable. Why is that? The purpose for which that arrowsmith had
warmed and heated the arrow and made it straight and workable has
been achieved; that is why at a later time he would not again warm
and heat the arrow shaft and make it straight and workable.</P>
<P  >29.
"So too, a bhikkhu considers thus … (as in §27 above) [226] …
that is why at a later time he does not exert himself in what is
painful. Thus too, bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the striving
is fruitful.</P>
<P  >30-37.
"Again, bhikkhus, here a Tathagata appears in the world,
accomplished, fully enlightened … (as Sutta 51, §§12-19) … he
purifies his mind from doubt.</P>
<P  >38.
"Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. Thus too, bhikkhus, the
exertion is fruitful, the striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >39.
"Again, bhikkhus, with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which
has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.
Thus too, bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the striving is
fruitful.</P>
<P  >40.
"Again, bhikkhus, with the fading away as well of rapture, a
bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still
feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the
third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a
pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.' Thus too,
bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >41.
"Again, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and
with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity. Thus too, bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the
striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >42.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one
birth, two births … (as Sutta 51, §24) … Thus with their aspects
and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. Thus too,
bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >43.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 51, §25) … Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions. Thus too, bhikkhus, the exertion is
fruitful, the striving is fruitful. [227]</P>
<P  >44.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the</P>
<P  >destruction
of the taints. He understands as it actually is: 'This is
suffering'; … 'This is the origin of suffering'; … 'This
is the cessation of suffering'; … 'This is the way leading to
the cessation of suffering'; … 'These are the taints'; …
'This is the origin of the taints'; … 'This is the cessation
of the taints'; … 'This is the way leading to the cessation of
the taints.'</P>
<P  >45.
"When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'It is
liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.' Thus too, bhikkhus, the exertion is
fruitful, the striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >46.
"So the Tathagata speaks, bhikkhus. And because the Tathagata
speaks thus, there are ten legitimate grounds for praising him:</P>
<P  >(1)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was
done in the past, then the Tathagata surely must have done good deeds
in the past, since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelings.</P>
<P  >(2)
"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the
creative act of a Supreme God, then the Tathagata surely must have
been created by a good Supreme God, since he now feels such taintless

"If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion
here and now, then the Tathagata is to be praised; if not, [228] then

<P  >"So
the Tathagata speaks, bhikkhus. And because the Tathagata speaks
thus, there are these ten legitimate grounds for praising him."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
