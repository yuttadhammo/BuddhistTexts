<P  >[299]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Then the
lay follower Visakha went to the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote459anc" HREF="#sdendnote459sym"><SUP>cdlix</SUP></A></SUP>
and after paying homage to her, he sat down at one side and asked
her:</P>
<H3 >(PERSONALITY)</H3>
<P  >2.
"Lady, 'personality, personality' is said. What is called
personality by the Blessed One?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, these five aggregates affected by clinging are called
personality by the Blessed One; that is, the material form aggregate
affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the
perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate
affected by clinging, and the consciousness aggregate affected by
clinging. These five aggregates affected by clinging are called
personality by the Blessed One."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote460anc" HREF="#sdendnote460sym"><SUP>cdlx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Saying,
"Good, lady," the lay follower Visakha delighted and rejoiced in
the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna's words. Then he asked her a further
question:</P>
<P  >3.
"Lady, 'origin of personality, origin of personality' is said.
What is called the origin of personality by the Blessed One?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, it is craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied
by delight and lust, and delights in this and that; that is, craving
for sensual pleasures, craving for being, and craving for non-being.
This is called the origin of personality by the Blessed One."</P>
<P  >4.
"Lady, 'cessation of personality, cessation of personality' is
said. What is called the cessation of personality by the Blessed
One?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, it is the remainderless fading away and ceasing, the giving
up, relinquishing, letting go, and rejecting of that same craving.
This is called the cessation of personality by the Blessed One."</P>
<P  >5.
"Lady, 'the way leading to the cessation of personality, the way
leading to the cessation of personality' is said. What is called
the way leading to the cessation of personality by the Blessed One?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, it is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view,
right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration."</P>
<P  >6.
"Lady, is that clinging the same as these five aggregates affected
by clinging, or is the clinging something apart from the five
aggregates affected by clinging?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, that clinging is neither the same as these five aggregates
affected by clinging [300] nor is clinging something apart from the
five aggregates affected by clinging. It is the desire and lust in
regard to the five aggregates affected by clinging that is the
clinging there."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote461anc" HREF="#sdendnote461sym"><SUP>cdlxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(PERSONALITY VIEW)</H3>
<P  >7.
"Lady, how does personality view come to be?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
friend Visakha, an untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for
noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who
has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in
their Dhamma, regards material form as self, or self as possessed of
material form, or material form as in self, or self as in material
form. He regards feeling as self, or self as possessed of feeling, or
feeling as in self, or self as in feeling. He regards perception as
self, or self as possessed of perception, or perception as in self,
or self as in perception. He regards formations as self, or self as
possessed of formations, or formations as in self, or self as in
formations. He regards consciousness as self, or self as possessed of
consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in
consciousness. That is how personality view comes to be."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote462anc" HREF="#sdendnote462sym"><SUP>cdlxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
"Lady, how does personality view not come to be?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
friend Visakha, a well-taught noble disciple, who has regard for
noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has
regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma,
does not regard material form as self, or self as possessed of
material form, or material form as in self, or self as in material
form. He does not regard feeling as self, or self as possessed of
feeling, or feeling as in self, or self as in feeling. He does not
regard perception as self, or self as possessed of perception, or
perception as in self, or self as in perception. He does not regard
formations as self, or self as possessed of formations, or formations
as in self, or self as in formations. He does not regard
consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or
consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how
personality view does not come to be."</P>
<H3 >(THE NOBLE EIGHTFOLD PATH)</H3>
<P  >9.
"Lady, what is the Noble Eightfold Path?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, it is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view,
right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration."</P>
<P  >10.
"Lady, is the Noble Eightfold Path conditioned or unconditioned?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, the Noble Eightfold Path is [301] conditioned." 11. "Lady,
are the three aggregates included by the Noble Eightfold Path, or is
the Noble Eightfold Path included by the three aggregates?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote463anc" HREF="#sdendnote463sym"><SUP>cdlxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"The
three aggregates are not included by the Noble Eightfold Path, friend
Visakha, but the Noble Eightfold Path is included by the three
aggregates. Right speech, right action, and right livelihood - these
states are included in the aggregate of virtue. Right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration - these states are included in
the aggregate of concentration. Right view and right intention -
these states are included in the aggregate of wisdom."</P>
<H3 >(CONCENTRATION)</H3>
<P  >12.
"Lady, what is concentration? What is the basis of concentration?
What is the equipment of concentration? What is the development of
concentration?"</P>
<P  >"Unification
of mind, friend Visakha, is concentration; the four foundations of
mindfulness are the basis of concentration; the four right kinds of
striving are the equipment of concentration; the repetition,
development, and cultivation of these same states is the development
of concentration therein."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote464anc" HREF="#sdendnote464sym"><SUP>cdlxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(FORMATIONS)</H3>
<P  >13.
"Lady, how many formations are there?"</P>
<P  >"There
are these three formations, friend Visakha: the bodily formation, the
verbal formation, and the mental formation."</P>
<P  >14.
"But, lady, what is the bodily formation? What is the verbal
formation? What is the mental formation?"</P>
<P  >"In-breathing
and out-breathing, friend Visakha, are the bodily formation; applied
thought and sustained thought are the verbal formation; perception
and feeling are the mental formation."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote465anc" HREF="#sdendnote465sym"><SUP>cdlxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
"But, lady, why are in-breathing and out-breathing the bodily
formation? Why are applied thought and sustained thought the verbal
formation? Why are perception and feeling the mental formation?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, in-breathing and out-breathing are bodily, these are states
bound up with the body; that is why in-breathing and out-breathing
are the bodily formation. First one applies thought and sustains
thought, and subsequently one breaks out into speech; that is why
applied thought and sustained thought are the verbal formation.
Perception and feeling are mental, these are states bound up with the
mind; that is why perception and feeling are the mental formation."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote466anc" HREF="#sdendnote466sym"><SUP>cdlxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(THE ATTAINMENT OF CESSATION)</H3>
<P  >16.
"Lady, how does the attainment of the cessation of perception and
feeling come to be?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and
feeling, it does not occur to him: 'I shall attain the cessation of
perception and feeling,' or 'I am attaining the cessation of
perception and feeling,' or 'I have attained the cessation of
perception and feeling'; but rather his mind has previously been
developed in such a way that it leads him to that state."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote467anc" HREF="#sdendnote467sym"><SUP>cdlxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
[302]</P>
<P  >17.
"Lady, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and
feeling, which states cease first in him: the bodily formation, the
verbal formation, or the mental formation?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and
feeling, first the verbal formation ceases, then the bodily
formation, then the mental formation."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote468anc" HREF="#sdendnote468sym"><SUP>cdlxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >18.
"Lady, how does emergence from the attainment of the cessation of
perception and feeling come to be?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, it does not occur to him: 'I
shall emerge from the attainment of the cessation of perception and
feeling,' or 'I am emerging from the attainment of the cessation
of perception and feeling,' or 'I have emerged from the
attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling'; but rather
his mind has previously been developed in such a way that it leads
him to that state."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote469anc" HREF="#sdendnote469sym"><SUP>cdlxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >19.
"Lady, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, which states arise first in him:
the bodily formation, the verbal formation, or the mental formation?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, first the mental formation
arises, then the bodily formation, then the verbal formation."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote470anc" HREF="#sdendnote470sym"><SUP>cdlxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >20.
"Lady, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact touch
him?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, three kinds of contact touch
him: voidness contact, signless contact, desireless contact."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote471anc" HREF="#sdendnote471sym"><SUP>cdlxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >21.
"Lady, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, to what does his mind incline,
to what does it lean, to what does it tend?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, his mind inclines to seclusion,
leans to seclusion, tends to seclusion."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote472anc" HREF="#sdendnote472sym"><SUP>cdlxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(FEELING)</H3>
<P  >22.
"Lady, how many kinds of feeling are there?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, there are three kinds of feeling: pleasant feeling, painful
feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."</P>
<P  >23.
"But, lady, what is pleasant feeling? What is painful feeling? What
is neither painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, whatever is felt bodily or mentally as pleasant and soothing
is pleasant feeling. Whatever is felt bodily or mentally as painful
and hurting is painful feeling. Whatever is felt bodily or mentally
as neither soothing nor hurting [303] is neither-painful-nor-pleasant
feeling."</P>
<P  >24.
"Lady, what is pleasant and what is painful in regard to pleasant
feeling? What is painful and what is pleasant in regard to painful
feeling? What is pleasant and what is painful in regard to
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, pleasant feeling is pleasant when it persists and painful
when it changes. Painful feeling is painful when it persists and
pleasant when it changes. Neither-painful-norpleasant feeling is
pleasant when there is knowledge [of it] and painful when there is no
knowledge [of it]."</P>
<H3 >(UNDERLYING TENDENCIES)</H3>
<P  >25.
"Lady, what underlying tendency underlies pleasant feeling? What
underlying tendency underlies painful feeling? What underlying
tendency underlies neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, the underlying tendency to lust underlies pleasant feeling.
The underlying tendency to aversion underlies painful feeling. The
underlying tendency to ignorance underlies
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote473anc" HREF="#sdendnote473sym"><SUP>cdlxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >26.
"Lady, does the underlying tendency to lust underlie all pleasant
feeling? Does the underlying tendency to aversion underlie all
painful feeling? Does the underlying tendency to ignorance underlie
all neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, the underlying tendency to lust does not underlie all
pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to aversion does not
underlie all painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance
does not underlie all neither-painful-norpleasant feeling."</P>
<P  >27.
"Lady, what should be abandoned in regard to pleasant feeling? What
should be abandoned in regard to painful feeling? What should be
abandoned in regard to neither-painful-norpleasant feeling?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, the underlying tendency to lust should be abandoned in
regard to pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to aversion
should be abandoned in regard to painful feeling. The underlying
tendency to ignorance should be abandoned in regard to
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."</P>
<P  >28.
"Lady, does the underlying tendency to lust have to be abandoned in
regard to all pleasant feeling? Does the underlying tendency to
aversion have to be abandoned in regard to all painful feeling? Does
the underlying tendency to ignorance have to be abandoned in regard
to all neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, the underlying tendency to lust does not have to be
abandoned in regard to all pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency
to aversion does not have to be abandoned in regard to all painful
feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance does not have to be
abandoned in regard to all neitherpainful-nor-pleasant feeling.</P>
<P  >"Here,
friend Visakha, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. With that he abandons lust,
and the underlying tendency to lust does not underlie that.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote474anc" HREF="#sdendnote474sym"><SUP>cdlxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Here
a bhikkhu considers thus: 'When shall I enter upon and abide in
that base that the noble ones now enter upon and abide in?' In one
who thus generates a longing for the supreme liberations, [304] grief
arises with that longing as condition. With that he abandons
aversion, and the underlying tendency to aversion does not underlie
that.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote475anc" HREF="#sdendnote475sym"><SUP>cdlxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Here,
with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous
disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in
the fourth jhana, which has neither-painnor-pleasure and purity of
mindfulness due to equanimity. With that he abandons ignorance, and
the underlying tendency to ignorance does not underlie that."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote476anc" HREF="#sdendnote476sym"><SUP>cdlxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(COUNTERPARTS)</H3>
<P  >29.
"Lady, what is the counterpart of pleasant feeling?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote477anc" HREF="#sdendnote477sym"><SUP>cdlxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
"Friend Visakha, painful feeling is the counterpart of pleasant
feeling."</P>
<P  >"What
is the counterpart of painful feeling?" "Pleasant feeling is the
counterpart of painful feeling."</P>
<P  >"What
is the counterpart of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"</P>
<P  >"Ignorance
is the counterpart of neither-painful-nor pleasant feeling."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote478anc" HREF="#sdendnote478sym"><SUP>cdlxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"What
is the counterpart of ignorance?"</P>
<P  >"True
knowledge is the counterpart of ignorance." "What is the
counterpart of true knowledge?" "Deliverance is the counterpart
of true knowledge." "What is the counterpart of deliverance?"
"Nibbana is the counterpart of deliverance." "Lady, what is the
counterpart of Nibbana?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Visakha, you have pushed this line of questioning too far; you were
not able to grasp the limit to questions.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote479anc" HREF="#sdendnote479sym"><SUP>cdlxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
For the holy life, friend Visakha, merges in Nibbana, culminates in
Nibbana, ends in Nibbana. If you wish, friend Visakha, go to the
Blessed One and ask him about the meaning of this. As the Blessed One
explains it to you, so you should remember it."</P>
<H3 >(CONCLUSION)</H3>
<P  >30.
Then the lay follower Visakha, having delighted and rejoiced in the
bhikkhuni Dhammadinna's words, rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to her, keeping her on his right, he went to the Blessed One.
After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told the
Blessed One his entire conversation with the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna.
When he finished speaking, the Blessed One told him:</P>
<P  >31.
"The bhikkhuni Dhammadinna is wise, Visakha, the bhikkhuni
Dhammadinna has great wisdom. If you had asked me the meaning of
this, I would have explained it to you [305] in the same way that the
bhikkhunl Dhammadinna has explained it. Such is its meaning, and so
you should remember it."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote480anc" HREF="#sdendnote480sym"><SUP>cdlxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The lay follower Visakha was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
