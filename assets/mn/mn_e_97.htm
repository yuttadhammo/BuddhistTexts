97. Dhananjani Sutta - To Dhananjani</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was wandering in the
Southern Hills with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. Then a certain [185]
bhikkhu who had spent the Rains at Rajagaha went to the venerable
Sariputta in the Southern Hills and exchanged greetings with him.
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and the venerable Sariputta asked him: "Is the Blessed One
well and strong, friend?"</P>
<P  >"The
Blessed One is well and strong, friend."</P>
<P  >"Is
the Sangha of bhikkhus well and strong, friend?"</P>
<P  >"The
Sangha of bhikkhus too is well and strong, friend."</P>
<P  >"Friend,
there is a brahmin named Dhananjani living in Rajagaha at the
Tandulapala Gate. Is that brahmin Dhananjani well and strong?"</P>
<P  >"That
brahmin Dhananjani too is well and strong, friend."</P>
<P  >"Is
he diligent, friend?"</P>
<P  >"How
could he be diligent, friend? He plunders brahmin householders in the
name of the king, and he plunders the king in the name of the brahmin
householders. His wife, who had faith and came from a clan with
faith, has died and he has taken another wife, a woman without faith
who comes from a clan without faith."</P>
<P  >"This
is bad news that we hear, friend. It is bad news indeed to hear that
the brahmin Dhananjani has become negligent. Perhaps sometime or
other we might meet the brahmin Dhananjani and have some conversation
with him."</P>
<P  >3.
Then, having stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he chose, the
venerable Sariputta set out to wander towards</P>
<P  >Rajagaha.
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Rajagaha, and there he
lived in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >4.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Sariputta dressed, and
taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Rajagaha for alms. [186]
Now at that time the brahmin Dhananjani was having his cows milked in
a cowshed outside the city. So when the venerable Sariputta had
wandered for alms in Rajagaha and had returned from his almsround,
after his meal he went to the brahmin Dhananjani. The brahmin
Dhananjani saw the venerable Sariputta coming in the distance, and he
went to him and said: "Drink some of this fresh milk, Master
Sariputta, until it is time for the meal."</P>
<P  >"Enough,
brahmin, I have finished my meal for today. I shall be at the root of
that tree for the day's abiding. You may come there." "Yes,
sir," he replied.</P>
<P  >5.
And then, after he had eaten his morning meal, the brahmin Dhananjani
went to the venerable Sariputta and exchanged greetings with him.
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and the venerable Sariputta asked him: "Are you diligent,
Dhananjani?"</P>
<P  >"How
can we be diligent, Master Sariputta, when we have to support our
parents, our wife and children, and our slaves, servants, and
workers; when we have to do our duty towards our friends and
companions, towards our kinsmen and relatives, towards our guests,
towards our departed ancestors, towards the deities, and towards the
king; and when this body must also be refreshed and nourished?"</P>
<P  >6.
"What do you think, Dhananjani? Suppose someone here were to behave
contrary to the Dhamma, to behave unrighteously for the sake of his
parents, and then because of such behaviour the wardens of hell were
to drag him off to hell. Would he be able [to free himself by
pleading thus]: 'It was for the sake of my parents that I behaved
contrary to the Dhamma, that I behaved unrighteously, so let not the
wardens of hell [drag me off] to hell'? [187] Or would his parents
be able [to free him by pleading thus]: 'It was for our sake that
he behaved contrary to the Dhamma, that he behaved unrighteously, so
let not the wardens of hell [drag him off] to hell'?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Sariputta. Even while he was crying out, the wardens of hell
would fling him into hell."</P>
<P  >7-15.
"What do you think, Dhananjani? Suppose someone here were to behave
contrary to the Dhamma, to behave unrighteously for the sake of his
wife and children … for the sake of his slaves, servants, and
workers … for the sake of his friends and companions … for the
sake of his kinsmen and relatives … for the sake of his guests …
[188] for the sake of his departed ancestors.. .for the sake of the
deities … for the sake of the king … for the sake of refreshing
and nourishing this body, and because of such. behaviour the wardens
of hell were to drag him off to hell. Would he be able [to free
himself by pleading thus]: 'It was for the sake of refreshing and
nourishing this body that I behaved contrary to the Dhamma, that I
behaved unrighteously, so let not the wardens of hell [drag me off]
to hell'? Or would others be able [to free him by pleading thus]:
'It was for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body that he
behaved contrary to the Dhamma, that he behaved unrighteously, so let
not the wardens of hell [drag him off] to hell'?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Sariputta. Even while he was crying out, the wardens of hell
would fling him into hell."</P>
<P  >16.
"What do you think, Dhananjani? Who is the better, one who for the
sake of his parents behaves contrary to the Dhamma, behaves
unrighteously, or one who for the sake of his parents behaves
according to the Dhamma, behaves righteously?"</P>
<P  >"Master
Sariputta, the one who for the sake of his parents behaves contrary
to the Dhamma, behaves unrighteously, is not the better; the one who
for the sake of his parents behaves according to the Dhamma, behaves
righteously, is the better."</P>
<P  >"Dhananjani,
there are other kinds of work, profitable and in accordance with the
Dhamma, by means of which one can support one's parents and at the
same time both avoid doing evil and practise merit.</P>
<P  >17-25.
"What do you think, Dhananjani? Who is the better, one who for the
sake of his wife and children … [189] … for the sake of his
slaves, servants, and workers … for the sake of his friends and
companions … [190] … for the sake of his kinsmen and relatives …
for the sake of his guests … for the sake of his departed ancestors
… for the sake of the deities … [191] … for the sake of the
king … for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body behaves
contrary to the Dhamma, behaves unrighteously, or one who for the
sake of refreshing and nourishing this body behaves according to the
Dhamma, behaves righteously?"</P>
<P  >"Master
Sariputta, the one who for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this
body behaves contrary to the Dhamma, behaves unrighteously, is not
the better; the one who for the sake of refreshing and nourishing
this body behaves according to the Dhamma, behaves righteously, is
the better."</P>
<P  >"Dhananjani,
there are other kinds of work, profitable and in accordance with the
Dhamma, by means of which one can refresh and nourish this body and
at the same time both avoid doing evil and practise merit."</P>
<P  >26.
Then the brahmin Dhananjani, having delighted and rejoiced in the
venerable Sariputta's words, rose from his seat and departed.</P>
<P  >27.
On a later occasion the brahmin Dhananjani became afflicted,
suffering, and gravely ill. Then he told a man: "Come, good man,
[192] go to the Blessed One, pay homage in my name with your head at
his feet, and say: 'Venerable sir, the brahmin Dhananjani is
afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill; he pays homage with his head
at the Blessed One's feet.' Then go to the venerable Sariputta,
pay homage in my name with your head at his feet, and say: 'Venerable
sir, the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill;
he pays homage with his head at the venerable Sariputta's feet.'
Then say thus: 'It would be good, venerable sir, if the venerable
Sariputta would come to the house of the brahmin Dhananjani, out of
compassion.'"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," the man replied, and he went to the Blessed One,
and after paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side
and delivered his message. Then he went to the venerable Sariputta
and after paying homage to the venerable Sariputta, he delivered his
message, saying: "It would be good, venerable sir, if the venerable
Sariputta would come to the residence of the brahmin Dhananjani, out
of compassion." The venerable Sariputta consented in silence.</P>
<P  >28.
Then the venerable Sariputta dressed, and taking his bowl and outer
robe, he went to the residence of the brahmin Dhananjani, sat down on
a seat made ready, and said to the brahmin Dhananjani: "I hope you
are getting well, brahmin, I hope you are comfortable. I hope your
painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that their
subsiding, not their increase, is apparent."</P>
<P  >29.
"Master Sariputta, I am not getting well, I am not comfortable. My
painful feelings are increasing, not subsiding; their increase and
not their subsiding is apparent. Just as if [193] a strong man were
splitting my head open with a sharp sword, so too, violent winds cut
through my head. I am not getting well … Just as if a strong man
were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband,
so too, there are violent pains in my head. I am not getting well …
Just as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an
ox's belly with a sharp butcher's knife, so too, violent winds
are carving up my belly. I am not getting well … Just as if two
strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over
a pit of hot coals, so too, there is a violent burning in my body. I
am not getting well, I am not comfortable. My painful feelings are
increasing, not subsiding; their increase and not their subsiding is
apparent."</P>
<P  >30.
"What do you think, Dhananjani? Which is better - hell or the
animal realm?" - "The animal realm, Master Sariputta." - "Which
is better - the animal realm or the realm of ghosts?" - "The
realm of ghosts, Master Sariputta." - "Which is better - the
realm of ghosts or the realm of human beings?" - "Human beings,
Master Sariputta." [194] "Which is better - human beings or the
gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings?" - "The gods of the
heaven of the Four Great Kings, Master Sariputta." - "Which is
better - the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings or the gods
of the heaven of the Thirty-three?" - "The gods of the heaven of
the Thirty-three, Master Sariputta." - "Which is better - the
gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three or the Yama gods?" - "The
Yama gods, Master Sariputta." - "Which is better - the Yama gods
or the gods of the Tusita heaven?" - "The gods of the Tusita
heaven, Master Sariputta." - "Which is better - the gods of the
Tusita heaven or the gods who delight in creating?" - "The gods
who delight in creating, Master Sariputta." - "Which is better -
the gods who delight in creating or the gods who wield power over
others' creations?" - "The gods who wield power over others'
creations, Master Sariputta."</P>
<P  >31.
"What do you think, Dhananjani? Which is better - the gods who
wield power over others' creations or the Brahmaworld?" - "Master
Sariputta said 'the Brahma-world.' Master Sariputta said 'the
Brahma-world.'"</P>
<P  >Then
the venerable Sariputta thought: "These brahmins are devoted to the
Brahma-world. Suppose I show the brahmin Dhananjani the path to the
company of Brahma?" [And he said:] "Dhananjani, I shall show you
the path to the company of Brahma. Listen and attend closely to what
I shall say." - "Yes, sir," he replied. [195] The venerable
Sariputta said this:</P>
<P  >32.
"What is the path to the company of Brahma? Here, Dhananjani, a
bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise
the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to
himself, he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind
imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility and without ill will. This is the path to the company of
Brahma.</P>
<P  >33-35.
"Again, Dhananjani, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a
mind imbued with compassion … with a mind imbued with appreciative
joy … with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second,
likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and
everywhere, and to all as to himself, he abides pervading the
all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity, abundant,
exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will. This
too is the path to the company of Brahma."</P>
<P  >36.
"Then, Master Sariputta, pay homage in my name with your head at
the Blessed One's feet, and say: 'Venerable sir, the brahmin
Dhananjani is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill; he pays homage
with his head at the Blessed One's feet.'"</P>
<P  >Then
the venerable Sariputta, having established the brahmin Dhananjani in
the inferior Brahma-world, rose from his seat and departed while
there was still more to be done.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote898anc" HREF="#sdendnote898sym"><SUP>dcccxcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Soon after the venerable Sariputta had left, the brahmin Dhananjani
died and reappeared in the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >37.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus,
Sariputta, having established the brahmin Dhananjani in the inferior
Brahma-world, rose from his seat and departed while there was still
more to be done."</P>
<P  >38.
Then the venerable Sariputta went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said: "Venerable
sir, the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill;
he pays homage with his head at the Blessed One's feet."</P>
<P  >"Sariputta,
having established the brahmin Dhananjani [196] in the inferior
Brahma-world, why did you rise from your seat and leave while there
was still more to be done?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, I thought thus: 'These Brahmins are devoted to the
Brahma-world. Suppose I show the brahmin Dhananjani the path to the
company of Brahma.'"</P>
<P  >"Sariputta,
the brahmin Dhananjani has died and has reappeared in the
Brahma-world."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote899anc" HREF="#sdendnote899sym"><SUP>dcccxcix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
