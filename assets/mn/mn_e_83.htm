<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote806anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote806sym"><SUP>dcccvi</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion, the Blessed One was living at Mithila in the
Makhadeva Mango Grove.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote807anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote807sym"><SUP>dcccvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Then in a certain place the Blessed One smiled. It occurred to the
venerable Ananda: "What is the reason, what is the cause, for the
Blessed One's smile? Tathagatas do not smile for no reason." So
he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands
in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, he asked him:
"Venerable sir, what is the reason, what is the cause, for the
Blessed One's smile? Tathagatas do not smile for no reason."</P>
<P  >3.
"Once, Ananda, in this same Mithila there was a king named
Makhadeva. He was a righteous king who ruled by the Dhamma, a great
king who was established in the Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote808anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote808sym"><SUP>dcccviii</SUP></A></SUP>
He conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders,
among town-dwellers and countryfolk, and he observed the Uposatha
days [75] on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote809anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote809sym"><SUP>dcccix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
"Now at the end of many years, many hundred years, many thousand
years, King Makhadeva addressed his barber thus: 'Good barber, when
you see any grey hairs growing on my head, then tell me.' - 'Yes,
sire,' he replied. And after many years, many hundred years, many
thousand years, the barber saw grey hairs growing on King Makhadeva's
head.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote810anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote810sym"><SUP>dcccx</SUP></A></SUP>
When he saw them, he said to the king: 'The divine messengers have
appeared, sire; grey hairs are to be seen growing on your majesty's
head.' - 'Then, good barber, pull out those grey hairs carefully
with tweezers and put them in my palm.' -'Yes, sire,' he
replied, and he pulled out those grey hairs carefully with tweezers
and put them in the king's palm.</P>
<P  >"Then
King Makhadeva gave the best township to his barber, and calling the
prince, his eldest son, he said: 'Dear prince, the divine
messengers have appeared;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote811anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote811sym"><SUP>dcccxi</SUP></A></SUP>
grey hairs are seen growing on my head. I have enjoyed human sensual
pleasures; now it is time to seek divine sensual pleasures. Come,
dear prince, take over the kingship. I shall shave off my hair and
beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into
homelessness. And now, dear prince, when you too see grey hairs
growing on your head, then after giving the best township to your
barber, and after carefully instructing the prince, your eldest son,
in kingship, shave off your hair and beard, put on the yellow robe,
and go forth from the home life into homelessness. Continue this good
practice instituted by me and do not be the last man. Dear prince,
when there are two men living, he under whom there occurs a breach of
this good practice - he is the last man among them. Therefore, dear
prince, I say to you: Continue this good practice [76] instituted by
me and do not be the last man.'</P>
<P  >5.
"Then, after giving the best township to his barber and after
carefully instructing the prince, his eldest son, in kingship, in the
Makhadeva Mango Grove he shaved off his hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness.</P>
<P  >"He
abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness,
likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so
above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he
abided pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility
and without ill will.</P>
<P  >"He
abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion ...
with a mind imbued with appreciative joy ... with a mind imbued with
equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the
fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to
himself, he abided pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind
imbued with equanimity, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility and without ill will.</P>
<P  >6.
"For eighty-four thousand years King Makhadeva played childish
games; for eighty-four thousand years he acted as viceregent; for
eighty-four thousand years he governed the kingdom;</P>
<P  >for
eighty-four thousand years he led the holy life in this Makhadeva
Mango Grove after shaving off his hair and beard, putting on the
yellow robe, and going forth from the home life into homelessness. By
developing the four divine abodes, on the dissolution of the body,
after death, he passed on to the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >7-9.
"Now at the end of many years, many hundred years, many thousand
years, King Makhadeva's son addressed his barber thus: ... (as
above, §§4-6, reading "King Makhadeva's son" throughout) ...
[77, 78] ... By developing the four divine abodes, on the dissolution
of the body, after death, he passed on to the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >10.
"The descendants of King Makhadeva's son to the number of
eighty-four thousand kings in succession, after shaving off their
hair and beard and putting on the yellow robe, went forth from the
home life into homelessness in this Makhadeva Mango Grove. They
abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness
... with compassion ... with appreciative joy ... with equanimity ...
without ill will.</P>
<P  >11.
"For eighty-four thousand years they played childish games; for
eighty-four thousand years they acted as viceregents; for eighty-four
thousand years they governed the kingdom; for eighty-four thousand
years they led the holy life in this Makhadeva Mango Grove after
shaving off their hair and beard, putting on the yellow robe, and
going forth from the home life into homelessness. By developing the
four divine abodes, on the dissolution of the body, after death, they
passed on to the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >12.
"Nimi was the last of those kings. He was a righteous king who
ruled by the Dhamma, a great king who was established in the Dhamma.
He conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders,
among town-dwellers and countryfolk, and he observed the Uposatha
days on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.</P>
<P  >13.
"Once, Ananda, when the gods of the Thirty-three [79] had met
together and were seated in the Sudhamma Assembly, this discussion
arose among them: 'It is a gain, sirs, for the people of Videha, it
is a great gain for the people of Videha that their King Nimi is a
righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, a great king who is
established in the Dhamma. He conducts himself by the Dhamma among
brahmins and householders, among towndwellers and countryfolk, and he
observes the Uposatha days on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth
of the fortnight.'</P>
<P  >"Then
Sakka, ruler of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirtythree: 'Good
sirs, do you want to see King Nimi?' - 'Good sir, we want to see
King Nimi.'</P>
<P  >"Now
on that occasion, it being the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, King
Nimi had washed his head and ascended to the upper palace chamber,
where he was seated for the Uposatha observance. Then, just as
quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his
extended arm, Sakka, ruler of gods, vanished among the gods of the
Thirty-three and appeared in the presence of King Nimi. He said: 'It
is a gain for you, great king, it is a great gain for you, great
king. When the gods of the Thirty-three had met together and were
seated in the Sudhamma Assembly, this discussion arose among them:
"It is a gain, sirs, for the people of Videha ... eighth of the
fortnight." Great king, the gods want to see you. I shall send a
chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds for you, great king.
Great king, mount the divine chariot without misgiving.'</P>
<P  >"King
Nimi consented in silence. Then, just as quickly as a strong man
might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, Sakka, ruler of
gods, vanished in the presence of King Nimi and appeared among the
gods of the Thirty-three.</P>
<P  >14.
"Then Sakka, ruler of gods, addressed the charioteer Matali thus:
'Come, good Matali, prepare a chariot harnessed to a thousand
thoroughbreds, and go to King Nimi and say: "Great king, this
chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds has been sent for you
by Sakka, ruler of gods. Great king, mount the divine [80] chariot
without misgiving.'"</P>
<P  >"'May
your words be held sacred,' the charioteer Matali replied. And
having prepared a chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds, he
went to King Nimi and said: 'Great king, this chariot harnessed to
a thousand thoroughbreds has been sent for you by Sakka, ruler of
gods. Great king, mount the divine chariot without misgiving. But,
great king, by which route shall I drive you: by that on which doers
of evil experience the results of evil actions, or by that on which
doers of good experience the results of good actions?' - 'Drive
me by both routes, Matali.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote812anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote812sym"><SUP>dcccxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
"Matali brought King Nimi to the Sudhamma Assembly. Sakka, ruler of
gods, saw King Nimi coming in the distance and said to him: 'Come,
great king! Welcome, great king! The gods of the Thirty-three, great
king, seated in the Sudhamma Assembly, have expressed themselves
thus: "It is a gain, sirs, for the people of Videha ... eighth of
the fortnight." Great king, the gods of the Thirty-three want to
see you. Great king, enjoy divine might among the gods.'</P>
<P  >"'Enough,
good sir. Let the charioteer drive me back to Mithila. There I will
conduct myself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders, among
town-dwellers and countryfolk; there I will observe the Uposatha days
on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.'</P>
<P  >16.
"Then Sakka, ruler of gods, told the charioteer Matali: 'Come,
good Matali, prepare the chariot harnessed to a thousand
thoroughbreds and drive King Nimi back to Mithila.'</P>
<P  >"'May
your word be held sacred,' the charioteer Matali replied. And
having prepared the chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds, he
drove King Nimi back to Mithila. And there, indeed, King Nimi
conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders,
among town-dwellers and countryfolk; and there [81] he observed the
Uposatha days on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the
fortnight.</P>
<P  >17-19.
"Then at the end of many years, many hundred years, many thousand
years, King Nimi addressed his barber thus: ... (as above, §§4-6,
reading "King Nimi" throughout) ... [82] ... By developing the
four divine abodes, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he
passed on to the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >20.
"Now King Nimi had a son named Kalarajanaka. He did not go forth
from the home life into homelessness. He broke that good practice. He
was the last man among them.</P>
<P  >21.
"Now, Ananda, it may be that you think thus: 'Certainly, someone
else was King Makhadeva on that occasion.' But it should not be
regarded thus. I was King Makhadeva on that occasion. I instituted
that good practice and later generations continued that good practice
instituted by me. But that kind of good practice does not lead to
disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct
knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana, but only to reappearance in
the Brahma-world. But there is this kind of good practice that has
been instituted by me now, which leads to complete disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana. And what is that good practice? It is this
Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, [83] right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration. This is the good practice
instituted by me now, which leads to complete disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana.</P>
<P  >"Ananda,
I say to you: continue this good practice instituted by me and do not
be the last man. Ananda, when there are two men living, he under whom
there occurs a breach of this good practice - he is the last man
among them. Therefore, Ananda, I say to you: continue this good
practice instituted by me and do not be the last man."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote813anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote813sym"><SUP>dcccxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
