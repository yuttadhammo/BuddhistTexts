108. Gopakamoggallana Sutta - With Gopaka Moggallana</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Ananda was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary, not long
after the Blessed One had attained to final Nibbana.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1031anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1031sym"><SUP>mxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha, being
suspicious of King Pajjota, was having Rajagaha fortified.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1032anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1032sym"><SUP>mxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Ananda dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, went into Rajagaha for alms. Then the
venerable Ananda thought: "It is still too early to wander for alms
in Rajagaha. Suppose I went to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana at his
workplace."</P>
<P  >4.
So the venerable Ananda went to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana at his
workplace. The brahmin Gopaka Moggallana saw the venerable Ananda
coming in the distance and said to him: "Let Master Ananda come!
Welcome to Master Ananda! It is long since Master Ananda found an
opportunity to come here. Let Master Ananda be seated; this seat is
ready." The venerable Ananda sat down on the seat made ready. [8]
The brahmin Gopaka Moggallana took a low seat, sat down at one side,
and asked the venerable Ananda:</P>
<P  >5.
"Master Ananda, is there any single bhikkhu who possesses in each
and every way all those qualities that were possessed by Master
Gotama, accomplished and fully enlightened?"</P>
<P  >"There
is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who possesses in each and every way
all those qualities that were possessed by the Blessed One,
accomplished and fully enlightened. For the Blessed One was the
arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of the unproduced path,
the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the knower of the path,
the finder of the path, the one skilled in the path. But his
disciples now abide following that path and become possessed of it
afterwards."</P>
<P  >6.
But this discussion between the venerable Ananda and the brahmin
Gopaka Moggallana was interrupted; for then the brahmin Vassakara,
the minister of Magadha,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1033anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1033sym"><SUP>mxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
while supervising the work at Rajagaha, went to the venerable Ananda
at the workplace of the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana. He exchanged
greetings with. the venerable Ananda, and when this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and asked the
venerable Ananda: "For what discussion are you sitting together
here now, Master Ananda? And what was your discussion that was
interrupted?"</P>
<P  >"Brahmin,
the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana asked me: 'Master Ananda, is there
any single bhikkhu who possesses in each and every way all those
qualities that were possessed by Master Gotama, accomplished and
fully enlightened?' I replied to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana:
'There is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who possesses in each and
every way all those qualities that were possessed by the Blessed One,
accomplished and fully enlightened. For the Blessed One was the
arouser of the unarisen path [9] ... But his disciples now abide
following that path and become possessed of it afterwards.' This
was our discussion that was interrupted when you arrived."</P>
<P  >7.
"Is there, Master Ananda, any single bhikkhu who was appointed by
Master Gotama thus: 'He will be your refuge when I am gone,' and
whom you now have recourse to?"</P>
<P  >"There
is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who was appointed by the Blessed One
who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, thus: 'He
will be your refuge when I am gone,' and whom we now have recourse
to."</P>
<P  >8.
"But is there, Master Ananda, any single bhikkhu who has been
chosen by the Sangha and appointed by a number of elder bhikkhus
thus: 'He will be our refuge after the Blessed One has gone,' and
whom you now have recourse to?"</P>
<P  >"There
is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who has been chosen by the Sangha and
appointed by a number of elder bhikkhus thus: 'He will be our
refuge after the Blessed One has gone,' and whom we now have
recourse to."</P>
<P  >9.
"But if you have no refuge, Master Ananda, what is the cause for
your concord?"</P>
<P  >"We
are not without a refuge, brahmin. We have a refuge; we have the
Dhamma as our refuge."</P>
<P  >10.
"But when you were asked: 'Is there, Master Ananda, any single
bhikkhu who was appointed by Master Gotama thus: "He will be your
refuge when I am gone," and whom you now have recourse to?' you
answered: 'There is no such single bhikkhu ... whom we now have
recourse to.' When you were asked: 'Is there, Master Ananda, any
single bhikkhu who has been chosen by the Sangha and appointed by a
number of elder bhikkhus thus: "He will be our refuge after the
Blessed One has gone," and whom you now have recourse to?' you
answered: 'There is no such single bhikkhu ... [10] ... whom we now
have recourse to.' When you were asked: 'But if you have no
refuge, Master Ananda, what is the cause for your concord?' you
answered: 'We are not without a refuge, brahmin. We have a refuge;
we have the Dhamma as our refuge.' Now how should the meaning of
these statements be regarded, Master Ananda?"</P>
<P  >"Brahmin,
the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully
enlightened, has prescribed the course of training for bhikkhus and
he has laid down the Patimokkha. On the Uposatha day as many of us as
live in dependence upon a single village district meet together in
unison, and when we meet we ask one who knows the Patimokkha to
recite it. If a bhikkhu remembers an offence or a transgression while
the Patimokkha is being recited, we deal with him according to the
Dhamma in the way we have been instructed. It is not the worthy ones
who deal with us; it is the Dhamma that deals with us."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1034anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1034sym"><SUP>mxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
"Is there, Master Ananda, any single bhikkhu whom you now honour,
respect, revere, and venerate, and on whom you live in dependence
honouring and respecting him?"</P>
<P  >"There
is a single bhikkhu, brahmin, whom we now honour, respect, revere,
and venerate, and on whom we live in dependence honouring and
respecting him."</P>
<P  >12.
"But when you were asked: 'Is there, Master Ananda, any single
bhikkhu who was appointed by Master Gotama ... ?' you answered
'There is no such single bhikkhu ... ' When you were asked: 'Is
there, Master Ananda, any single bhikkhu who has been chosen by the
Sangha ... ?' [11] you answered: 'There is no such single bhikkhu
... ' When you were asked: 'Is there, Master Ananda, any single
bhikkhu whom you honour, respect, revere,</P>
<P  >and
venerate, and on whom you live in dependence honouring and respecting
him?' you answered: 'There is such a single bhikkhu whom we now
honour ... and on whom we live in dependence honouring and respecting
him.' Now how should the meaning of these statements be regarded,
Master Ananda?"</P>
<P  >13.
"There are, brahmin, ten qualities inspiring confidence that have
been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and
fully enlightened. When these qualities are found in anyone among us,
we honour, respect, revere, and venerate him, and live in dependence
on him honouring and respecting him. What are the ten?</P>
<P  >14.
(1) "Here, brahmin, a bhikkhu is virtuous, he dwells restrained
with the restraint of the Patimokkha, he is perfect in conduct and
resort, and seeing fear in the slightest faults, he trains himself by
undertaking the training precepts.</P>
<P  >15.
(2) "He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and
consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as are good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right
meaning and phrasing, and which affirm a holy life that is utterly
perfect and pure - such teachings as these he has learned much of,
remembered, mastered verbally, investigated with the mind, and
penetrated well by view.</P>
<P  >16.
(3) "He is content with his robes, almsfood, resting place, and
medicinal requisites.</P>
<P  >17.
(4) "He obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four
jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding
here and now.</P>
<P  >18.
(5) "He wields the various kinds of supernormal power: having been
one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears
and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an
enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in
and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water
without sinking as though it were earth; [12] seated cross-legged, he
travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes
the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he wields bodily mastery
even as far as the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >19.
(6) "With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses
the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human,
those that are far as well as near.</P>
<P  >20.
(7) "He understands the minds of other beings, of other persons,
having encompassed them with his own mind. He understands a mind
affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as
unaffected by lust; he understands a mind affected by hate as
affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate;
he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion
and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; he
understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as
distracted; he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an
unexalted mind as unexalted; he understands a surpassed mind as
surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; he understands a
concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as
unconcentrated; he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an
unliberated mind as unliberated.</P>
<P  >21.
(8) "He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two
births ... (as Sutta 51, §24) ... Thus with their aspects and
particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >22.
(9) "With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the
human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and
superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he
understands how beings pass on according to their actions.</P>
<P  >23.
(10) "By realising for himself with direct knowledge, he here and
now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance
by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints.</P>
<P  >"These,
brahmin, are the ten qualities inspiring confidence that have been
declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and
fully enlightened. When these qualities are found in anyone among us,
we honour, respect, revere, and venerate him, and live in dependence
on him honouring and respecting him." [13]</P>
<P  >24.
When this was said, the brahmin Vassakara, the minister of Magadha,
said to General Upananda: "What do you think, general? When these
worthy ones honour one who should be honoured, respect one who should
be respected, revere one who should be revered, and venerate one who
should be venerated, surely they honour one who should be honoured ...
and venerate one who should be venerated. For if these worthy ones
did not honour, respect, revere, and venerate such. a person, then
whom</P>
<P  >could
they honour, respect, revere, and venerate, and on whom could they
live in dependence honouring and respecting?"</P>
<P  >25.
Then the brahmin Vassakara, the minister of Magadha, said to the
venerable Ananda: "Where is Master Ananda living now?"</P>
<P  >"Now
I am living in the Bamboo Grove, brahmin."</P>
<P  >"I
hope, Master Ananda, that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant, quiet and
undisturbed by voices, with an atmosphere of seclusion, remote from
people, favourable for retreat."</P>
<P  >"Indeed,
brahmin, that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant ... favourable for retreat
is because of such guardian protectors as yourself."</P>
<P  >"Indeed,
Master Ananda, that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant ... favourable for
retreat is because of the worthy ones who are meditators and
cultivate meditation. The worthy ones are meditators and cultivate
meditation. On one occasion, Master Ananda, Master Gotama was living
at Vesa]i in the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great Wood. Then I
went there and approached Master Gotama, and in many ways he gave a
talk about meditation. Master Gotama was a meditator and cultivated
meditation, and he praised every type of meditation."</P>
<P  >26.
"The Blessed One, brahmin, did not praise every type of meditation,
nor did he condemn every type of meditation. What kind [14] of
meditation did the Blessed One not praise? Here, brahmin, someone
abides with his mind obsessed by sensual lust, a prey to sensual
lust, and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from
arisen sensual lust. While he harbours sensual lust within, he
meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1035anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1035sym"><SUP>mxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
He abides with his mind obsessed by ill will, a prey to ill will ...
with his mind obsessed by sloth and torpor, a prey to sloth and
torpor ... with his mind obsessed by restlessness and remorse, a prey
to restlessness and remorse ... with his mind obsessed by doubt, a
prey to doubt, and he does not understand as it actually is the
escape from arisen doubt. While he harbours doubt within, he
meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates. The Blessed
One did not praise that kind of meditation.</P>
<P  >27.
"And what kind of meditation did the Blessed One praise? Here,
brahmin, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana ... With the stilling of applied and sustained</P>
<P  >thought,
he enters upon and abides in the second jhana ... With the fading
away as well of rapture ... he enters upon and abides in the third
jhana ... With the abandoning of pleasure and pain ... he enters upon
and abides in the fourth jhana ... The Blessed One praised that kind
of meditation."</P>
<P  >28.
"It seems, Master Ananda, that Master Gotama censured that kind of
meditation that should be censured and praised that kind of
meditation that should be praised. And now, Master Ananda, we depart.
We are busy and have much to do."</P>
<P  >"Now
is the time, brahmin, to do as you think fit." [15]</P>
<P  >Then
the brahmin Vassakara, the minister of Magadha, having delighted and
rejoiced in the venerable Ananda's words, rose from his seat and
departed.</P>
<P  >29.
Then, soon after he had left, the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana said to
the venerable Ananda: "Master Ananda has not yet answered what we
asked him."</P>
<P  >"Did
we not tell you, brahmin: 'There is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who
possesses in each and every way all those qualities that were
possessed by the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened. For
the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of
the unproduced path, the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the
knower of the path, the finder of the path, the one skilled in the
path. But his disciples now abide following that path and become
possessed of it afterwards'?"</P>
