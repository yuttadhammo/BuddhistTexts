59. Bahuvedaniya Sutta - The Many Kinds of Feeling</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the carpenter Pancakanga<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote615anc" HREF="#sdendnote615sym"><SUP>dcxv</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the venerable Udayin, and after paying homage to him, he sat
down at one side and asked him:</P>
<P  >3.
"Venerable sir, how many kinds of feeling have been stated by the
Blessed One?"</P>
<P  >"Three
kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One, householder:
pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neitherpainful-nor-pleasant
feeling. [397] These three kinds of feeling have been stated by the
Blessed One."</P>
<P  >"Not
three kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One, venerable
Udayin; two kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One:
pleasant feeling and painful feeling. This
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling has been stated by the Blessed
One as a peaceful and sublime kind of pleasure."</P>
<P  >A
second time and a third time the venerable Udayin stated his
position, and a second time and a third time the carpenter Pancakanga
stated his. But the venerable Udayin could not convince the carpenter
Pancakanga nor could the carpenter Pancakanga convince the venerable
Udayin.</P>
<P  >4.
The venerable Ananda heard their conversation. Then he went to the
Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side
and reported to the Blessed One the entire conversation between the
venerable Udayin and the carpenter Pancakanga. When he had finished,
the Blessed One told the venerable Ananda:</P>
<P  >5.
"Ananda, it was actually a true presentation that the carpenter
Pancakanga would not accept from Udayin, and it was actually a true
presentation that Udayin would not accept from the carpenter
Pancakanga. I have stated two kinds of feeling in one presentation;
[398] I have stated three kinds of feeling in another presentation; I
have stated five kinds of feeling in another presentation; I have
stated six kinds of feeling in another presentation; I have stated
eighteen kinds of feeling in another presentation; I have stated
thirty-six kinds of feeling in another presentation; I have stated
one hundred and eight kinds of feeling in another presentation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote616anc" HREF="#sdendnote616sym"><SUP>dcxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how the Dhamma has been shown by me in [different]
presentations.</P>
<P  >"When
the Dhamma has thus been shown by me in [different] presentations, it
may be expected of those who will not concede, allow, and accept what
is well stated and well spoken by others that they will take to
quarreling, brawling, and disputing, stabbing each other with verbal
daggers. But it may be expected of those who concede, allow, and
accept what is well stated and well spoken by others that they will
live in concord, with mutual appreciation, without disputing,
blending like milk and water, viewing each other with kindly eyes.</P>
<P  >6.
"Ananda, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure. What are
the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.
Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of
sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >7.
"Should anyone say: 'That is the utmost pleasure and joy that
beings experience,' I would not concede that to him. Why is that?
Because there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime
than that pleasure. And what is that other kind of pleasure? Here,
Ananda, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. This is that other kind of
pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >8.
"Should anyone say: 'That is the utmost pleasure and joy that
beings experience,' I would not concede that to him. [399]</P>
<P  >Why
is that? Because there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more
sublime than that pleasure. And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has
self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. This is
that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the
previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >9.
"Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu
abides in equanimity, mindful and fully aware, and still feeling
pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana,
on account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abiding
who has equanimity and is mindful.' This is that other kind of
pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >10.
"Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana, which has neitherpain-nor-pleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. This is that other kind of
pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote617anc" HREF="#sdendnote617sym"><SUP>dcxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
"Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form,
with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is
infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite
space. This is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime
than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >12.
"Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, by completely surmounting the base of infinite space,
aware that 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the base of infinite consciousness. This is that other kind
of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >13.
"Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the base of nothingness.</P>
<P  >This
is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the
previous pleasure. [400]</P>
<P  >14.
"Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This is that other kind of
pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >15.
"Should anyone say: 'That is the utmost pleasure and joy that
beings experience,' I would not concede that to him. Why is that?
Because there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime
than that pleasure. And what is that other kind of pleasure? Here,
Ananda, by completely surmounting the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is that other
kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >16.
"It is possible, Ananda, that wanderers of other sects might speak
thus: 'The recluse Gotama speaks of the cessation of perception and
feeling and he describes that as pleasure. What is this, and how is
this?' Wanderers of other sects who speak thus should be told:
'Friends, the Blessed One describes pleasure not only with
reference to pleasant feeling; rather, friends, the Tathagata
describes as pleasure any kind of pleasure wherever and in whatever
way it is found. '"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote618anc" HREF="#sdendnote618sym"><SUP>dcxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
