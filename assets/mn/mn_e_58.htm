58. Abhayarajakumara Sutta - To Prince Abhaya</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Prince Abhaya<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote611anc" HREF="#sdendnote611sym"><SUP>dcxi</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the Nigantha Nataputta, and after paying homage to him, sat
down at one side. Thereupon the Nigantha Nataputta said to him:</P>
<P  >3.
“Come, prince, refute the recluse Gotama’s doctrine, and a good
report of you will be spread to this effect: ‘Prince Abhaya has
refuted the doctrine of the recluse Gotama, who is so powerful and
mighty.’“</P>
<P  >“But
how, venerable sir, shall I refute his doctrine?”</P>
<P  >“Come,
prince, go to the recluse Gotama and say: ‘Venerable sir, would the
Tathagata utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to
others?’ If the recluse Gotama, on being asked thus, answers: ‘The
Tathagata, prince, would utter speech that would be unwelcome and
disagreeable to others,’ then say to him: ‘Then, venerable sir,
what is the difference between you and an ordinary person? For an
ordinary person also would utter speech that would be unwelcome and
disagreeable to others.’ But if the recluse Gotama, on being asked
thus, answers: ‘The Tathagata, prince, would not utter speech [393]
that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others,’ then say to
him: ‘Then, venerable sir, why have you declared of Devadatta:
“Devadatta is destined for the states of deprivation, Devadatta is
destined for hell, Devadatta will remain [in hell] for the aeon,
Devadatta is incorrigible”? Devadatta was angry and dissatisfied
with that speech of yours.’ When the recluse Gotama is posed this
two-horned question by you, he will not be able either to gulp it
down or to throw it up. If an iron spike were stuck in a man’s
throat, he would not be able either to gulp it down or to throw it
up; so too, prince, when the recluse Gotama is posed this two-homed
question by you, he will not be able either to gulp it down. or to
throw it up.”</P>
<P  >4.
“Yes, venerable sir,” Prince Abhaya replied. Then he rose from
his seat, and after paying homage to the Nigantha Nataputta, keeping
him on his right, he left and went to the Blessed One. After paying
homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side, looked at the
sun, and thought: “It is too late today to refute the Blessed One’s
doctrine. I shall refute the Blessed One’s doctrine in my own house
tomorrow.” Then he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, let
the Blessed One with three others consent to accept tomorrow’s meal
from me.” The Blessed One consented in silence.</P>
<P  >5.
Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, Prince Abhaya rose
from his seat, and after paying homage to him, keeping him on his
right, he departed. Then, when the night had ended, it being morning,
the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went
to Prince Abhaya’s house and sat down on the seat made ready. Then,
with his own hands, Prince Abhaya served and satisfied the Blessed
One with various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One had eaten
and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, Prince Abhaya took a low
seat, sat down at one side, and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >6.
“Venerable sir, would a Tathagata utter such speech as would be
unwelcome and disagreeable to others?”</P>
<P  >“There
is no one-sided answer to that, prince.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
venerable sir, the Niganthas have lost in this.”</P>
<P  >“Why
do you say this, prince: [394] ‘Then, venerable sir, the Niganthas
have lost in this’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote612anc" HREF="#sdendnote612sym"><SUP>dcxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Prince
Abhaya then reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with
the Nigantha Nataputta.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion a young tender infant was lying prone on Prince
Abhaya’s lap. Then the Blessed One said to Prince Abhaya: [395]
“What do you think, prince? If, while you or your nurse were not
attending to him, this child were to put a stick or a pebble in his
mouth, what would you do to him?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I would take it out. If I could not take it out at once, I would
take his head in my left hand, and crooking a finger of my right
hand, I would take it out even if it meant drawing blood. Why is
that? Because I have compassion for the child.”</P>
<P  >8.
“So too, prince, such speech as the Tathagata knows to be untrue,
incorrect, and unbeneficial, and which is also unwelcome and
disagreeable to others: such speech the Tathagata does not utter.
Such speech as the Tathagata knows to be true and correct but
unbeneficial, and which is also unwelcome and disagreeable to others:
such speech the Tathagata does not utter. Such speech as the
Tathagata knows to be true, correct, and beneficial, but which is
unwelcome and disagreeable to others: the Tathagata knows the time to
use such speech.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote613anc" HREF="#sdendnote613sym"><SUP>dcxiii</SUP></A></SUP>

speech the Tathagata does not utter. Such speech as the Tathagata

Such speech as the Tathagata knows to be true, correct, and
beneficial, and which is welcome and agreeable to others: the
Tathagata knows the time to use such speech. Why is that? Because the
Tathagata has compassion for beings.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Venerable sir, when learned nobles, learned brahmins, learned
householders, and learned recluses, after formulating a question,
then go to the Blessed One and pose it, has there already been in the
Blessed One’s mind the thought: ‘If they come to me and ask me
thus, I shall answer thus’? Or does that answer occur to the
Tathagata on the spot?”</P>
<P  >10.
“As to that, prince, I shall ask you a question in return. Answer
it as you choose. What do you think, prince? Are you skilled in the
parts of a chariot?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir, I am.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, prince? When people come to you and ask: ‘What is the
name of this part of the chariot?’ has there already been in your
mind the thought: [396] ‘If they come to me and ask me thus, I
shall answer them thus’? Or does that answer occur to you on the
spot?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I am well known as a charioteer skilled in the parts of a
chariot. All the parts of a chariot are well known to me. That answer
would occur to me on the spot.”</P>
<P  >11.
“So too, prince, when learned nobles, learned brahmins, learned
householders, and learned recluses, after formulating a question,
then come to the Tathagata and pose it, the answer occurs to the
Tathagata on the spot. Why is that? That element</P>
<P  >of
things has been fully penetrated by the Tathagata, through the full
penetration of which the answer occurs to the Tathagata on the
spot.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote614anc" HREF="#sdendnote614sym"><SUP>dcxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
When this was said, Prince Abhaya said: “Magnificent, venerable
sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! The Blessed One has made the Dhamma
clear in many ways … From today let the Blessed One remember me as
a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.”</P>
