82. Ratthapala Sutta - On Ratthapala</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Kuru country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually he
arrived at a Kuru town named Thullakotthita.</P>
<P  >2.
The brahmin householders of Thullakotthita heard: “The recluse
Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has
been wandering in the Kuru country [55] with a large Sangha of
bhikkhus and has come to Thullakotthita. Now a good report of Master
Gotama has been spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He
declares this world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this
generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its
people, which he has himself realised with direct knowledge. He
teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning, good in the middle, and
good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals
a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure.’ Now it is good to
see such arahants.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then the brahmin householders of Thullakotthita went to the Blessed
One. Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side;
some exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their
hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down
at one side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One’s
presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at
one side. When they were seated, the Blessed One instructed, urged,
roused, and encouraged them with talk on the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >4.
Now at that time a clansman named Ratthapala, the son of the leading
clan in that same Thullakotthita, was sitting in the assembly. Then
it occurred to him: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the
Blessed One, it is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy
life, utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave
off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the
home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then the brahmin householders of Thullakotthita, having been
instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by the Blessed One with
talk on the Dhamma, delighted and rejoiced in his words. They then
rose from their [56] seats, and after paying homage to him, they
departed, keeping him on their right.</P>
<P  >6.
Soon after they had gone, the clansman Ratthapala went to the Blessed
One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said
to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, as I understand the Dhamma
taught by the Blessed One, it is not easy while living in a home to
lead the holy life, utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.
Venerable sir, I wish to shave off my hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness. I
would receive the going forth under the Blessed One, I would receive
the full admission.”</P>
<P  >“Have
you been permitted by your parents, Ratthapala, to go forth from the
home life into homelessness?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir, I have not been permitted by my parents.”</P>
<P  >“Ratthapala,
Tathagatas do not give the going forth to anyone who does not have
his parents’ permission.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I shall see to it that my parents permit me to go forth from the
home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >7.
Then the clansman Ratthapala rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to the Blessed One, he departed, keeping him on his right. He
went to his parents and told them: “Mother and father, as I
understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is not easy while
living in a home to lead the holy life, utterly perfect and pure as a
polished shell. I wish to shave off my hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness. Give
me permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >When
he had said this, his parents replied: “Dear Ratthapala, you are
our only son, dear and beloved. You have been raised in comfort,
brought up in comfort; you know nothing of suffering, dear
Ratthapala. [57] Even in case of your death we would lose you
unwillingly, so how could we give you our permission to go forth from
the home life into homelessness while you are still living?”</P>
<P  >For
the second time … For the third time the clansman Ratthapala said
to his parents: “Mother and father … give me permission to go
forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >For
the third time his parents replied: “Dear Ratthapala … how could
we give you our permission to go forth from the home life into
homelessness while you are still living?”</P>
<P  >Then,
not receiving his parents’ permission to go forth, the clansman
Ratthapala lay down there on the bare floor, saying:</P>
<P  >“Right
here I shall either die or receive the going forth.” [58]</P>
<P  >8.
Then the clansman Ratthapala’s parents said to him: “Dear
Ratthapala, you are our only son, dear and beloved. You have been
raised in comfort, brought up in comfort; you know nothing of
suffering, dear Ratthapala. Get up, dear Ratthapala, eat, drink, and
amuse yourself. While eating, drinking, and amusing yourself, you can
be happy enjoying sensual pleasures and making merit. We do not
permit you to go forth from the home life into homelessness. Even in
the case of your death we would lose you unwillingly, so how could we
give you our permission to go forth from the home life into
homelessness while you are still living?” When this was said, the
clansman Ratthapala was silent.</P>
<P  >For
the second time … For the third time his parents said to him: “Dear
Ratthapala … how could we give you our permission to go forth from
the home life into homelessness while you are still living?” For
the third time the clansman Ratthapala was silent.</P>
<P  >9.
Then the clansman Ratthapala’s parents went to his friends and said
to them: “Dears, the clansman Ratthapala has lain down on the bare
floor, having said: ‘Right here I shall either die or receive the
going forth.’ Come, dears, go to the clansman Ratthapala and say to
him: ‘Friend Ratthapala, you are your parents’ only son … Get
up, friend Ratthapala, eat, drink, and amuse yourself … [59] how
could your parents give you their permission to go forth from the
home life into homelessness while you are still living?’“</P>
<P  >10.
Then the clansman Ratthapala’s friends went to him and said:
“Friend Ratthapala, you are your parents’ only son, dear and
beloved. You have been raised in comfort, brought up in comfort; you
know nothing of suffering, friend Ratthapala. Get up, friend
Ratthapala, eat, drink, and amuse yourself. While eating, drinking,
and amusing yourself, you can be happy enjoying sensual pleasures and
making merit. Your parents do not permit you to go forth from the
home life into homelessness. Even in case of your death they would
lose you unwillingly, so how could they give you their permission to
go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still
living?” When this was said, the clansman Ratthapala was silent.</P>
<P  >For
the second time … For the third time his friends said to him:
“Friend Ratthapala … how could they give you their permission to
go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still
living?” For the third time the clansman Ratthapala was silent.</P>
<P  >11.
Then the clansman Ratthapala’s friends went to his parents and said
to them: “Mother and father, the clansman Ratthapala is lying down
there on the bare floor, having said: ‘Right here I shall either
die or [60] get the going forth.’ Now if you do not give him your
permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness, he will
die there. But if you give him your permission, you will see him
after he has gone forth. And if he does not enjoy the going forth,
what else can he do then but return here? So give him your permission
to go forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
dears, we give the clansman Ratthapala permission to go forth from
thehome life into homelessness. But when he has gone forth, he must
visit his parents.”</P>
<P  >Then
the clansman Ratthapala’s friends went to him and told him: “Get
up, friend Ratthapala. Your parents permit you to go forth from the
home life into homelessness. But when you have gone forth, you must
visit your parents.”</P>
<P  >12.
The clansman Ratthapala then got up, and when he had regained his
strength, he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him,
he sat down at one side and told him: “Venerable sir, I have my
parents’ permission to go forth from the home life into
homelessness. Let the Blessed One give me the going forth.” Then
the clansman Ratthapala received the going forth under the Blessed
One, and he received the full admission.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote796anc" HREF="#sdendnote796sym"><SUP>dccxcvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
Then not long after the venerable Ratthapala had received the full
admission, a half-month after he had received the full</P>
<P  >admission,
the Blessed One, having stayed at Thullakotthita as long as he chose,
set out to wander towards Savatthi. Wandering by stages, he
eventually arrived at Savatthi, and there [61] he lived at Savatthi
in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >14.
Before long, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and
resolute, the venerable Ratthapala, by realising for himself with
direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that
supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly
go forth from the home life into homelessness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote797anc" HREF="#sdendnote797sym"><SUP>dccxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
He directly knew: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being.” And the venerable Ratthapala became one of the
arahants.</P>
<P  >15.
Then the venerable Ratthapala went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told him:
“Venerable sir, I wish to visit my parents, if I have the Blessed
One’s permission.”</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One penetrated mentally the thoughts in venerable
Ratthapala’s mind. When he knew that the clansman Ratthapala was
incapable of abandoning the training and returning to the low life,
he told him: “Now is the time, Ratthapala, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >16.
Then the venerable Ratthapala rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to the Blessed One, he departed, keeping him on his right. He
then set his resting place in order, and taking his bowl and outer
robe, set out to wander towards Thullakotthita. Wandering by stages,
he eventually arrived at Thullakotthita. There he lived in
Thullakotthita in King Koravya’s Migacira Garden. Then, when it was
morning, he dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into
Thullakotthita for alms. As he was wandering for alms from house to
house in Thullakotthita, he came to his own father’s house.</P>
<P  >17.
Now on that occasion the venerable Ratthapala’s father was sitting
in the hall of the central door having his hair dressed. When he saw
the venerable Ratthapala coming in the distance, he said: “Our only
son, dear and beloved, was made to go forth by these bald-pated
recluses.” [62] Then at his own father’s house the venerable
Ratthapala received neither alms nor a polite refusal; instead, he
received only abuse.</P>
<P  >18.
Just then a slavewoman belonging to one of his relatives was about to
throw away some old porridge.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote798anc" HREF="#sdendnote798sym"><SUP>dccxcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Seeing this, the venerable Ratthapala said to her: “Sister, if that
stuff is to be thrown away, then pour it into my bowl here.”</P>
<P  >While
she was doing so, she recognised the characteristic features of his
hands, his feet, and his voice. Then she went to his mother and said:
“Please know, my lady, that my lord’s son Ratthapala has
arrived.”</P>
<P  >“Gracious!
If what you say is true, you are no longer a slave!”</P>
<P  >Then
the venerable Ratthapala’s mother went to his father and said:
“Please know, householder, they say that the clansman Ratthapala
has arrived.”</P>
<P  >19.
Just then the venerable Ratthapala was eating the old porridge by the
wall of a certain shelter. His father went to him and said:
“Ratthapala, my dear, surely there is … and you will be eating
old porridge!<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote799anc" HREF="#sdendnote799sym"><SUP>dccxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
Is there not your own house to go to?”</P>
<P  >“How
could we have a house, householder, when we have gone forth from the
home life into homelessness? We are homeless, householder. We went
[63] to your house, but we received neither alms nor a polite refusal
there; instead we received only abuse.”</P>
<P  >“Come,
dear Ratthapala, let us go to the house.”</P>
<P  >“Enough,
householder, my meal for today is finished.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
dear Ratthapala, consent to accept tomorrow’s meal.” The
venerable Ratthapala consented in silence.</P>
<P  >20.
Then, knowing that the venerable Ratthapala had consented, his father
went back to his own house where he had gold coins and bullion made
into a large heap and covered it with mats. Then he told the
venerable Ratthapala’s former wives: “Come, daughters-in-law,
adorn yourselves with ornaments in the way Ratthapala found you most
dear and loveable.”</P>
<P  >21.
When night had ended, the venerable Ratthapala’s father had good
food of various kinds prepared in his own house and had the time
announced to the venerable Ratthapala: “It is time, dear
Ratthapala, the meal is ready.”</P>
<P  >22.
Then, it being morning, the venerable Ratthapala dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, he went to his own father’s house and sat
down on the seat made ready. Then his father had the pile of gold
coins and bullion uncovered and said: “Dear Ratthapala, this is
your maternal fortune; your paternal fortune is another and your
ancestral fortune is yet another. Dear Ratthapala, you can enjoy the
wealth and make merit. Come then, dear, [64] abandon the training and
return to the low life, enjoy the wealth and make merit.”</P>
<P  >“Householder,
if you would follow my advice, then have this pile of gold coins and
bullion loaded on carts and carried away to be dumped midstream in
the river Ganges. Why is that? Because, householder, on account of
this there will arise for you sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair.”</P>
<P  >23.
Then the venerable Ratthapala’s former wives clasped his feet and
said to him: “What are they like, my lord’s son, the nymphs for
whose sake you lead the holy life?”</P>
<P  >“We
do not lead the holy life for the sake of nymphs, sisters.”</P>
<P  >“Our
lord’s son Ratthapala calls us ‘sisters,’“they cried and
right there they fainted.</P>
<P  >24.
Then the venerable Ratthapala told his father: “Householder, if
there is a meal to be given, then give it. Do not harass us.”</P>
<P  >“Eat
then, dear Ratthapala, the meal is ready.”</P>
<P  >Then,
with his own hands, the venerable Ratthapala’s father served and
satisfied him with the various kinds of good food. When the venerable
Ratthapala had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, he
stood up and uttered these stanzas:</P>
<P  >25.
“Behold a puppet here pranked out<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote800anc" HREF="#sdendnote800sym"><SUP>dccc</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
A body built up out of sores,</P>
<P >
Sick, an object for concern,</P>
<P >
Where no stability abides.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Behold a figure here pranked out</P>
<P >
With jewellery and earrings too,</P>
<P >
A skeleton wrapped up in skin,</P>
<P >
Made attractive by its clothes.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Its feet adorned with henna dye</P>
<P >
And powder smeared upon its face:</P>
<P >
It may beguile a fool, but not</P>
<P >
A seeker of the further shore. [65]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Its hair is dressed in eightfold plaits</P>
<P >
And unguent smeared upon its eyes:</P>
<P >
It may beguile a fool, but not</P>
<P >
A seeker of the further shore.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
A filthy body well adorned</P>
<P >
Like a new-painted unguent pot:</P>
<P >
It may beguile a fool, but not</P>
<P >
A seeker of the further shore.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
The deer-hunter set out the snare</P>
<P >
But the deer did not spring the trap;</P>
<P >
We ate the bait and now depart</P>
<P >
Leaving the hunters to lament.”</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >26.
After the venerable Ratthapala had stood up and uttered these
stanzas, he went to King Koravya’s Migacira garden and sat down at
the root of a tree for the day’s abiding.</P>
<P  >27.
Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper thus: “Good gamekeeper,
tidy up the Migacira Garden so that we may go to the pleasure garden
to see a pleasing spot.” - “Yes, sire,” he replied. Now while
he was tidying up the Migacira Garden, the gamekeeper saw the
venerable Ratthapala seated at the root of a tree for the day’s
abiding. When he saw him, he went to King Koravya and told him:
“Sire, the Migacira Garden has been tidied up. The clansman
Ratthapala is there, the son of the leading clan in this same
Thullakotthita, of whom you have always spoken highly;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote801anc" HREF="#sdendnote801sym"><SUP>dccci</SUP></A></SUP>
he is seated at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
good Migava, enough of the pleasure garden for today. Now we shall go
to pay respects to that Master Ratthapala.”</P>
<P  >28.
Then, saying: “Give away all the food that has been prepared
there,” King Koravya had a number of state carriages prepared, and
mounting one of them, accompanied by the other carriages, he drove
out from Thullakotthita with the full pomp of royalty to see the
venerable Ratthapala. He drove thus as far as the road was passable
for carriages, and then he dismounted from his carriage and went
forward on foot with a following of the most eminent officials to
where the venerable Ratthapala was. [66] He exchanged greetings with
the venerable Ratthapala, and when this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he stood at one side and said: “Here is an elephant
rug. Let Master Ratthapala be seated on it.”</P>
<P  >“There
is no need, great king. Sit down. I am sitting on my own mat.”</P>
<P  >King
Koravya sat down on a seat made ready and said:</P>
<P  >29.
“Master Ratthapala, there are four kinds of loss. Because they have
undergone these four kinds of loss, some people here shave off their
hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home
life into homelessness. What are the four? They are loss through
ageing, loss through sickness, loss of wealth, and loss of relatives.</P>
<P  >30.
“And what is loss through ageing? Here, Master Ratthapala, someone
is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last
stage. He considers thus: ‘I am old, aged, burdened with years,
advanced in life, come to the last stage. It is no longer easy for me
to acquire unacquired wealth or to augment wealth already acquired.
Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go
forth from the home life into homelessness.’ Because he has
undergone that loss through ageing, he shaves off his hair and beard,
puts on the yellow robe, and goes forth from the home life into
homelessness. This is called loss through ageing. But Master
Ratthapala is now still young, a black-haired young man endowed with
the blessing of youth, in the prime of life. Master Ratthapala has
not undergone any loss through ageing. What has he known or seen or
heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness?</P>
<P  >31.
“And what is loss through sickness? Here, Master Ratthapala,
someone is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill. He considers thus:
‘I am afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill. It is no longer easy
for me to acquire unacquired wealth … [67] … into homelessness.’
Because he has undergone that loss through sickness.. .he goes forth
from the home life into homelessness. This is called loss through
sickness. But Master Ratthapala now is free from illness and
affliction; he possesses a good digestion that is neither too cool
nor too warm but medium. Master Ratthapala has not undergone any loss
through sickness. What has he known or seen or heard that he has gone
forth from the home life into homelessness?</P>
<P  >32.
“And what is loss of wealth? Here, Master Ratthapala, someone is
rich, of great wealth, of great possessions. Gradually his wealth
dwindles away. He considers thus: ‘Formerly I was rich, of great
wealth, of great possessions. Gradually my wealth has dwindled away.
It is no longer easy for me to</P>
<P  >acquire
unacquired wealth … into homelessness.’ Because he has undergone
that loss of wealth … he goes forth from the home life into
homelessness. This is called loss of wealth. But Master Ratthapala is
the son of the leading clan in this same Thullakotthita. Master
Ratthapala has not undergone any loss of wealth. What has he known or
seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into
homelessness?</P>
<P  >33.
“And what is loss of relatives? Here, Master Ratthapala, someone
has many friends and companions, kinsmen and relatives. Gradually
those relatives of his dwindle away. He considers thus: ‘Formerly I
had many friends and companions, kinsmen and relatives. Gradually
those relatives of mine have dwindled away. It is no longer easy for
me to acquire unacquired wealth … [68] … into homelessness.’
Because he has undergone that loss of relatives … he goes forth
from the home life into homelessness. This is called loss of
relatives. But Master Ratthapala has many friends and companions,
kinsmen and relatives, in this same Thullakotthita. Master Ratthapala
has not undergone any loss of relatives. What has he known or seen or
heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness?</P>
<P  >34.
“Master Ratthapala, these are the four kinds of loss. Because they
have undergone these four kinds of loss, some people here shave off
their hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the
home life into homelessness. Master Ratthapala has not undergone any
of these. What has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth
from the home life into homelessness?”</P>
<P  >35.
“Great king, there are four summaries of the Dhamma that have been
taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully
enlightened. Knowing and seeing and hearing them, I went forth from
the home life into homelessness. What are the four?</P>
<P  >36.
(1) “‘[Life in] any world is unstable, it is swept away’:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote802anc" HREF="#sdendnote802sym"><SUP>dcccii</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the first summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who
knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened. Knowing and
seeing and hearing this, I went forth from the home life into
homelessness.</P>
<P  >(2)
“‘[Life in] any world has no shelter and no protector’:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote803anc" HREF="#sdendnote803sym"><SUP>dccciii</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the second summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One
who knows and sees …</P>
<P  >(3)
“‘[Life in] any world has nothing of its own; one has to leave
all and pass on’:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote804anc" HREF="#sdendnote804sym"><SUP>dccciv</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the third summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who
knows and sees …</P>
<P  >(4)
“‘[Life in] any world is incomplete, insatiate, the slave of
craving’:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote805anc" HREF="#sdendnote805sym"><SUP>dcccv</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the fourth summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One
who knows and sees …</P>
<P  >37.
“Great king, these are the four summaries of the Dhamma that have
been taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and
fully enlightened. [69] Knowing and seeing and hearing them, I went
forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >38.
“Master Ratthapala said: ‘[Life in] any world is unstable, it is
swept away.’ How should the meaning of that statement be
understood?”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? When you were twenty or twenty-five years
old, were you an expert rider of elephants, an expert horseman, an
expert charioteer, an expert archer, an expert swordsman, strong in
thighs and arms, sturdy, capable in battle?”</P>
<P  >“When
I was twenty or twenty-five years old, Master Ratthapala, I was an
expert rider of elephants … strong in thighs and arms, sturdy,
capable in battle. Sometimes I wonder if I had supernormal power
then. I do not see anyone who could equal me in strength.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Are you now as strong in thighs and arms,
as sturdy and as capable in battle?”</P>
<P  >“No,
Master Ratthapala. Now I am old, aged, burdened with years, advanced
in life, come to the last stage; my years have turned eighty.
Sometimes I mean to put my foot here and I put my foot somewhere
else.”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: ‘[Life in] any
world is unstable, it is swept away’; and when I knew and saw and
heard this, I went forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >“It
is wonderful, Master Ratthapala, it is marvellous how well that has
been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished
and fully enlightened: ‘[Life in] any world is unstable, it is
swept away.’ It is indeed so!</P>
<P  >39.
“Master Ratthapala, there exist in this court elephant troops and
cavalry and chariot troops and infantry, which will serve to subdue
any threats to us. [70] Now Master Ratthapala said: ‘[Life in] any
world has no shelter and no protector.’ How should the meaning of
that statement be understood?”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Do you have any chronic ailment?”</P>
<P  >“I
have a chronic wind ailment, Master Ratthapala. Sometimes my friends
and companions, kinsmen, and relatives, stand around me, thinking:
‘Now King Koravya is about to die, now King Koravya is about to
die!’“</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Can you command your friends and
companions, your kinsmen and relatives: ‘Come, my good friends and
companions, my kinsmen and relatives. All of you present share this
painful feeling so that I may feel less pain’? Or do you have to
feel that pain yourself alone?”</P>
<P  >“I
cannot command my friends and companions, my kinsmen and relatives
thus, Master Ratthapala. I have to feel that pain alone.”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: ‘[Life in] any
world has no shelter and no protector’; and when I knew and saw and
heard this, I went forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >“It
is wonderful, Master Ratthapala, it is marvellous how well that has
been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished
and fully enlightened: ‘[Life in] any world has no shelter and no
protector.’ It is indeed so!</P>
<P  >40.
“Master Ratthapala, there exist in this court abundant gold coins
and bullion stored away in vaults and depositories. Now Master
Ratthapala said: ‘[Life in] any world has nothing of its own; one
has to leave all and pass on.’ How should the meaning of that
statement be understood?”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? You now [71] enjoy yourself provided and
endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure, but will you be able
to have it of the life to come: ‘Let me likewise enjoy myself
provided and endowed with these same five cords of sensual pleasure’?
Or will others take over this property, while you will have to pass
on according to your actions?”</P>
<P  >“I
cannot have it thus of the life to come, Master Ratthapala. On the
contrary, others will take over this property while I shall have to
pass on according to my actions.”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: ‘[Life in] any
world has nothing of its own; one has to leave all and pass on’;
and when I knew and saw and heard this, I went forth from the home
life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >“It
is wonderful, Master Ratthapala, it is marvellous how well that has
been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished
and fully enlightened: ‘[Life in] any world has nothing of its own;
one has to leave all and pass on.’ It is indeed so!</P>
<P  >41.
“Now Master Ratthapala said: ‘[Life in] any world is incomplete,
insatiate, the slave of craving.’ How should the meaning of that
statement be understood?”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Do you reign over the rich Kuru country?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
Master Ratthapala, I do.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man came
to you from the east and said: ‘Please know, great king, that I
have come from the east, and there I saw a large country, powerful
and rich, very populous and crowded with people. There are plenty of
elephant troops there, plenty of cavalry, chariot troops and
infantry; there is plenty of ivory there, and plenty of gold coins
and bullion both unworked and worked, and plenty of women for wives.
With your present forces you can conquer it. Conquer it then, great
king.’ What would you do?” [72]</P>
<P  >“We
would conquer it and reign over it, Master Ratthapala.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man came
to you from the west … from the north … from the south and said:
‘Please know, great king, that I have come from the south, and
there I saw a large country, powerful and rich … Conquer it then,
great king.’ What would you do?”</P>
<P  >“We
would conquer it too and reign over it, Master Ratthapala.”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: ‘[Life in] any
world is incomplete, insatiate, the slave of craving’; and when I
knew and saw and heard this, I went forth from the home life into
homelessness.”</P>
<P  >“It
is wonderful, Master Ratthapala, it is marvellous how well that has
been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and</P>
<P  >sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened: ‘[Life in] any world is
incomplete, insatiate, the slave of craving.’ It is indeed so!”</P>
<P  >42.
That is what the venerable Ratthapala said. And having said that he
said further:</P>
<P >
“I see men wealthy in the world, who yet</P>
<P >
From ignorance give not their gathered wealth.</P>
<P >
Greedily they hoard away their riches</P>
<P >
Longing still for further sensual pleasures.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
A king who has conquered the earth by force</P>
<P >
And rules over the land the ocean bounds</P>
<P >
Is yet unsated with the sea’s near shore</P>
<P >
And hungers for its further shore as well. [73]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Most other people too, not just a king,</P>
<P >
Encounter death with craving unabated;</P>
<P >
[With plans] still incomplete they leave the corpse;</P>
<P >
Desires remain unsated in the world.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
His relatives lament and rend their hair,</P>
<P >
Crying, ‘Ah me! Alas! Our love is dead!’</P>
<P >
They bear away the body wrapped in shrouds</P>
<P >
To place it on a pyre and burn it there.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Clad in a shroud, he leaves his wealth behind,</P>
<P >
Prodded with stakes he burns [upon the pyre].</P>
<P >
And as he dies, no relatives or friends</P>
<P >
Can offer him shelter and refuge here.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
While his heirs take over his wealth, this being</P>
<P >
Must pass on according to his actions;</P>
<P >
And as he dies nothing can follow him;</P>
<P >
Not child nor wife nor wealth nor royal estate.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Longevity is not acquired with wealth</P>
<P >
Nor can prosperity banish old age;</P>
<P >
Short is this life, as all the sages say,</P>
<P >
Eternity it knows not, only change.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
The rich and poor alike shall feel [Death’s] touch,</P>
<P >
The fool and sage as well shall feel it too;</P>
<P >
But while the fool lies stricken by his folly,</P>
<P >
No sage will ever tremble at the touch.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Better is wisdom here than any wealth,</P>
<P >
Since by wisdom one gains the final goal.</P>
<P >
For people through ignorance do evil deeds</P>
<P >
While failing to reach the goal from life to life.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
As one goes to the womb and the next world,</P>
<P >
Renewing the successive round of births,</P>
<P >
Another of little wisdom, trusting him,</P>
<P >
Goes also to the womb and the next world. [74]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Just as a robber caught in burglary</P>
<P >
Is made to suffer for his evil deed,</P>
<P >
So people after death, in the next world,</P>
<P >
Are made to suffer for their evil deeds.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Sensual pleasures, varied, sweet, delightful,</P>
<P >
In many different ways disturb the mind:</P>
<P >
Seeing the danger in these sensual ties</P>
<P >
I chose to lead the homeless life, O King.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
As fruits fall from the tree, so people too,</P>
<P >
Both young and old, fall when this body breaks.</P>
<P >
Seeing this too, O King, I have gone forth:</P>
<P >
Better is the recluse’s life assured.”</P>
