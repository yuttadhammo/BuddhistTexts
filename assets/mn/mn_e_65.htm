65. Bhaddali Sutta - To Bhaddali</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I eat at a single session. By so doing, I am free from
illness and affliction, and I enjoy health, strength, and a
comfortable abiding.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote660anc" HREF="#sdendnote660sym"><SUP>dclx</SUP></A></SUP>
Come, bhikkhus, eat at a single session. By so doing, you too will be
free from illness and affliction, and you will enjoy health,
strength, and a comfortable abiding.”</P>
<P  >3.
When this was said, the venerable Bhaddali told the Blessed One:
“Venerable sir, I am not willing to eat at a single session; for if
I were to do so, I might have worry and anxiety about it.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote661anc" HREF="#sdendnote661sym"><SUP>dclxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Then,
Bhaddali, eat one part there where you are invited and bring away one
part to eat. By eating in that way, [438] you will maintain
yourself.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I am not willing to eat in that way either; for if I were to do
so, I might also have worry and anxiety about it.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote662anc" HREF="#sdendnote662sym"><SUP>dclxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
Then, when this training precept was being made known by the Blessed
One,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote663anc" HREF="#sdendnote663sym"><SUP>dclxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
the venerable Bhaddali publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus
his unwillingness to undertake the training. Then the venerable
Bhaddali did not present himself to the Blessed One for the whole of
that three-month period [of the Rains], as he did riot fulfil the
training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.</P>
<P  >5.
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were engaged in making up a
robe for the Blessed One, thinking: “With his robe completed, at
the end of the three months [of the Rains], the Blessed One will set
out wandering.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then the venerable Bhaddali went to those bhikkhus and exchanged
greetings with them, and when this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side. When he had done so, they said to
him: “Friend Bhaddali, this robe is being made up for the Blessed
One. With his robe completed, at the end of the three months [of the
Rains], the Blessed One will set out wandering. Please, friend
Bhaddali, give proper attention to your declaration. Do not let it
become more difficult for you later on.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Yes, friends,” he replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and
after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said:
“Venerable sir, a transgression overcame me, in that like a fool,
confused and blundering, when a training precept was being made known
by the Blessed One, I publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus my
unwillingness to undertake the training. Venerable sir, may the
Blessed One forgive my transgression seen as such for the sake of
restraint in the future.”</P>
<P  >8.
“Surely, Bhaddali, a transgression overcame you, in that like a
fool, confused and blundering, when a training precept was being made
known by me, you publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus your
unwillingness to undertake the training.</P>
<P  >9.
“Bhaddali, this circumstance was not recognised by you: ‘The
Blessed One is living at Savatthi, and the Blessed One will know me
thus: “The bhikkhu named Bhaddali is one who does not fulfil the
training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.’“This circumstance was
not recognised by you.</P>
<P  >“Also,
this circumstance was not recognised by you: ‘Many [439] bhikkhus
have taken up residence at Savatthi for the Rains, and they too will
know me thus: “The bhikkhu named Bhaddali is one who does not
fulfil the training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.’“This
circumstance too was not recognised by you.</P>
<P  >“Also,
this circumstance was not recognised by you: ‘Many bhikkhunis have
taken up residence at Savatthi for the Rains, and they too will know
me thus: “The bhikkhu named Bhaddali is one who does not fulfil the
training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.’“This circumstance too
was not recognised by you.</P>
<P  >“Also,
this circumstance was not recognised by you: ‘Many men lay
followers … Many women lay followers are staying at Savatthi, and
they too will know me thus: “The bhikkhu named Bhaddali is one who
does not fulfil the training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.’“This
circumstance too was not recognised by you.</P>
<P  >“Also,
this circumstance was not recognised by you: ‘Many recluses and
brahmins of other sects have taken up residence at Savatthi for the
Rains, and they too will know me thus: “The bhikkhu named Bhaddali,
an elder disciple of the recluse Gotama, is one who does not fulfil
the training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.’“This circumstance
too was not recognised by you.”</P>
<P  >10.
“Venerable sir, a transgression overcame me, in that like a fool,
confused and blundering, when a training precept was being made known
by the Blessed One, I publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus my
unwillingness to undertake the training. Venerable sir, may the
Blessed One forgive my transgression seen as such for the sake of
restraint in the future.”</P>
<P  >“Surely,
Bhaddali, a transgression overcame you, in that like a fool, confused
and blundering, when a training precept was being made known by me,
you publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus your unwillingness to
undertake the training.</P>
<P  >11.
“What do you think, Bhaddali? Suppose a bhikkhu here were one
liberated-in-both-ways,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote664anc" HREF="#sdendnote664sym"><SUP>dclxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
and I told him: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be a plank for me to walk across
the mud.’ Would he walk across himself,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote665anc" HREF="#sdendnote665sym"><SUP>dclxv</SUP></A></SUP>
or would he dispose his body otherwise, or would he say ‘No’?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, Bhaddali? Suppose a bhikkhu here were one
liberated-by-wisdom … a body-witness … one attained-toview.. .one
liberated-by-faith … a Dhamma-follower … a faithfollower, and I
told him: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be a plank for me to walk across the
mud.’ Would he walk across himself, or would he dispose his body
otherwise, or would he say ‘No’?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >12.
“What do you think, Bhaddali? Were you on that occasion one
liberated-in-both-ways or [440] one liberated-by-wisdom or a
body-witness or one attained-to-view or one liberated-by-faith or a
Dhamma-follower or a faith-follower?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“Bhaddali,
on that occasion were you not an empty, hollow wrong-doer?”</P>
<P  >13.
“Yes, venerable sir. Venerable sir, a transgression overcame me, in
that like a fool, confused and blundering, when a training precept
was being made known by the Blessed One, I publicly declared in the
Sangha of bhikkhus my unwillingness to undertake the training.
Venerable sir, may the Blessed One forgive my transgression seen as
such for the sake of restraint in the future.”</P>
<P  >“Surely,
Bhaddali, a transgression overcame you, in that like a fool, confused
and blundering, when a training precept was being made known by me,
you publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus your unwillingness to
undertake the training. But since you see your transgression as such
and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma, we forgive you; for it
is growth in the Noble One’s Discipline when one sees one’s
transgression as such and makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma
by undertaking restraint for the future.</P>
<P  >14.
“Here, Bhaddali, some bhikkhu does not fulfil the training in the
Teacher’s Dispensation. He considers thus: ‘Suppose I were to
resort to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree, a
mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle
thicket, an open space, a heap of straw - perhaps I might realise a
superhuman state, a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the
noble ones.’ He resorts to some such secluded resting-place. While
he lives thus withdrawn, the Teacher censures him, wise companions in
the holy life who have made investigation censure him, gods censure
him, and he censures himself. Being censured in this way by the
Teacher, by wise companions in the holy life, by gods, and by
himself, he realises no superhuman state, no distinction in knowledge
and vision worthy of the noble ones. Why is that? That is how it is
with one who does not fulfil the training in the Teacher’s
Dispensation.</P>

resting-place. While he lives thus withdrawn, the Teacher does not
censure him, wise companions in the holy life who have made
investigation do not censure him, gods do not censure him, and he
does not censure himself. Being uncensured in this way by the
Teacher, by wise companions in the holy life, by gods, and by
himself, he realises a superhuman state, a distinction in knowledge
and vision worthy of the noble ones.</P>
<P  >16.
“Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, he enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion. Why is that? That is how it is with one
who fulfils the training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.</P>
<P  >17.
“With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon
and abides in the second jhana … With the fading away as well of
rapture … he enters upon and abides in the third jhana … With the
abandoning of pleasure and pain … he enters upon and abides in the
fourth jhana … Why is that? That is how it is with one who fulfils
the training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.</P>
<P  >18.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified and bright,
unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and
attained to imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the
recollection of past lives … (as Sutta 51, §24) … Thus with
their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.
Why is that? That is how [442] it is with one who fulfils the
training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.</P>
<P  >19.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified and bright …
attained to imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the
passing away and reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 51, §25) …
Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human,
he understands how beings pass on according to their actions. Why is
that? That is how it is with one who fulfils the training in the
Teacher’s Dispensation.</P>
<P  >20.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified and bright …
attained to imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the
destruction of the taints. He understands as it actually is: ‘This
is suffering’ … (as Sutta 51, §26) … He understands as it
actually is: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of the
taints.’</P>
<P  >21.
“When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It is
liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’ Why is that? That is how it is with
one who fulfils the training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.”</P>
<P  >22.
Thereupon the venerable Bhaddali asked: “Venerable sir, what is the
cause, what is the reason, why they take action against some bhikkhu
here by repeatedly admonishing him? What is the cause, what is the
reason, why they do not take such action against some bhikkhu here by
repeatedly admonishing him?”</P>
<P  >23.
“Here, Bhaddali, some bhikkhu is a constant offender with many
offences. When he is corrected by the bhikkhus, he prevaricates,
leads the talk aside, shows disturbance, hate, and bitterness; he
does not proceed rightly, he does not comply, he does not clear
himself, he does not say: ‘Let me so act that the Sangha will be
satisfied.’ [443] Bhikkhus, taking account of this matter, think:
‘It would be good if the venerable ones examine this bhikkhu in
such a way that this litigation against him is not settled too
quickly.’ And the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in such a way that
the litigation against him is not settled too quickly.</P>
<P  >24.
“But here some bhikkhu is a constant offender with many offences.
When he is corrected by the bhikkhus, he does not prevaricate, lead
the talk aside, or show disturbance, hate, and bitterness; he
proceeds rightly, he complies, he clears himself, he says: ‘Let me
so act that the Sangha will be satisfied.’ Bhikkhus, taking account
of this matter, think: ‘It would be good if the venerable ones
examine this bhikkhu in such a way that this litigation against him
is settled quickly.’ And the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in such
a way that the litigation against him is settled quickly.</P>
<P  >25.
“Here some bhikkhu is a chance offender without many offences. When
he is corrected by the bhikkhus, he prevaricates … (repeat rest of
§23) … And the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in such a way that
[444] the litigation against him is not settled too quickly.</P>
<P  >26.
“But here some bhikkhu is a chance offender without many offences.
When he is corrected by the bhikkhus, he does not prevaricate …
(repeat rest of §24) … And the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in
such a way that the litigation against him is settled quickly.</P>
<P  >27.
“Here some bhikkhu progresses by a measure of faith and love.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote666anc" HREF="#sdendnote666sym"><SUP>dclxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
In this case bhikkhus consider thus: ‘Friends, this bhikkhu
progresses by a measure of faith and love. Let him not lose that
measure of faith and love, as he may if we take action against him by
repeatedly admonishing him.’ Suppose a man had only one eye; then
his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, would guard
his eye, thinking: ‘Let him not lose his one eye.’ So too, some
bhikkhu progresses by a measure of faith and love … ‘Let him not
lose that measure of faith and love, as he may if we take action
against him by repeatedly admonishing him.’</P>
<P  >28.
“This is the cause, this is the reason, why they take action
against some bhikkhu here by repeatedly admonishing him; this is the
cause, this is the reason, why they do not take such action against
some bhikkhu here by repeatedly admonishing him.”</P>
<P  >29.
“Venerable sir, what is the cause, what is the reason, why there
were previously [445] fewer training rules and more bhikkhus became
established in final knowledge? What is the cause, what is the
reason, why there are now more training rules and fewer bhikkhus
become established in final knowledge?”</P>
<P  >30.
“That is how it is, Bhaddali. When beings are deteriorating and the
true Dhamma is disappearing, then there are more training rules and
fewer bhikkhus become established in final knowledge. The Teacher
does not make known the training rule for disciples until certain
things that are the basis for taints become manifest here in the
Sangha;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote667anc" HREF="#sdendnote667sym"><SUP>dclxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
but when certain things that are the basis for taints become manifest
here in the Sangha, then the Teacher makes known the training rule
for disciples in order to ward off those things that are the basis
for taints.</P>
<P  >31.
“Those things that are the basis for taints do not become manifest
here in the Sangha until the Sangha has reached greatness; but when
the Sangha has reached greatness, then those things that are the
basis for taints become manifest here in the Sangha, and then the
Teacher makes known the training rule for disciples in order to ward
off those things that are the basis for taints. Those things that are
the basis for taints do not become manifest here in the Sangha until
the Sangha has reached the acme of worldly gain … the acme of fame
… the acme of great learning … the acme of long-standing renown;
but when the Sangha has reached the acme of long-standing renown,
then those things that are the basis for taints become manifest here
in the Sangha, and then the Teacher makes known the training rule for
disciples in order to ward off those things that are the basis for
taints.</P>
<P  >32.
“There were few of you, Bhaddali, when I taught the Dhamma through
the simile of the young thoroughbred colt. Do you remember that,
Bhaddali?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“To
what reason do you attribute that?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I have long been one who did not fulfil the training in the
Teacher’s Dispensation.”</P>
<P  >“That
is not the only cause or the only reason. But rather, by encompassing
your mind with my mind, I have long known you thus: ‘When I am
teaching the Dhamma, this misguided man does not heed it, does not
give it attention, does not engage it with all his mind, does not
hear the Mamma with eager ears.’ Still, Bhaddali, I will teach you
the Dhamma through the simile of the young thoroughbred colt. Listen
and attend closely [446] to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” the venerable Bhaddali replied.</P>
<P  >The
Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >33.
“Bhaddali, suppose a clever horse-trainer obtains a fine
thoroughbred colt. He first makes him get used to wearing the bit.
While the colt is being made to get used to wearing the bit, because
he is doing something that he has never done before, he displays some
contortion, writhing, and vacillation, but through constant
repetition and gradual practice, he becomes peaceful in that action.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote668anc" HREF="#sdendnote668sym"><SUP>dclxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“When
the colt has become peaceful in that action, the horsetrainer further
makes him get used to wearing the harness. While the colt is being
made to get used to wearing the harness, because he is doing
something that he has never done before, he displays some contortion,
writhing, and vacillation, but through constant repetition and
gradual practice, he becomes peaceful in that action.</P>
<P  >“When
the colt has become peaceful in that action, the horsetrainer further
makes him act in keeping in step, in running in a circle, in
prancing, in galloping, in charging, in the kingly qualities, in the
kingly heritage, in the highest speed, in the highest fleetness, in
the highest gentleness. While the colt is being made to get used to
doing these things, because he is doing something that he has never
done before, he displays some contortion, writhing, and vacillation,
but through constant repetition and gradual practice, he becomes
peaceful in those actions.</P>
<P  >“When
the colt has become peaceful in these actions, the horse-trainer
further rewards him with a rubbing down and a grooming. When a fine
thoroughbred colt possesses these ten factors, he is worthy of the
king, in the king’s service, and considered one of the factors of a
king.</P>
<P  >34.
“So too, Bhaddali, when a bhikkhu possesses ten qualities, he is
worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy
of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the
world. What are the ten? Here, Bhaddali, a bhikkhu possesses the
right view of one beyond training,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote669anc" HREF="#sdendnote669sym"><SUP>dclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
the right intention of one beyond training, the right speech of one
beyond training, the right action of one beyond training, the right
livelihood of one beyond training, the right effort of one beyond
training, [447] the right mindfulness of one beyond training, the
right concentration of one beyond training, the right knowledge of
one beyond training, and the right deliverance of one beyond
training.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote670anc" HREF="#sdendnote670sym"><SUP>dclxx</SUP></A></SUP>
When a bhikkhu possesses these ten qualities, he is worthy of gifts,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential
salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Bhaddali was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
