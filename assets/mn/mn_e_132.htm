132. Anandabhaddekaratta Sutta - Ananda and One Fortunate Attachment</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Ananda was instructing, urging,
rousing, and encouraging [190] the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma
in the assembly hall. He was reciting the summary and exposition of
“One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.”</P>
<P  >Then,
in the evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to the
assembly hall. He sat down on a seat made ready and asked the
bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, who has been instructing, urging, rousing, and
encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma in the assembly
hall? Who has been reciting the summary and exposition of ‘One Who
has One Fortunate Attachment’?”</P>
<P  >“It
was the venerable Ananda, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One asked the venerable Ananda: “Ananda, how were you
instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus with talk
on the Dhamma, and reciting the summary and exposition of ‘One Who
Has One Fortunate Attachment’?”</P>
<P  >3-10.
“I was doing so thus, venerable sir: [191]</P>
<P >
‘Let not a person revive the past …</P>
<P >
(Repeat the whole of the last sutta, §§3-10 up to:)</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment.’</P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >11.
“I was instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the bhikkhus
with talk on the Dhamma thus, and reciting the summary and exposition
of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment’ thus.”</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Ananda! It is good that you were instructing, urging, rousing,
and encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the</P>
<P  >Dhamma
thus, and reciting the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has One
Fortunate Attachment’ thus:</P>
<P  >12-19.
“Let not a person revive the past …</P>
<P >
(Repeat the whole of the last sutta, §§3-10 up to:)</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment.”</P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
