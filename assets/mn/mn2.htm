<H2 NAME="Heading0"  >Introduction</H2>
<H3 >THE MAJJHIMA NIKAYA AS A COLLECTION</H3>
<P  >THE
MAJJHIMA NIKAYA is the second collection of the Buddha’s discourses
found in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon. Its title means
literally the Middle Collection, and it is so called because the
suttas it contains are generally of middle length, compared with the
longer suttas of the Digha Nikaya, which precedes it, and the shorter
suttas making up the two major collections that follow it, the
Samyutta Nikaya and the Anguttara Nikaya.</P>
<P  >The
Majjhima Nikaya consists of 152 suttas. These are divided into three
parts called Sets of Fifty (pannasa), though the last set actually
contains fifty-two suttas. Within each part the suttas are further
grouped into chapters or divisions (vagga) of ten suttas each, the
next to the last division containing twelve suttas. The names
assigned to these divisions are often derived solely from the titles
of their opening sutta (or, in some cases, pair of suttas) and thus
are scarcely indicative of the material found within the divisions
themselves. A partial exception is the Middle Fifty, where the
division titles usually refer to the principal type of interlocutor
or key figure in each of the suttas they contain. Even then the
connection between the title and the contents is sometimes tenuous.
The entire system of classification appears to have been devised more
for the purpose of convenience than because of any essential
homogeneity of subject matter in the suttas comprised under a single
division.</P>
<P  >There
is also no particular pedagogical sequence in the suttas, no
unfolding development of thought. Thus while different suttas
illuminate each other and one will fill in ideas merely suggested by
another, virtually any sutta may be taken up for individual study and
will be found comprehensible on its own. Of course, the study of the
entire compilation will naturally yield the richest harvest of
understanding.</P>
<P  >If
the Majjhima Nikaya were to be characterised by a single phrase to
distinguish it from among the other books of the Pali Canon, this
might be done by describing it as the collection that combines the
richest variety of contextual settings with the deepest and most
comprehensive assortment of teachings. Like the Digha Nikaya, the
Majjhima is replete with drama and narrative, while lacking much of
its predecessor’s tendency towards imaginative embellishment and
profusion of legend. Like the Samyutta, it contains some of the
profoundest discourses in the Canon, disclosing the Buddha’s
radical insights into the nature of existence; and like the
Anguttara, it covers a wide range of topics of practical
applicability. In contrast to those two Nikayas, however, the
Majjhima sets forth this material not in the form of short,
self-contained utterances, but in the context of a fascinating
procession of scenarios that exhibit the Buddha’s resplendence of
wisdom, his skill in adapting his teachings to the needs and
proclivities of his interlocutors, his wit and gentle humour, his
majestic sublimity, and his compassionate humanity.</P>
<P  >Naturally
the greatest number of discourses in the Majjhima are addressed to
the bhikkhus - the monks - since they lived in closest proximity to
the Master and had followed him into homelessness to take upon
themselves his complete course of training. But in the Majjhima we do
not meet the Buddha only in his role as head of the Order. Repeatedly
we see him engaged in living dialogue with people from the many
different strata of ancient Indian society - with kings and princes,
with brahmins and ascetics, with simple villagers and erudite
philosophers, with earnest seekers and vain disputants. It is perhaps
in this scripture above all others that the Buddha emerges in the
role ascribed to him in the canonical verse of homage to the Blessed
One as “the incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, the teacher
of gods and humans.”</P>
<P  >It
is not the Buddha alone who appears in the Majjhima in the role of
teacher. The work also introduces us to the accomplished disciples he
produced who carried on the transmission of his teaching. Of the 152
suttas in the collection, nine are spoken by the venerable Sariputta,
the General of the Dhamma; three of these (MN 9, MN 28, MN 141) have
become basic texts for the study of Buddhist doctrine in monastic
schools throughout the Theravada Buddhist world. The venerable
Ananda, the Buddha’s personal attendant during the last twenty-five
years of his life, delivers seven suttas and participates in many
more. Four suttas are spoken by the venerable Maha Kaccana, who
excelled in elaborating upon the brief but enigmatic sayings of the
Master, and two by the second chief disciple, the venerable Maha
Moggallana, one of which (MN 15) has been recommended for a monk’s
daily reflections. A dialogue between the venerable Sariputta and the
venerable Punna Mantaniputta (MN 24) explores a scheme of seven
stages of purification that was to form the outline for Acariya
Buddhaghosa’s great treatise on the Buddhist path, the
Visuddhimagga. Another dialogue (MN 44) introduces the bhikkhuni
Dhammadinna, whose replies to a series of probing questions were so
adroit that the Buddha sealed them for posterity with the words “I
would have explained it to you in the same way.”</P>
<P  >The
formats of the suttas are also highly variegated. The majority take
the form of discourses proper, expositions of the teaching that pour
forth uninterrupted from the mouth of the Enlightened One. A few
among these are delivered in a series of unadorned instructional
propositions or guidelines to practice, but most are interlaced with
striking similes and parables, which flash through and light up the
dense mass of doctrine in ways that impress it deeply upon the mind.
Other suttas unfold in dialogue and discussion, and in some the
dramatic or narrative element predominates. Perhaps the best known
and most widely appreciated among these is the Angulimala Sutta (MN
86), which relates how the Buddha subdued the notorious bandit
Angulimala and transformed him into an enlightened saint. Equally
moving, though in a different way, is the story of Ratthapala (MN
82), the youth of wealthy family whose precocious insight into the
universality of suffering was so compelling that he was prepared to
die rather than accept his parents’ refusal to permit him to go
forth into homelessness. Several suttas centre upon debate, and these
highlight the Buddha’s wit and delicate sense of irony as well as
his dialectical skills. Particular mention might be made of MN 35 and
MN 56, with their subtle humour leavening the seriousness of their
contents.</P>
<P  >In
a class of its own is the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (MN 49), in which
the Buddha visits the Brahma-world to detach a deluded deity from his
illusions of grandeur and soon finds himself locked in a gripping
contest with Mara the Evil One - an inconceivable alliance of
Divinity and Devil defending the sanctity of being against the
Buddha’s call for deliverance into Nibbana, the cessation of being.</P>
<H3 >THE BUDDHA IN THE MAJJHIMA NIKAYA</H3>
<P  >Biographical
information for its own sake was never an overriding concern of the
redactors of the Pali Canon, and thus the data the Majjhima provides
on the life of the Buddha is scanty and uncoordinated, included
principally because of the light it sheds on the Buddha as the ideal
exemplar of the spiritual quest and the fully qualified teacher.
Nevertheless, though it subordinates biography to other concerns, the
Majjhima does give us the fullest canonical account of the Master’s
early life as a Bodhisatta, a seeker of enlightenment. With the Digha
it shares the miraculous story of his conception and birth (MN 123),
but its version of his great renunciation has been stripped to bare
essentials and related in the stark terms of existential realism. In
his youth, having seen through the sensual delights to which his
princely status entitled him (MN 75.10), the Bodhisatta decided that
it was futile to pursue things subject like himself to ageing and
death and thus, with his parents weeping, he left the home life and
went in search of the ageless and deathless, Nibbana (MN 26.13). MN
26 tells of his discipleship under two accomplished meditation
teachers of the day, his mastery of their systems, and his consequent
disillusionment. MN 12 and MN 36 describe his ascetic practices
during his six hard years of striving, a path he pursued almost to
the point of death. MN 26 and MN 36 both relate in lean and
unembellished terms his attainment of enlightenment, which they view
from different angles, while MN 26 takes us past the enlightenment to
the decision to teach and the instruction of his first disciples.
From that point on connected biography breaks off in the Majjhima and
can only be reconstructed partially and hypothetically.</P>
<P  >Again,
despite the absence of any systematic account, the Majjhima offers a
sufficient number of cameo portraits of the Buddha for us to obtain,
with the aid of information provided by other sources, a fairly
satisfactory picture of his daily activities and annual routine
during the forty-five years of his ministry. A commentarial text
shows the Buddha’s daily schedule as having been divided between
periods of instructing the bhikkhus, giving discourses to the laity,
and secluded meditation, during which he usually dwelt either in the
“abode of voidness” (MN 121.3, MN 122.6) or in the attainment of
great compassion. The day’s single meal was always taken in the
forenoon, either received by invitation or collected on almsround,
and his sleep was restricted to a few hours per night, except in the
summer, when he rested briefly during the middle of the day (MN
36.46). The annual routine was determined by the Indian climate,
which divided the year into three seasons - a cold season from
November through February, a hot season from March through June, and
a rainy season from July through October. As was customary among the
ascetics of ancient India, the Buddha and his monastic community
would remain at a fixed residence during the rainy season, when
torrential rains and swollen rivers made travel almost impossible.
During the rest of the year he would wander through the Ganges Valley
expounding his teachings to all who were prepared to listen.</P>
<P  >The
Buddha’s main seats of residence for the rains retreat (vassa) were
located at Savatthi in the state of Kosala and Rajagaha in the state
of Magadha. At Savatthi he would usually stay at Jeta’s Grove, a
park offered to him by the wealthy merchant Anathapindika, and
accordingly a great number of Majjhima discourses are recorded as
having been given there. Occasionally at Savatthi he would reside
instead at the Eastern Park, offered by the devout lay-woman Visakha,
also known as “Migara’s mother.” In Rajagaha he often stayed at
the Bamboo Grove, offered by the king of Magadha, Seniya Bimbisara,
or for greater seclusion, on Vulture Peak outside the city. His
wanderings, during which he was usually accompanied by a large
retinue of bhikkhus, ranged from the Angan country (close to modern
West Bengal) to the Himalayan foothills and the Kuru country (modern
Delhi). Occasionally, when he saw that a special case required his
individual attention, he would leave the Sangha and travel alone (see
MN 75, MN 86, MN 140).</P>
<P  >Although
the Canon is precise and reliable in affording such details, for the
early Buddhist community interest focuses upon the Buddha not so much
in his concrete historical particularity as in his archetypal
significance. Whereas outsiders might view him as merely one among
the many spiritual teachers of the day - as “the recluse Gotama”
- to his disciples “he is vision, he is knowledge, he is the
Dhamma, he is the holy one, … the giver of the Deathless, the lord
of the Dhamma, the Tathagata” (MN 18.12). The last term in this
series is the epithet the Buddha uses most often when referring to
himself and it underscores his significance as the Great Arrival who
brings to fulfilment a cosmic, repetitive pattern of events. The Pali
commentators explain the word as meaning “thus come” (tatha
agata) and “thus gone” (tat ha Bata), that is, the one who comes
into our midst bearing the message of deathlessness to which he has
gone by his own practice of the path. As the Tathagata he possesses
the ten powers of knowledge and. the four intrepidities, which enable
him to roar his “lion’s roar” in the assemblies (MN 12.9-20).
He is not merely a wise sage or a benevolent moralist but the latest
in the line of Fully Enlightened Ones, each of whom arises singly in
an age of spiritual darkness, discovers the deepest truths about the
nature of existence, and establishes a Dispensation (sasana) through
which the path to deliverance again becomes accessible to the world.
Even those of his disciples who have attained unsurpassable vision,
practice, and deliverance still honour and venerate the Tathagata as
one who, enlightened himself, teaches others for the sake of their
enlightenment (MN 35.26). Looking back at him following his demise,
the first generation of monks could say: “The Blessed One was the
arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of the unproduced path,
the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the knower of the path,
the finder of the path, the one skilled in the path,” which is
followed by and attained to afterwards by his disciples (MN 108.5).</P>
<H3 >THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS</H3>
<P  >The
Buddha’s teaching is called the Dhamma, a word that can signify
both the truth transmitted by the teaching and the conceptual-verbal
medium by which that truth is expressed in order that it can be
communicated and made comprehensible. The Dhamma is not a body of
immutable dogmas or a system of speculative thought. It is
essentially a means, a raft for crossing over from the “near shore”
of ignorance, craving, and suffering to the “far shore” of
transcendental peace and freedom (MN 22.13). Because his aim in
setting forth his teaching is a pragmatic one - deliverance from
suffering - the Buddha can dismiss the whole gamut of metaphysical
speculation as a futile endeavour. Those committed to it he compares
to a man struck by a poisoned arrow who refuses the surgeon’s help
until he knows the details about his assailant and his weaponry (MN
63.5). Being struck by the arrow of craving, afflicted by ageing and
death, humanity is in urgent need of help. The remedy the Buddha
brings as the surgeon for the world (MN 105.27) is the Dhamma, which
discloses both the truth of our existential plight and the means by
which we can heal our wounds.</P>
<P  >The
Dhamma that the Buddha discovered and taught consists at its core in
Four Noble Truths:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P >the noble
truth of suffering (dukkha)</P>
<LI><P >the noble
truth of the origin of suffering (dukkhasamudaya)</P>
<LI><P >the noble
truth of the cessation of suffering (dukkhanirodha)</P>
<LI><P >the noble
truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering
(dukkhanirodhagamini patipada)</P>
</UL>
<P  >It
is these four truths that the Buddha awakened to on the night of his
enlightenment (MN 4.31, MN 36.42), made known to the world when he
set rolling the matchless Wheel of the Dhamma at Benares (MN 141.2),
and held aloft through the forty-five years of his ministry as “the
teaching special to the Buddhas” (MN 56.18). In the Majjhima Nikaya
the Four Noble Truths are expounded concisely at MN 9.14-18 and in
detail in MN 141, while in MN 28 the venerable Sariputta develops an
original exposition of the truths unique to that sutta. Yet, though
they may be brought forth explicitly only on occasion, the Four Noble
Truths structure the entire teaching of the Buddha, containing its
many other principles just as the elephant’s footprint contains the
footprints of all other animals (MN 28.2).</P>
<P  >The
pivotal notion around which the truths revolve is that of dukkha,
translated here as “suffering.” The Pali word originally meant
simply pain and suffering, a meaning it retains in the texts when it
is used as a quality of feeling: in these cases it has been rendered
as “pain” or “painful.” As the first noble truth, however,
dukkha has a far wider significance, reflective of a comprehensive
philosophical vision. While it draws its affective colouring from its
connection with pain and suffering, and certainly includes these, it
points beyond such restrictive meanings to the inherent
unsatisfactoriness of everything conditioned. This unsatisfactoriness
of the conditioned is due to its impermanence, its vulnerability to
pain, and its inability to provide complete and lasting satisfaction.</P>
<P  >The
notion of impermanence (aniccata) forms the bedrock for the Buddha’s
teaching, having been the initial insight that impelled the
Bodhisatta to leave the palace in search of a path to enlightenment.
Impermanence, in the Buddhist view, comprises the totality of
conditioned existence, ranging in scale from the cosmic to the
microscopic. At the far end of the spectrum the Buddha’s vision
reveals a universe of immense dimensions evolving and disintegrating
in repetitive cycles throughout beginningless time - “many aeons of
world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of
world-contraction and expansion” (MN 4.27). In the middle range the
mark of impermanence comes to manifestation in our inescapable
mortality, our condition of being bound to ageing, sickness, and
death (MN 26.5), of possessing a body that is subject “to being
worn and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration” (MN 74.9).
And at the close end of the spectrum, the Buddha’s teaching
discloses the radical impermanence uncovered only by sustained
attention to experience in its living immediacy: the fact that all
the constituents of our being, bodily and mental, are in constant
process, arising and passing away in rapid succession from moment to
moment without any persistent underlying substance. In the very act
of observation they are undergoing “destruction, vanishing, fading
away, and ceasing” (MN 74.11).</P>
<P  >This
characteristic of impermanence that marks everything conditioned
leads directly to the recognition of the universality of dukkha or
suffering. The Buddha underscores this all pervasive aspect of dukkha
when, in his explanation of the first noble truth, he says, “In
short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering.” The
five aggregates affected by clinging (panc’upadanakkhandha) are a
classificatory scheme that the Buddha had devised for demonstrating
the composite nature of personality. The scheme comprises every
possible type of conditioned state, which it distributes into five
categories - material form, feeling, perception, mental formations,
and consciousness. The aggregate of material form (rupa) includes the
physical body with its sense faculties as well as external material
objects. The aggregate of feeling (vedana) is the affective element
in experience, either pleasant, painful, or neutral. Perception
(sauna), the third aggregate, is the factor responsible for noting
the qualities of things and also accounts for recognition and memory.
The formations aggregate (sankhara) is an umbrella term that includes
all volitional, emotive, and intellective aspects of mental life. And
consciousness (vinnana), the fifth aggregate, is the basic awareness
of an object indispensable to all cognition. As the venerable
Sariputta shows in his masterly analysis of the first noble truth,
representatives of all five aggregates are present on every occasion
of experience, arising in connection with each of the six sense
faculties and their objects (MN 28.28).</P>
<P  >The
Buddha’s statement that the five aggregates are dukkha thus reveals
that the very things we identify with and hold to as the basis for
happiness, rightly seen, are the basis for the suffering that we
dread. Even when we feel ourselves comfortable and secure, the
instability of the aggregates is itself a source of oppression and
keeps us perpetually exposed to suffering in its more blatant forms.
The whole situation becomes multiplied further to dimensions beyond
calculation when we take into account the Buddha’s disclosure of
the fact of rebirth. All beings in whom ignorance and craving remain
present wander on in the cycle of repeated existence, samsara, in
which each turn brings them the suffering of new birth, ageing,
illness, and death. All states of existence within samsara, being
necessarily transitory and subject to change, are incapable of
providing lasting security. Life in any world is unstable, it is
swept away, it has no shelter and protector, nothing of its own (MN
82.36).</P>
<H3 >THE TEACHING OF NON-SELF</H3>
<P  >Inextricably
tied up with impermanence and suffering is a third principle
intrinsic to all phenomena of existence. This is the characteristic
of non-self (anatta), and the three together are called the three
marks or characteristics (tilakkhana). The Buddha teaches, contrary
to our most cherished beliefs, that our personality - the five
aggregates - cannot be identified as self, as an enduring and
substantial ground of personal identity. The notion of self has only
a conventional validity, as a convenient shorthand device for
denoting a composite insubstantial situation. It does not signify any
ultimate immutable entity subsisting at the core of our being. The
bodily and mental factors are transitory phenomena, constantly
arising and passing away, processes creating the appearance of
selfhood through their causal continuity and interdependent
functioning. Nor does the Buddha posit a self outside and beyond the
five aggregates. The notion of selfhood, treated as an ultimate, he
regards as a product of ignorance, and all the diverse attempts to
substantiate this notion by identifying it with some aspect of the
personality he describes as “clinging to a doctrine of self.”</P>
<P  >In
several suttas in the Majjhima Nikaya, the Buddha gives forceful
expression to his repudiation of views of self. In MN 102 he
undertakes a far-reaching survey of the various propositions put
forth about the self, declaring them all to be “conditioned and
gross.” In MN 2.8 six views of self are branded as “the thicket
of views, the wilderness of views, the contortion of views, the
vacillation of views, the fetter of views.” In MN 11 he compares
his teaching point by point with those of other recluses and brahmins
and shows that beneath their apparent similarities, they finally
diverge on just this one crucial point - the rejection of views of
self - which undermines the agreements. MN 22 offers a series of
arguments against the view of self, culminating in the Buddha’s
declaration that he does not see any doctrine of self that would not
lead to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, ‘and despair. In his map
of the steps to liberation, personality view (sakkayaditthi), the
positing of a self in relation to the five aggregates, is held to be
the first fetter to be broken with the arising of the “vision of
the Dhamma.”</P>
<P  >The
principle of non-self is shown in the suttas to follow logically from
the two marks of impermanence and suffering. The standard formula
states that what is impermanent is pain or suffering, and what is
impermanent, suffering, and subject to change cannot be regarded as
mine, I, or self (MN 22.26, MN 35.20, etc.). Other passages highlight
the relationship among the three characteristics from different
angles. MN 28 points out that when the external physical elements -
earth, water, fire, and air - vast as they are, are periodically
destroyed in cosmic cataclysms, there can be no considering this
transitory body as self. MN 148 demonstrates by a reductio ad
absurdum argument that impermanence implies non-self: when all the
factors of being are clearly subject to rise and fall, to identify
anything among them with self is to be left with the untenable thesis
that self is subject to rise and fall. MN 35.19 connects the mark of
non-self with that of dukkha by arguing that because we cannot bend
the five aggregates to our will, they cannot be taken as mine, I, or
self.</P>
<H3 >THE ORIGIN AND CESSATION OF SUFFERING</H3>
<P  >The
second of the Four Noble Truths makes known the origin or cause of
suffering, which the Buddha identifies as craving (tanha) in its
three aspects: craving for sensual pleasures; craving for being, that
is, for continued existence; and craving for nonbeing, that is, for
personal annihilation. The third truth states the converse of the
second truth, that with the elimination of craving the suffering that
originates from it will cease without remainder.</P>
<P  >The
Buddha’s discovery of the causal link between craving and suffering
accounts for the apparent “pessimistic” streak that emerges in
several suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya: in MN 13 with its disquisition
on the dangers in sensual pleasures, form, and feeling; in MN 10 and
MN 119 with their cemetery meditations; in MN 22, MN 54, and MN 75
with their shocking similes for sensual pleasures. Such teachings are
part of the Buddha’s tactical approach to guiding his disciples to
liberation. By its own inherent nature craving springs up and thrives
wherever it finds something that appears pleasant and delightful. It
proliferates through mistaken perception - the perception of sense
objects as enjoyable - and thus to break the grip of craving on the
mind, exhortation is often not enough. The Buddha must make people
see that the things they yearn for and frantically pursue are really
suffering, and he does this by exposing the dangers concealed beneath
their sweet and charming exteriors.</P>
<P  >Although
the second and third noble truths have an immediate psychological
validity, they also have a deeper aspect brought to light in the
suttas. The middle two truths as stated in the general formulation of
the Four Noble Truths are actually telescoped versions of a longer
formulation that discloses the origin and cessation of bondage in
samsara. The doctrine in which this expanded version of the two
truths is set forth is called paticca samuppada, dependent
origination. In its fullest statement the doctrine spells out the
origination and cessation of suffering in terms of twelve factors
connected together in eleven propositions. This formulation, laid
down schematically, will be found at MN 38.17 in its order of arising
and at MN 38.20 in its order of ceasing. MN 115.11 includes both
sequences together preceded by a statement of the general principle
of conditionality that underlies the applied doctrine. A more
elaborate version giving a factorial analysis of each term in the
series is presented at MN 9.21-66, and a version exemplified in the
course of an individual life at MN 38.26-40. Condensed versions are
also found, notably at MN 1.171, MN 11.16, and MN 75.24-25. The
venerable Sariputta quotes the Buddha as saying that one who sees
dependent origination sees the Dhamma and one who sees the Dhamma
sees dependent origination (MN 28.28).</P>
<P  >According
to the usual interpretation, the series of twelve factors extends
over three lives and divides into causal and resultant phases. The
gist of it can be briefly explained as follows. Because of ignorance
(avijja) - defined as non-knowledge of the Four Noble Truths - a
person engages in volitional actions or kamma, which may be bodily,
verbal, or mental, wholesome or unwholesome. These kammic actions are
the formations (sankhara), and they ripen in states of consciousness
(vinnana) - first as the rebirth-consciousness at the moment of
conception and thereafter as the passive states of consciousness
resulting from kamma that matures in the course of a lifetime. Along
with consciousness there arises mentality-materiality (namarupa), the
psychophysical organism, which is equipped with the sixfold base
(salayatana), the five physical sense faculties and mind as the
faculty of the higher cognitive functions. Via the sense faculties
contact (phassa) takes place between consciousness and its objects,
and contact conditions feeling (vedana). The links from consciousness
through feeling are the products of past kamma, of the causal phase
represented by ignorance and formations. With the next link the
kammically active phase of the present</P>
<P  >life
begins, productive of a new existence in the future. Conditioned by
feeling, craving (tanha) arises, this being the second noble truth.
When craving intensifies it gives rise to clinging (upadana), through
which one again engages in volitional actions pregnant with a renewal
of existence (bhava). The new existence begins with birth (jati),
which inevitably leads to ageing and death (jaramarana).</P>
<P  >The
teaching of dependent origination also shows how the round of
existence can be broken. With the arising of true knowledge, full
penetration of the Four Noble Truths, ignorance is eradicated.
Consequently the mind no longer indulges in craving and clinging,
action loses its potential to generate rebirth, and deprived thus of
its fuel, the round comes to an end. This marks the goal of the
teaching signalled by the third noble truth, the cessation of
suffering.</P>
<H3 >NIBBANA</H3>
<P  >The
state that supervenes when ignorance and craving have been uprooted
is called Nibbana (Sanskrit, Nirvana), and no conception in the
Buddha’s teaching has proved so refractory to conceptual pinning
down as this one. In a way such elusiveness is only to be expected,
since Nibbana is described precisely as “profound, hard to see and
hard to understand, … unattainable by mere reasoning” (MN 26.19).
Yet in this same passage the Buddha also says that Nibbana is to be
experienced by the wise and in the suttas he gives enough indications
of its nature to convey some idea of its desirability.</P>
<P  >The
Pali Canon offers sufficient evidence to dispense with the opinion of
some interpreters that Nibbana is sheer annihilation; even the more
sophisticated view that Nibbana is merely the destruction of
defilements and the extinction of existence cannot stand up under
scrutiny. Probably the most compelling testimony against that view is
the well-known passage from the Udana that declares with reference to
Nibbana that “there is an unborn, unbecome, unmade, unconditioned,”
the existence of which makes possible “escape from the born,
become, made, and conditioned” (Ud 8:3/80). The Majjhima Nikaya
characterises Nibbana in similar ways. It is “the unborn, unageing,
unailing, deathless, sorrowless, undefiled supreme security from
bondage,” which the Buddha attained to on the night of his
enlightenment (MN 26.18). Its pre-eminent reality is affirmed by the
Buddha when he calls Nibbana the supreme foundation of truth, whose
nature is undeceptive and which ranks as the supreme noble truth (MN
140.26). Nibbana cannot be perceived by those who live in lust and
hate, but it can be seen with the arising of spiritual vision, and by
fixing the mind upon it in the depths of meditation, the disciple can
attain the destruction of the taints (MN 26.19, MN 75.24, MN 64.9).</P>
<P  >The
Buddha does not devote many words to a philosophical definition of
Nibbana. One reason is that Nibbana, being unconditioned,
transcendent, and supramundane, does not easily lend itself to
definition in terms of concepts that are inescapably tied to the
conditioned, manifest, and mundane. Another is that the Buddha’s
objective is the practical one of leading beings to release from
suffering, and thus his principal approach to the characterisation of
Nibbana is to inspire the incentive to attain it and to show what
must be done to accomplish this. To show Nibbana as desirable, as the
aim of striving, he describes it as the highest bliss, as the supreme
state of sublime peace, as the ageless, deathless, and sorrowless, as
the supreme security from bondage. To show what must be done to
attain Nibbana, to indicate that the goal implies a definite task, he
describes it as the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of
all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion (MN 26.19).
Above all, Nibbana is the cessation of suffering, and for those who
seek an end to suffering such a designation is enough to beckon them
towards the path.</P>
<H3 >THE WAY TO THE CESSATION OF SUFFERING</H3>
<P  >The
fourth noble truth completes the pattern established by the first
three truths by revealing the means to eliminate craving and thereby
bring an end to suffering. This truth teaches the “Middle Way”
discovered by the Buddha, the Noble Eightfold Path:</P>
<OL>
<LI><P >right view
(samma ditthi)</P>
<LI><P >right
intention (samma sankappa)</P>
<LI><P >right speech
(samma vaca)</P>
<LI><P >right action
(samma kammanta)</P>
<LI><P >right
livelihood (samma ajiva)</P>
<LI><P >right effort
(samma vayama)</P>
<LI><P >right
mindfulness (samma sati)</P>
<LI><P >right
concentration (samma samadhi)</P>
</OL>
<P  >Mentioned
countless times throughout the Majjhima Nikaya, the Noble Eightfold
Path is explained in detail in two full suttas. MN 141 gives a
factorial analysis of the eight components of the path using the
definitions that are standard in the Pali Canon; MN 117 expounds the
path from a different angle under the rubric of “noble right
concentration with its supports and its requisites.” The Buddha
there makes the important distinction between the mundane and
supramundane stages of the path, defines the first five factors for
both stages, and shows how the path factors function in unison in the
common task of providing an outlet from suffering. Other suttas
explore in greater detail individual components of the path. Thus MN
9 provides an in-depth exposition of right view, MN 10 of right
mindfulness, MN 19 of right intention. MN 44.11 explains that the
eight factors can be incorporated into three “aggregates” of
training. Right speech, right action, and right livelihood make up
the aggregate of virtue or moral discipline (sila); right effort,
right mindfulness, and right concentration make up the aggregate of
concentration (samadhi); and right view and right intention make tip
the aggregate of understanding or wisdom (panna). This threefold
sequence in turn serves as the basic outline for the gradual
training, to be discussed later.</P>
<P  >In
the Pali Canon the practices conducing to Nibbana are often
elaborated into a more complex set comprising seven groups of
intersecting factors. The later tradition designates them the
thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment (bodhipakkhiya dhamma), but
the Buddha himself simply speaks of them without a collective name as
“the things that I have taught you after directly knowing them”
(MN 103.3, MN 104.5). Towards the end of his life he stressed to the
Sangha that the long duration of his teaching in the world depends
upon the accurate preservation of these factors and their being
practised by his followers in harmony, free from contention.</P>
<P  >The
constituents of this set are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI><P >the four
foundations of mindfulness (satipatthana)</P>
<LI><P >the four right
kinds of striving (sammappadhana)</P>
<LI><P >the four bases
for spiritual power (iddhipada)</P>
<LI><P >the five
faculties (indriya)</P>
<LI><P >the five
powers (bala)</P>
<LI><P >the seven
enlightenment factors (bojjhanga)</P>
<LI><P >the Noble
Eightfold Path (ariya atthangika magga)</P>
</UL>
<P  >Each
group is defined in full at MN 77.15-21. As examination will show,
most of these groups are simply subdivisions or rearrangements of
factors of the eightfold path made to highlight different aspects of
the practice. Thus, for example, the four foundations of mindfulness
are an elaboration of right mindfulness; the four right kinds of
striving, an elaboration of right effort. The development of the
groups is therefore integral and not sequential. MN 118, for example,
shows how the practice of the four foundations of mindfulness fulfils
the development of the seven enlightenment factors, and MN 149.10
states that one engaged in insight meditation on the senses brings to
maturity all thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment.</P>
<P  >Factorial
analysis of the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment brings to
light the central importance of four factors among them - energy,
mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. From this a clear picture of
the essential practice can be sketched. One begins with a conceptual
understanding of the Dhamma and an intention to achieve the goal, the
first two path factors. Then, out of faith, one accepts the moral
discipline regulating speech, action, and livelihood. With virtue as
a basis one energetically applies the mind to cultivating the four
foundations of mindfulness. As mindfulness matures it issues in
deepened concentration, and the concentrated mind, by investigation,
arrives at wisdom, a penetrative understanding of the principles
originally grasped only conceptually.</P>
<H3 >THE GRADUAL TRAINING</H3>
<P  >In
the Majjhima Nikaya the Buddha often expounds the practice of the
path as a gradual training (anupubbasikkha), which unfolds in stages
from the first step to the final goal. This gradual training is a
finer subdivision of the threefold division of the path into virtue,
concentration, and wisdom. Invariably in the suttas the sequence on
the gradual training is shown to start with the going forth into
homelessness and the adoption of the lifestyle of a bhikkhu, a
Buddhist monk. This immediately calls attention to the importance of
the monastic life in the Buddha’s Dispensation. In principle the
entire practice of the Noble Eightfold Path is open to people from
any mode of life, monastic or lay, and the Buddha confirms that many
among his lay followers were accomplished in the Dhamma and had
attained the first three of the four supramundane stages (MN
68.18-23; MN 73.9-22; the Theravadin position is that lay followers
can also attain the fourth stage, arahantship, but having done so
they immediately seek the going forth or pass away). However, the
fact remains that the household life inevitably tends to impede the
single hearted quest for deliverance by fostering a multitude of
worldly concerns and personal attachments. Hence the Buddha himself
went forth into homelessness as the preliminary step in his own noble
quest, and after his enlightenment he established the Sangha, the
order of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, as the resort for those who wish to
devote themselves fully to the practice of his teaching undeflected
by the cares of household life.</P>
<P  >The
main paradigm for the gradual training found in the Majjhima Nikaya
is that laid out in MN 27 and MN 51; alternative versions are found
at MN 38, MN 39, MN 53, MN 107, and MN 125, and some of the more
important variations will be briefly noted. The sequence opens with
the appearance of a Tathagata in the world and his exposition of the
Dhamma, hearing which the disciple acquires faith and follows the
Teacher into homelessness. Having gone forth, he undertakes and
observes the rules of discipline that promote the purification of
conduct and livelihood. The next three steps - contentment, restraint
of the sense faculties, and mindfulness and full awareness - are
intended to internalise the process of purification and thereby
bridge the transition from virtue to concentration. Alternative
versions (MN 39, MN 53, MN 107, MN 125) insert two additional steps
here, moderation in eating and devotion to wakefulness.</P>
<P  >The
direct training in concentration comes to prominence in the section
on the abandonment of the five hindrances. The five hindrances -
sensual desire, ill will, sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse,
and doubt - are the primary obstacles to meditative development and
their removal is therefore essential for the mind to be brought to a
state of calm and unification. In the sequence on the gradual
training the overcoming of the hindrances is treated only
schematically; other parts of the Canon provide more practical
instruction, amplified still more in the commentaries. The passage on
the hindrances is graced in MN 39 by a series of similes illustrating
the contrast between the bondage imposed by the hindrances and the
joyful sense of freedom that is won when they are abandoned.</P>
<P  >The
next stage in the sequence describes the attainment of the jhanas,
profound states of concentration in which the mind becomes fully
absorbed in its object. The Buddha enumerates four jhanas, named
simply after their numerical position in the series, each more
refined and elevated than its predecessor. The jhanas are always
described by the same formulas, which in several suttas (MN 39, MN
77, MN 119) are augmented by similes of great beauty. Although in the
Theravada tradition the jhanas are not regarded as indispensable to
the attainment of enlightenment, the Buddha invariably includes them
in the full gradual training because of the contribution they make to
the intrinsic perfection of the path and because the deep
concentration they induce provides a solid base for the cultivation
of insight. While still mundane the jhanas are the “footsteps of
the Tathagata” (MN 27.19-22) and foretokens of the bliss of Nibbana
that lies at the training’s end.</P>
<P  >From
the fourth jhana three alternative lines of further development
become possible. In a number of passages outside the sequence on the
gradual training (MN 8, MN 25, MN 26, MN 66, etc.) the Buddha
mentions four meditative states that continue the mental unification
established by the jhanas. These states, described as “the
liberations that are peaceful and immaterial,” are, like the
jhanas, also mundane. Distinguished from the jhanas by their
transcendence of the subtle mental image that forms the object in the
jhanas, they are named after their own exalted objects: the base of
infinite space, the base of infinite consciousness, the base of
nothingness, and the base of neither-perceptionnor-non-perception. In
the Pali commentaries these states came to be called the immaterial
or formless jhanas (arupajjhana).</P>
<P  >A
second line of development disclosed by the suttas is the acquisition
of supernormal knowledge. The Buddha frequently mentions six types as
a group, which come to be called the six kinds of direct knowledge
(chalabhinna; the expression does not occur in the Majjhima). The
last of these, the knowledge of the destruction of the taints, is
supramundane and thus properly belongs to the third line of
development. But the other five are all mundane, products of the
extraordinarily powerful degree of mental concentration achieved in
the fourth jhana: the supernormal powers, the divine ear, the ability
to read the minds of others, the recollection of past lives, and the
divine eye (MN 6, MN 73, MN 77, MN 108).</P>
<P  >The
jhanas and the mundane types of direct knowledge by themselves do not
issue in enlightenment and liberation. As lofty and peaceful as these
attainments are, they can only suppress the defilements that sustain
the round of rebirths but cannot eradicate them. To uproot the
defilements at the most fundamental level, and thereby yield the
fruits of enlightenment and deliverance, the meditative process must
be redirected along a third line of development, one which does not
necessarily presuppose the former two. This is the contemplation of
“things as they actually are,” which results in increasingly
deeper insights into the nature of existence and culminates in the
final goal, the attainment of arahantship.</P>
<P  >This
line of development is the one the Buddha pursues in the sequence on
the gradual training, though he precedes it by descriptions of two of
the direct knowledges, the recollection of past lives and the divine
eye. The three together, which figured prominently in the Buddha’s
own enlightenment (MN 4.27-30), are collectively called the three
true knowledges (tevijja). Although the first two among these are not
essential to the realisation of arahantship, we may assume that the
Buddha includes them here because they reveal the truly vast and
profound dimensions of suffering in samsara and thereby prepare the
mind for the penetration of the Four Noble Truths, in which that
suffering is diagnosed and surmounted.</P>
<P  >The
process of contemplation by which the<SPAN LANG="en-GB"> meditator</SPAN>
develops insight is not explicitly shown as such in the sequence on
the gradual training. It is only implied by the exhibiting of its
final fruit, here called the knowledge of the destruction of the
taints. The asavas or taints are a classification of defilements
considered in their role of sustaining the samsaric round. The
commentaries derive the word from a root su meaning “to flow.”
Scholars differ as to whether the flow implied by the prefix a is
inward or outward; hence some have rendered it as “influxes” or
“influences,” others as “outflows” or “effluents.” A
stock passage in the suttas indicates the term’s real significance
independently of etymology when it describes the asavas as states
“that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in
suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death” (MN 36.47,
etc.). Thus other translators, bypassing the literal meaning, have
rendered it “cankers,” “corruptions,” or “taints,” the
latter being the choice of Ven. Nanamoli. The three taints mentioned
in the suttas are virtual synonyms for craving for sensual pleasures,
craving for being, and the ignorance that appears at the head of the
formula for dependent origination. When the disciple’s mind has
been liberated from the taints by the completion of the path of
arahantship, he reviews his newly won freedom and roars his lion’s
roar: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had
to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of
being.”</P>
<H3 >APPROACHES TO MEDITATION</H3>
<P  >The
methods of meditation taught by the Buddha in the Pali Canon fall
into two broad systems. One is the development of serenity (samatha),
which aims at concentration (samadhi); the other is the development
of insight (vipassana), which aims at understanding or wisdom
(panna). In the Buddha’s system of mental training the role of
serenity is subordinated to that of insight because the latter is the
crucial instrument needed to uproot the ignorance at the bottom of
samsaric bondage. The attainments possible through serenity
meditation were known to Indian contemplatives long before the advent
of the Buddha. The Buddha himself mastered the two highest stages
under his early teachers but found that they only led to higher
planes of rebirth, not to genuine enlightenment (MN 26.15-16).
However, because the unification of mind induced by the practice of
concentration contributes to clear understanding, the Buddha
incorporated the techniques of serenity meditation and the resulting
levels of absorption into his own system, treating them as a
foundation and preparation for insight and as a “pleasant abiding
here and now.”</P>
<P  >The
attainments reached by the practice of serenity meditation are, as
mentioned in the preceding section, the eight absorptions - the four
jhanas and the four immaterial states - each of which serves as the
basis for the next. Strangely, the suttas do not explicitly prescribe
specific meditation subjects as the means for attaining the jhanas,
but the commentarial literature such as the Visuddhimagga enables us
to make the connections. Among the meditation topics enumerated in
the suttas, eight of the ten kasinas (MN 77.24) are<SPAN LANG="en-GB">
recognised</SPAN> as suitable for attaining all four jhanas, the last
two being the respective supports for the first two immaterial
attainments. The eight bases for transcendence seem to be a more
finely differentiated treatment of meditation on the<SPAN LANG="en-GB">
colour</SPAN> kasinas, as are the first three of the eight
liberations (MN 77.22-23). Mindfulness of breathing, to which the
Buddha devotes an entire sutta (MN 118), provides an ever accessible
meditation subject that can be pursued through all four jhanas and
also used to develop insight. Another method for attaining the jhanas
mentioned in the suttas is the four divine abodes <SPAN LANG="en-GB">(brahmavihara</SPAN>)
- boundless loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy (i.e.,
gladness at others’ success), and equanimity (MN 7, MN 40, etc.).
Tradition holds the first three to be capable of leading to the three
lower jhanas, the last of inducing the fourth jhana. The immaterial
attainments are to be reached by fixing the mind on the specific
object of each attainment - infinite space, infinite consciousness,
nothingness, and the state that can only be described as neither
percipient nor as non-percipient.</P>
<P  >Whereas
in serenity meditation the meditator attempts to focus upon a single
uniform object abstracted from actual experience, in insight
meditation the endeavour is made to contemplate, from a position of
detached observation, the ever-shifting flux of experience itself in
order to penetrate through to the essential nature of bodily and
mental phenomena. The Buddha teaches that the craving and clinging
that hold us in bondage are sustained by a network of “conceivings”
(mannita) - deluded views, conceits, and suppositions that the mind
fabricates by an internal process of mental commentary or
“proliferation” (papanca) and then projects out upon the world,
taking them to possess objective validity. The task of insight
meditation is to sever our attachments by enabling us to pierce
through this net of conceptual projections in order to see things as
they really are. To see things as they really are means to see them
in terms of the three characteristics - as impermanent, as painful or
suffering, and as not self. Since the three characteristics are
closely interlinked, any one of them can be made the main portal for
entering the domain of insight, but the Buddha’s usual approach is
to show all three together - impermanence implying suffering and the
two in conjunction implying the absence of self. When the noble
disciple sees all the factors of being as stamped with these three
marks, he no longer identifies with them, no longer appropriates them
by taking them to be mine, I, or self. Seeing thus, he becomes
disenchanted with all formations. When he becomes disenchanted, his
lust and attachment fade away and his mind is liberated from the
taints.</P>
<P  >Instructions
for the development of insight in the Majjhima Nikaya, though
concise, are many and diverse. The single most important lesson on
the practice conducing to insight is the Satipatthana Sutta, the
Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness (MN 10; also found in the
Digha Nikaya with an amplified section on the Four Noble Truths). The
sutta sets forth a comprehensive system called satipatthana designed
to train the mind to see with microscopic precision the true nature
of the body, feelings, states of mind, and mental objects. The system
is sometimes taken to be the paradigm for the practice of “bare
insight” - the direct contemplation of mental and bodily phenomena
without a prior foundation of jhana - and, while several exercises
described in the sutta can also lead to the jhanas, the arousing of
insight is clearly the intent of the method.</P>
<P  >Other
suttas in the Majjhima Nikaya describe approaches to developing
insight that either elaborate upon the satipatthana contemplations or
reach them from a different starting point. Thus MN 118 shows how the
practice of mindfulness of breathing fulfils all four foundations of
mindfulness, not the first alone as shown in MN 10. Several suttas -
MN 28, MN 62, MN 140 - present more detailed instructions on the
contemplation of the elements. MN 37, MN 74, and MN 140 contain
illuminating passages on the contemplation of feeling. In some suttas
the Buddha uses the five aggregates as the groundwork for insight
contemplation (e.g., MN 22, MN 109); in some, the six sense bases
(e.g., MN 137, MN 148, MN 149); in some, the two combined (MN 147).
MN 112 has sections dealing with insight based on the five
aggregates, the six elements, and the six sense bases, and as
resulting from the gradual training. MN 52 and MN 64 show that
insight can also be aroused with the jhanas, the immaterial
attainments, and the divine abodes as its objects: the disciple
enters any of these states and contemplates its constituent factors
as subject to the three characteristics.</P>
<P  >Several
sequences of meditative states mentioned in the Majjhima culminate in
an attainment called the cessation of perception and feeling
(sannavedayitanirodha). Although this state always follows the last
immaterial attainment, it is not, as may be supposed, merely one
higher step in the scale of concentration. Strictly speaking, the
attainment of cessation pertains neither to serenity nor to insight.
It is a state reached by the combined powers of serenity and insight
in which all mental processes are temporarily suspended. The
attainment is said to be accessible only to non-returners and
arahants who have also mastered the jhanas and immaterial states.
Detailed canonical discussions of it are found in MN 43 and MN 44.</P>
<H3 >THE FOUR PLANES OF LIBERATION</H3>
<P  >The
practice of the Buddhist path evolves in two distinct stages, a
mundane (lokiya) or preparatory stage and a supramundane (lokuttara)
or consummate stage. The mundane path is developed when the disciple
undertakes the gradual training in virtue, concentration, and wisdom.
This reaches its peak in the practice of insight meditation, which
deepens direct experience of the three characteristics of existence.
When the practitioner’s faculties have arrived at an adequate
degree of maturity, the mundane path gives birth to the supramundane
path, so called because it leads directly and infallibly out of
(uttara) the world (loka) comprising the three realms of existence to
the attainment of “the deathless element,” Nibbana.</P>
<P  >Progress
along the supramundane path is marked by four major breakthroughs,
each of which ushers the disciple through two subordinate phases
called the path (magga) and its fruit (phala). The phase of path has
the special function of eliminating a determinate number of
defilements to which it is directly opposed, the mental impediments
that hold us in bondage to the round of rebirths. When the work of
the path has been completed, the disciple realises its corresponding
fruit, the degree of liberation made accessible by that particular
path. The canonical formula of homage to the Sangha refers obliquely
to these four planes of liberation - each with its phase of path and
fruit - when it extols the Blessed One’s community of noble
disciples as comprising “the four pairs of persons, the eight types
of individuals” (MN 7.7). These four pairs are obtained by taking,
for each stage, the one who has entered upon the way to realisation
of the fruit and the one who has attained the fruit.</P>
<P  >In
the suttas the Buddha highlights the specific characteristics of each
supramundane stage in two ways: by mentioning the defilements that
are abandoned on each plane and the consequences its attainment bears
on the process of rebirth (see, e.g., MN 6.11-13,19; MN 22.42-45,
etc.). He handles the elimination of the defilements by classifying
these into a tenfold group called the ten fetters (samyojana). The
disciple enters upon the first supramundane path either as a
Dhamma-follower (dhammanusarin) or as a faith-follower
(saddhanusarin); the former is one in whom wisdom is the dominant
faculty, the latter one who progresses by the impetus of faith. This
path, the path of stream-entry, has the task of eradicating the
grossest three fetters: personality view, i.e., the view of a self
among the five aggregates; doubt in the Buddha and his teaching; and
adherence to external rules and observances, either ritualistic or
ascetic, in the belief that they can bring purification. When the
disciple realises the fruit of this path he becomes a stream-enterer
(sotapanna), who has entered the “stream” of the Noble Eightfold
Path that will carry him irreversibly to Nibbana. The stream-enterer
is bound to reach final liberation in a maximum of seven more births,
which all occur either in the human world or in the heavenly realms.</P>
<P  >The
second supramundane path attenuates to a still greater degree the
root defilements of lust, hatred, and delusion, though without yet
eradicating them. On realising the fruit of this path the disciple
becomes a once-returner (sakadagamin), who is due to return to this
world (i.e., the sense-sphere realm) only one more time and then make
an end of suffering. The third path eradicates the next two fetters,
sensual desire and ill will; it issues in the fruit of the
non-returner (anagamin), who is due to reappear by spontaneous birth
in one of the special celestial realms called the Pure Abodes, and
there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world.</P>
<P  >The
fourth and last supramundane path is the path of arahantship. This
path eradicates the five higher fetters: desire for rebirth in the
fine-material realm and in the immaterial realm, conceit,
restlessness, and ignorance. By realisation of the fruit of this path
the practitioner becomes an arahant, a fully liberated one, who “here
and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and
deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the
taints.” The arahant will be discussed further in the next section.</P>
<P  >The
commentaries (often referred to in the notes to this translation)
develop an interpretation of the paths and fruits based upon the
systemisation of the Buddha’s teachings known as the Abhidhamma.
Drawing upon the Abhidhamma depiction of the mind as a sequence of
discrete momentary acts of consciousness, called cittas, the
commentaries understand each supramundane path to be a single
occasion of consciousness arising at the climax of a series of
insights into the Dhamma. Each of the four momentary path cittas
eliminates its own fixed set of defilements, to be followed
immediately by its fruition, which consists of a string of momentary
cittas that enjoy the bliss of Nibbana made accessible by the
breakthrough of the path. Though this conception of the paths and
fruits is regularly employed by the commentators as an hermeneutical
tool for interpreting the suttas, it is not explicitly formulated as
such in the old Nikayas and at times there even appears to be a
tension between the two (for example, in the passage at MN 142.5
describing the four persons on the path as distinct recipients of
offerings).</P>
<H3 >THE ARAHANT</H3>
<P  >The
ideal figure of the Majjhima Nikaya, as of the Pali Canon as a whole,
is the arahant. The word “arahant” itself derives from a root
meaning “to be worthy.” Ven. Nanamoli renders it “accomplished”
and “Accomplished One” when it is used as an epithet of the
Buddha, probably to be consistent with his practice of translating
all the Buddha’s epithets. In its other occurrences he leaves it
untranslated. The word seems to have been of pre-Buddhist coinage but
was taken over by the Buddha to designate the individual who has
reached the final fruit of the path.</P>
<P  >The
suttas employ a stock description of the arahant that summarises his
accomplishments: he is “one with taints destroyed, who has lived
the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden,
reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is
completely liberated through final knowledge” (MN 1.51, etc.).
Variant descriptions emphasise different aspects of the arahant’s
attainment. Thus one sutta offers a series of metaphorical epithets
that the Buddha himself interprets as representing the arahant’s
abandoning of ignorance, craving, and conceit, his eradication of
fetters, and his freedom from the round of births (MN 22.30-35).
Elsewhere the Buddha ascribes a different set of epithets to the
arahant - several of brahmanical currency - deriving these terms by
imaginative etymology from the arahant’s elimination of all evil
unwholesome states (MN 39.22-29).</P>
<P  >The
Majjhima records differences of type among the arahants, which are
ascribed to the diversity in their faculties. In MN 70 the Buddha
introduces a basic distinction between those arahants who are
“liberated-in-both-ways” and those who are “liberated-by-wisdom”:
whereas the former are capable of abiding in the immaterial
attainments, the latter lack that capacity. Arahants are further
distinguished as those who possess, besides the knowledge of the
destruction of the taints necessary to all arahants, all three of the
true knowledges and all six of the direct knowledges. In MN 108 the
venerable Ananda indicates that those arahants who possessed the six
direct knowledges were accorded special veneration and authority in
the Sangha following the Buddha’s passing away.</P>
<P  >Beneath
these incidental differences, however, all arahants alike share the
same essential accomplishments - the destruction of all defilements
and the freedom from future rebirths. They possess three
unsurpassable qualities - unsurpassable vision, unsurpassable
practice of the way, and unsurpassable deliverance (MN 35.26). They
are endowed with the ten factors of one beyond training - the eight
factors of the Noble Eightfold Path augmented by right knowledge and
right deliverance (MN 65.34, MN 78.14). They possess the four
foundations - the foundations of wisdom, of truth, of relinquishment,
and of peace (MN 140.11). And by the eradication of lust, hate, and
delusion all arahants have access to a unique meditative attainment
called the fruition attainment of arahantship, described as the
unshakeable deliverance of mind, the immeasurable deliverance of
mind, the void deliverance of mind, the deliverance of mind through
nothingness, and the signless deliverance of mind (MN 43.35-37).</P>
<H3 >KAMMA AND REBIRTH</H3>
<P  >According
to the Buddha’s teaching, all beings except the arahants are
subject to “renewal of being in the future” (punabbhava), that
is, to rebirth. Rebirth, in the Buddhist conception, is not the
transmigration of a self or soul but the continuation of a process, a
flux of becoming in which successive lives are linked together by
causal transmission of influence rather than by substantial identity.
The basic causal pattern underlying the process is that defined by
the teaching of dependent origination (see above, pp. 30-31), which
also demonstrates how rebirth is possible without a reincarnating
self.</P>
<P  >The
process of rebirth, the Buddha teaches, exhibits a definite
lawfulness essentially ethical in character. This ethical character
is established by the fundamental dynamism that determines the states
into which beings are reborn and the circumstances they encounter in
the course of their lives. That dynamism is kamma, volitional action
of body, speech, and mind. Those beings who engage in bad actions -
actions motivated by the three unwholesome roots of greed, hate, and
delusion - generate unwholesome kamma that leads them to rebirth into
lower states of existence and, if it ripens in the human world,
brings them pain and misfortune. Those beings who engage in good
actions - actions motivated by the three wholesome roots of
non-greed, non-hate, and non-delusion - generate wholesome kamma that
leads them to higher states of existence and ripens in the human
world as pleasure and good fortune. Because the deeds a person
performs in the course of a single life can be extremely varied, the
type of rebirth that lies ahead of him can be very unpredictable, as
the Buddha shows in MN 136. But despite this empirical variability,
an invariable law governs the direct relationship between types of
actions and the types of results they yield, the basic correlations
being sketched by the Buddha in MN 57 and laid out in greater detail
in MN 135.</P>
<P  >In
several suttas of the Majjhima Nikaya the Buddha refers to various
planes of existence into which rebirth can occur and he also gives
some indication of the types of kamma that lead to those planes. This
cosmological typography is not, from the Buddhist standpoint, the
product of conjecture or fantasy but a matter directly known to the
Buddha through his “Tathagata’s powers of knowledge” (MN
12.36); to some extent the process is also verifiable by those who
gain the divine eye (e.g., MN 39.20). A brief overview may be given
here of the planes of rebirth recognised in Buddhist cosmology and of
their kammic antecedents, as systematised in the developed Theravada
tradition.</P>
<P  >The
Buddhist cosmos is divided into three broad realms - the sense-sphere
realm, the fine-material realm, and the immaterial realm. Each of
these comprises a range of subsidiary planes, amounting to a total of
thirty-one planes of existence.</P>
<P  >The
sense-sphere realm, so called because sensual desire predominates
there, consists of eleven planes divided into two groups, the bad
destinations and the good destinations. The bad destinations or
“states of deprivation” (apaya) are four in number: the hells,
which are states of intense torment as described in MN 129 and MN
130; the animal kingdom; the sphere of ghosts (peta), beings
afflicted with incessant hunger and thirst; and the sphere of titans
(asura), beings involved in constant combat (not mentioned as a
separate plane in the Majjhima). The courses of kamma leading to
rebirth into these planes are classified into a set of ten - three of
body, four of speech, and three of mind. These are enumerated briefly
at MN 9.4 and explicated in MN 41. Gradations in the gravity of the
evil intentions responsible for these deeds account for specific
differences in the mode of rebirth resulting from such actions.</P>
<P  >The
good destinations in the sense-sphere realm are the human world and
the heavenly planes. The latter are sixfold: the gods under the Four
Great Kings; the gods of the Thirty-three (tavatimsa), who are
presided over by Sakka, a Buddhist metamorphosis of Indra, depicted
as a devotee of the Buddha, faithful, but prone to negligence (MN
37); the Yama gods; the gods of the Tusita heaven, the abode of the
Bodhisatta before his final birth (MN 123); the gods who delight in
creating; and the gods who wield power over others’ creations. The
last is said to be the abode of Mara, the Tempter in Buddhism, who
besides being a symbol for Desire and Death, is also regarded as a
powerful deity with evil designs, keen to prevent beings from
escaping the net of samsara. The kammic cause for rebirth into the
good destinations of the sense-sphere realm is the practice of the
ten courses of wholesome action, defined at MN 9.8 and in MN 41.</P>
<P  >In
the fine-material realm the grosser types of matter are absent and
the bliss, power, luminosity, and vitality of its denizens are far
superior to those in the sense-sphere realm. The fine-material realm
consists of sixteen planes, which are the objective counterparts of
the four jhanas. Attainment of the first jhana leads to rebirth among
Brahma’s Assembly, the Ministers of Brahma and the Maha Brahmas,
according to whether it is developed to an inferior, middling, or
superior degree. Baka the Brahma (MN 49) and Brahma Sahampati (MN 26,
MN 67) seem to be residents of the last-named plane. The suttas
mention especially the divine abodes as the path to the company of
Brahma (MN 99.24-27). Attainment of the second jhana in the same
three degrees leads respectively to rebirth among the gods of Limited
Radiance, of Immeasurable Radiance, and of Streaming Radiance; the
third jhana to rebirth among the gods of Limited Glory, of
Immeasurable Glory, and of Refulgent Glory. The fourth jhana
ordinarily leads to rebirth among the gods of Great Fruit, but if it
is developed with a desire to attain an insentient mode of existence,
it will conduce to rebirth among the nonpercipient beings, for whom
consciousness is temporarily suspended. The fine-material realm also
contains five special planes that are exclusively for the rebirth of
non-returners. These are the Pure Abodes - the Aviha, the Atappa, the
Sudassa, the Sudass3, and the Akanittha. In each of these planes in
the fine material realm the lifespan is said to be of enormous
duration and to increase significantly in each higher plane.</P>
<P  >The
third realm of being is the immaterial realm, where matter has become
non-existent and only mental processes exist. This realm consists of
four planes, which are the objective counterparts of the four
immaterial meditative attainments, from which they result and whose
names they share: the bases of infinite space, infinite
consciousness, nothingness, and
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. The lifespans ascribed to them
are respectively 20,000; 40,000; 60,000; and 84,000 great aeons.</P>
<P  >In
Buddhist cosmology existence in every realm, being the product of a
kamma with a finite potency, is necessarily impermanent. Beings take
rebirth in accordance with their deeds, experience the good or bad
results, and then, when the generative kamma has spent its force,
they pass away to take rebirth elsewhere as determined by still
another kamma that has found the opportunity to ripen. Hence the
torments of hell as well as the bliss of heaven, no matter how long
they may last, are bound to pass. For this reason the Buddha does not
locate the final goal of his teaching anywhere within the conditioned
world. He guides those whose spiritual faculties are still tender to
aspire for a heavenly rebirth and teaches them the lines of conduct
that conduce to the fulfilment of their aspirations (MN 41, MN 120).
But for those whose faculties are mature and who can grasp the
unsatisfactory nature of everything conditioned, he urges determined
effort to put an end to wandering in samsara and to reach Nibbana,
which transcends all planes of being.</P>
<H3 >THE BUDDHA AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES</H3>
<P  >The
Middle Country of India in which the Buddha lived and taught in the
fifth century B.C. teemed with a luxuriant variety of religious and
philosophical beliefs propagated by teachers equally varied in their
ways of life. The main division was into the brahmins and the
non-brahmanic ascetics, the samanas or “recluses.” The brahmins
were the hereditary priesthood of India, the custodians of the
ancient orthodoxy. They accepted the authority of the Vedas, which
they studied, chanted at countless rituals, sacrifices, and
ceremonies, and turned to as the source of their philosophical
speculations. Thus they are characterised in the suttas as
traditionalists (anussavika), who teach their doctrines on the basis
of oral tradition (MN 100.7). The Pali Canon generally depicts them
as living a comfortably settled life, as marrying and begetting
progeny, and in some cases as enjoying royal patronage. The more
learned among them gathered a company of students - all necessarily
of brahmin birth - to whom they taught the Vedic hymns.</P>
<P  >The
samanas, on the other hand, did not accept the authority of the
Vedas, for which reason from the perspective of the brahmins they
stood in the ranks of heterodoxy. They were usually celibate, lived a
life of mendicancy, and acquired their status by voluntary
renunciation rather than by birth. The samanas roamed the Indian
countryside sometimes in company, sometimes as solitaries, preaching
their doctrines to the populace, debating with other ascetics,
engaging in their spiritual practices, which often involved severe
austerities (see MN 51.8). Some teachers in the samana camp taught
entirely on the basis of reasoning and speculation, while others
taught on the basis of their experiences in meditation. The Buddha
placed himself among the latter, as one who teaches a Dhamma that he
has directly known for himself (MN 100.7).</P>
<P  >The
Buddha’s encounters with brahmins were usually friendly, their
conversations marked by courtesy and mutual regard. Several suttas in
the Majjhima Nikaya concern the brahmins’ claim to superiority over
those in other social classes. In the Buddha’s age the caste system
was only beginning to take shape in northeast India and had not yet
spawned the countless subdivisions and rigid regulations that were to
manacle Indian society through the centuries. Society was divided
into four broad social classes: the brahmins, who performed the
priestly functions; the khattiyas, the nobles, warriors, and
administrators; the vessas, the merchants and agriculturalists; and
the suddas, the menials and serfs. From the Pali suttas it appears
that the brahmins, while vested with authority in religious matters,
had not yet risen to the position of unchallengeable hegemony they
were to gain after the promulgation of the Laws of Manu. They had,
however, already embarked on their drive for domination and did so by
propagating the thesis that brahmins are the highest caste, the
fairest caste, the divinely blessed offspring of Brahma who are alone
capable of purification. Anxiety that this claim of the brahmins
might actually be true seems to have spread among the royalty, who
must have been fearful of the threat it posed to their own power (see
MN 84.4, MN 90.9-10).</P>
<P  >Contrary
to certain popular notions, the Buddha did not explicitly repudiate
the class divisions of Indian society or appeal for the abolition of
this social system. Within the Sangha, however, all caste
distinctions were abrogated from the moment of ordination.</P>
<P  >Thus
people from any of the four castes who went forth under the Buddha
renounced their class titles and prerogatives and instead became
known simply as disciples of the Sakyan son (see Ud 5:5/55). Whenever
the Buddha or his disciples were confronted with the brahmins’
claim to superiority, they argued vigorously against them,
maintaining that all such claims were groundless. Purification, they
contended, was the result of conduct, not of birth, and was thus
accessible to those of all four castes (MN 40.13-14, MN 84, MN 90.12,
MN 93). The Buddha even stripped the term “brahmin” of its
hereditary accretions, and hearkening back to its original
connotation of holy man, he defined the true brahmin as the arahant
(MN 98). Those among the brahmins who were not yet hampered by class
prejudice responded appreciatively to the Buddha’s teaching. Some
of the most eminent brahmins of the time, in whom there still burned
the ancient Vedic yearning for light, knowledge, and truth,
recognised in the Buddha the All-Enlightened One for whom they longed
and declared themselves his disciples (see especially MN 91.34).
Several even renounced their class privileges and with their retinues
entered the Sangha (MN 7.22, MN 92.15-24).</P>
<P  >The
samanas were a” much more diversified group which, lacking a common
scriptural authority, promulgated a plethora of philosophical
doctrines ranging from the diabolical to the superdivine. The Pali
Canon frequently mentions six teachers in particular as
contemporaries of the Buddha, and as they are each described as “the
head of an order … regarded by many as a saint” (MN 77.5), they
must have been quite influential at the time. The Majjhima Nikaya
mentions both the set of six and, separately, states their individual
doctrines; it does not, however, correlate the names with the
doctrines. The connections between names and doctrines are made in
the Samannaphala Sutta of the Digha Nikaya.</P>
<P  >Purana
Kassapa, who is always mentioned first in the list, taught a doctrine
of inaction (akiriyavada) that denied the validity of moral
distinctions (MN 60.13, MN 76.10). Makkhali Gosala was the leader of
the sect known as the Ajivakas (or Ajivikas), which survived in India
down into the medieval period. He taught a doctrine of fatalism that
denied causality (ahetukavada) and claimed that the entire cosmic
process is rigidly controlled by a principle called fate or destiny
(niyati); beings have no volitional control over their actions but
move helplessly caught in the grip of fate (MN 60.21, MN 76.13).
Ajita Kesakambalin was a moral nihilist (natthikavada) who propounded
a materialist philosophy that rejected the existence of an afterlife
and kammic retribution (MN 60.5, MN 76.7); his doctrine is always
cited by the Buddha as the paradigmatic instance of wrong view among
the unwholesome courses of action. Pakudha Kaccayana advocated an
atomism on the basis of which he repudiated the basic tenets of
morality (MN 76.16). Sanjaya Belatthiputta, a sceptic, refused to
take a stand on the crucial moral and philosophical issues of the
day, probably claiming that such knowledge was beyond our capacity
for verification (MN 76.30). The sixth teacher, the Nigantha
Nataputta, is identified with Mahavira, the historical progenitor of
Jainism. He taught that there exists a plurality of monadic souls
entrapped in matter by the bonds of past kamma and that the soul is
to be liberated by exhausting its kammic bonds through the practice
of severe self-mortification.</P>
<P  >Whereas
the Pali suttas are generally cordial but critical towards the
brahmins, they are trenchant in their rejection of the rival
doctrines of the samanas. In one sutta (MN,60) the Buddha contends
that the firm adoption of any of the first three doctrines (and by
implication the fourth) entails a chain of unwholesome states
generating evil kamma strong enough to bring a descent into the lower
realms. Similarly the venerable Ananda describes these views as four
“negations of the holy life” (MN 76). The scepticism of Sanjaya,
while not regarded as so pernicious, is taken as an indication of its
proponent’s dullness and confusion; it is described as
“eel-wriggling” (amaravikkhepa) because of its evasiveness and
classified among the types of holy life that are without consolation
(MN 76.30-31). The Jain doctrine, though sharing certain similarities
with the Buddha’s teaching, was held to be sufficiently mistaken in
basic assumptions as to call for refutation, which the Buddha
undertook on several occasions (MN 14, MN 56, MN 101). The
repudiation of these erroneous views was seen, from the Buddhist
perspective, to be a necessary measure not only to sound a clear
warning against tenets that were spiritually detrimental, but also to
cut away the obstacles against the acceptance of right view, which as
the forerunner of the Buddha’s path (MN 117.4) was a prerequisite
to progress along the road to final deliverance.</P>
<H3 >TECHNICAL NOTES</H3>
<P  >There
remain to be discussed only a few technical points concerning this
translation: first a general problem inevitably facing any translator
from the Pali Canon, then certain changes that have been made in Ven.
Nanamoli’s renderings of important doctrinal terms.</P>
<H3 >THE REPETITIONS</H3>
<P  >Readers
of Pali suttas, particularly in the original language, will
immediately be struck by the frequency and length of the repetitive
passages. The repetitions, if examined, will be found to be of
different kinds and thus probably stem from different sources. We may
consider three main types.</P>
<P  >First
are the narrative repetitions within a single sutta as well as the
repetition of statements in ordinary conversation. These doubtlessly
originate from the method of oral transmission by which the suttas
were preserved for the first four centuries of their existence, such
repetition serving as a useful mnemonic device to ensure that details
would not be lost. In this translation these repetitions have usually
been bridged over with ellipsis points and occasionally the liberty
was taken of contracting them.</P>
<P  >A
second type of repetition stems from the use of stock formulas to
describe fixed sets of doctrinal categories or aspects of the
training. A common example of this is the formulas for the four
jhanas and the three true knowledges. These formulas were almost
certainly part of the Buddha’s repertory of instructions, employed
by him in the countless discourses he gave during his forty-five
years’ ministry in order to preserve the unity and consistency of
his teaching. Here the shorter stereotyped formulas have generally
been allowed to stand except when they play a subordinate role to a
larger theme, in which case only the main clauses have been retained;
an example is the treatment of the jhana formula at MN 53.18. The
longer formulas that appear very often have been abridged, with
references usually given to the passages where they appear in full;
examples are the treatment of the first two true knowledges at MN
27.23-24 and of the gradual training at MN 38.31-38.</P>
<P  >A
third type of repetition stems from the Buddha’s application of an
identical method of exposition to a series of doctrinal terms
belonging to a fixed set. Examples are the formula for insight that
is attached to each of the exercises in the Satipatthana Sutta (MN
10.5), and the exposition on the three characteristics applied to
each of the five aggregates (MN 22.26). These repetitions, contrary
to modernistic suppositions, were very likely integral to the
Buddha’s own pedagogical method and served to drive home the points
he wanted to convey. We can well imagine that such repetitions,
delivered by a fully enlightened teacher to those earnestly striving
for awakening, must have sunk down deep into the minds of those who
heard them and in many cases triggered off a glimpse of the truth. In
the translation this type of repetition has usually been handled by
repeating the method of exposition only for the first and last terms
in the set - as is often done in the Pali editions of the texts -
except when the method of exposition is especially long (as at MN
118.37-39), in which case it is shown in full only for the first term
and in much abbreviated form for the rest. Those who read the suttas
as an exercise in contemplation, and not merely for information, may
try mentally filling in the entire sequence and exploring its range
of implications.</P>
<H3 >DHAMMA</H3>
<P  >In
his later translations Ven. Nanamoli appears to have set himself two
goals: to render virtually every Pali word into English (arahant and
bodhisatta are rare exceptions); and to do so in obedience to a very
rigorous standard of consistency. In effect the principle that guided
his work was: one Pali word, one corresponding English word. This
principle he also applied to his treatment of the multiplex word
dhamma, of which he wrote elsewhere that “the need for unity in the
rendering is so great as to be almost desperate” (Minor Readings
and Illustrator, p. 331). He chose as his root rendering the word
“idea,” which he attempted to deploy for the Pali word in all its
diverse occurrences. Even when dhamma is used in the suttas to
signify the Buddha’s teaching, he still remained faithful to his
choice by translating it “the True Idea.”</P>
<P  >Needless
to say, this experiment was not successful. Recognising this, Ven.
Khantipalo, in his edition of the ninety suttas, opted instead to
retain the Pali word in most of its occurrences.</P>
<P  >This
decision, however, seems to have been unnecessary when the
relinquishing of the demand for strict consistency allows for smooth
and reliable translation without loss of meaning. While the many
different uses of the Pali word dhamma may originally have had some
underlying connection of meaning, by the time of the Pali Canon such
connection had already receded so far into the background as to be
virtually irrelevant to the understanding of the texts. The
commentaries ascribe at least ten different contextual meanings to
the word as it occurs in the Canon and they do not try to read any
philosophical significance into this variability of application. The
goal of lucid translation therefore seems to require that the word be
rendered differently according to its context, which generally makes
the intended meaning clear.</P>
<P  >In
revising Ven. Nanamoli’s translation I have retained the Pali word
Mamma only when it refers to the Buddha’s teaching, or in several
cases to a rival teaching with which the Buddha’s is contrasted (as
at MN 11.13 and MN 104.2). In its other uses the context has been
allowed to decide the rendering. Thus when dhamma occurs in the
plural as a general ontological reference term it has been rendered
“things” (as at MN 1.2 and MN 2.5). When it acquires a more
technical nuance, in the sense either of the phenomena of existence
or of mental constituents, it has been rendered “states” (as at
MN 64.9 and MN 111.4). This term, however, must be divested of its
overtone of staticity, dhammas being events within a dynamic process,
and it must also not be taken to refer to some persisting entity that
undergoes the states, entities themselves being nothing but connected
series of dhammas. The last two meanings of dhamma are not always
separable in the texts and sometimes naturalness of English diction
had to be used as the factor for deciding which should be selected.</P>
<P  >As
the fourth foundation of mindfulness and as the sixth external sense
base (ayatana), dhamma has been rendered “mindobjects” (even here
“ideas” is too narrow). In still other contexts it has been
rendered as factors (MN 10.5), qualities (MN 15.3, MN 48.6) and
teachings (MN 46.2, MN 47.3). When used as a suffix it acquires the
idiomatic sense of “to be subject to” and so it has been
translated, e.g., viparinamadhamma as “subject to change.”</P>
<H4 >SANKHARA</H4>
<P  >Although
this word as used in the suttas has different specific references in
different contexts, unlike dhamma it retains enough unity of meaning
to permit, with rare exceptions, a uniform rendering. The problem,
however, is to decide which of the many proposed renderings is the
most adequate, or, if none are found fitting, to coin a new one that
is.</P>
<P  >The
root idea suggested by the word sankhara is “making together.”
The Pali commentators explain that the word allows for both an active
and a passive sense. Thus the sankharas are either factors (or
forces) that function together in producing an effect, or they are
the things that are produced by a combination of co-operating
factors. In his translation of the</P>
<P  >Visuddhimagga
Ven. Nanamoli had rendered sankharas as “formations,” a rendering
favoured by many other translators. In his later translation scheme
he had experimented with rendering it as “determinations” and had
attempted to incorporate that new choice into his manuscript of the
Majjhima. In editing the manuscript Ven. Khantipalo chose to return
to the translator’s earlier and better known “formations,” and
in this edition I have followed suit. Though this word has the
disadvantage of accentuating the passive aspect of sankharas, it
avoids the problems into which “determinations” runs and seems
colourless enough to take on the meaning determined by the context.</P>
<P  >The
word sankhara occurs in four major contexts in the Pali suttas: (1)
As the second factor in the formula of dependent origination it is
used to mean volitional actions, suggesting their active role of
generating results in the process of rebirth. (2) As the fourth of
the five aggregates the sankharas comprise all the mental factors not
included in the other three mental aggregates; this group is probably
assigned the name sankharakkhandha after its chief member, volition
(cetana), which is responsible for forming all the other aggregates.
(3) Sankhara is also used in a very comprehensive sense to signify
everything produced by conditions. In this sense it comprises all
five aggregates (as at MN 35.4 and MN 115.12). Here the word bears
the passive sense, being explained by the commentators as
sankhatasankhara, “formations consisting in the conditioned.”
This usage comes close in meaning to the ontological use of dhamma,
except that the latter is wider in range since it includes the
unconditioned element Nibbana and concepts (pannatti), both of which
are excluded from sankhara. (4) In still another context the word
sankhara is used in relation to kaya, vaca and citta - body, speech,
and mind - to mean the bodily formation, which is in-and-out
breathing; the verbal formation, which is applied thought and
sustained thought; and the mental formation, which is perception and
feeling. The first and third are things that are dependent
respectively upon the body and the mind, the second the things that
activate speech. This triad is discussed at MN 44.13-15.</P>
<P  >Sankhara
is also employed outside these major contexts, and in one such case
Ven. Nanamoli’s sense of “determination” has been retained.
This is where it occurs in the compound padhanasankhara, which has
been rendered “determined striving” (as at MN 16.26). The rare
and involved idiom, sankharam padahati, has similarly been rendered
“he strives with determination” (MN 101.23). In another case (MN
120), following the commentarial gloss, sankhara is rendered
“aspiration.”</P>
<H3 >NAMARUPA</H3>
<P  >Ven.
Nanamoli had translated this compound literally as “name-and-form.”
In this edition the compound has been changed back to the rendering
used in his translation of the Visuddhimagga,
“mentality-materiality,” though with regret that this cumbersome
Latinate expression lacks the concision and punch of “name-and-form.”
The word nama originally meant “name,” but in the Pali suttas it
is used in this compound as a collective term for the mental factors
associated with consciousness, as will be seen in the definition at
MN 9.54. The commentaries explain nama here as deriving from the word
namati, to bend, and as being applied to the mental factors because
they “bend” towards the object in the act of cognizing it. Rupa
is used in two major contexts in the suttas: as the first of the five
aggregates and as the specific object of eye-consciousness. The
former is a broader category that includes the latter as one among
many other species of rupa. Ven. Nanamoli, aiming at consistency in
his manuscript translation, had used “form” for rupa as visible
object (in preference to the “visible-datum” used in his earlier
translation scheme). But when rupa is used to signify the first of
the five aggregates, it has been changed to “material form.” This
rendering should indicate more precisely the meaning of rupa in that
context while preserving the connection with rupa as visible object.
Occasionally in the texts the word seems to straddle both meaning
without allowing an exclusive delimitation, as in the context of
certain meditative attainments such as the first two liberations (MN
77.22).</P>
<H3 >BRAHMA</H3>
<P  >The
word brahma provided Ven. Nanamoli with another challenge to his
endeavour to achieve complete consistency. The word itself, going
back to the Vedic period, originally meant holy power, the sacred
power that sustains the cosmos and that was contacted through the
prayers and rituals of the Vedas. Though the word retained its
significance of “holy” or “sacred,” by the Buddha’s time it
had undergone two distinct lines of development. One culminated in
the conception of Brahman (neuter) as an impersonal absolute reality
hidden behind and manifesting through the changing phenomena of the
world. This conception is the keynote of the Upanishads, but the word
brahma never appears in this sense in the Pali Canon. The other line
of development culminated in the conception of Brahma (masculine
singular) as an eternal personal God who creates and regulates the
world. This conception was held by the brahmins as depicted in the
Pali suttas. The Buddhists themselves asserted that Brahma was not a
single creator God but a collective name for several classes of high
deities whose chiefs, forgetting that they are still transient beings
in the grip of kamma, were prone to imagine themselves to be the
omnipotent everlasting creator (see MN 49).</P>
<P  >Ven.
Nanamoli attempted to fulfil his guideline of consistency by
rendering the word brahma in its various occurrences by “divine”
or its cognates. Thus Brahma the deity was rendered “the Divinity,”
brahmana (= brahmin) was rendered “divine” (as a noun meaning a
priestly theologian), and the expression brahmacariya, in which
brahma functions as an adjective, was rendered “the Life Divine.”
The result of this experiment was again the sacrifice of clarity for
the sake of consistency, even at the risk of generating
misunderstanding, and therefore in the revisionary process I decided
to treat these expressions in line with more conventional practices.
Thus Brahma and brahmin have been left untranslated (the latter word
is probably already more familiar to modern readers than the archaic
noun “divine”). The word brahma, as it appears in compounds, has
usually been rendered “holy” - e.g., brahmacariya as “the holy
life” except when it is used to signify total sexual abstinence, in
which case it has been rendered in accordance with its intended
meaning as “celibacy.” The word “divine” has, however, been
retained in the expression brahmavihara, rendered “divine abode”
(MN 83.6) with reference to the “immeasurable” meditations on
lovingkindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity, which
are the dwellings of the divinity Brahma (MN 55.7) and the path to
rebirth in the Brahma-world (MN 99.22).</P>
<H3 >A NOTE ON PRONUNCIATION</H3>
<P  >The
pronunciation of Pali words and names is quite easy providing the
following simple rules are heeded. Among the vowels:</P>
<P >
a i u (without stroke above) as in “but,” “pin,” “duke”;</P>
<P >
a i u (with stroke above) as in “father,” “keen,” “pool”;</P>
<P >
e and o as in “way” and “home.”</P>
<P  >Among
the consonants, g is pronounced as in “girl,” c as in “church,”
n as in “canyon.” The cerebrals - t, d, n, 1 (with dot below) -
are spoken with the tongue on the roof of the mouth; the dentals - t,
d, n, I (without dots below) - with the tongue on the upper teeth. m
(with dot above) is a nasal as in “sing.” The aspirates - kh, gh,
ch, jh, th, dh, th, dh, ph, and bh - are single consonants pronounced
with a slight outward puff of breath, e.g., th as in “Thomas”
(not as in “that”), ph as in “top hat” (not as in “phone”).
Double consonants are always enunciated separately, e.g., dd as in
“mad dog,” gg as in “big gun.”</P>
<P  >An
o and an e always carry a stress, otherwise the stress falls on a
long vowel - a, i or u (with line above) - or on a double consonant,
or on m (above dot).</P>
<H3  >MAJOR CHANGES
IN TERMINOLOGY</H3>
<P  >This
list shows the most important of the changes in Ven. Nanamoli’s
manuscript terminology that were made for this edition. Changes
marked with an asterisk were already introduced by Ven. Khantipalo in
A Treasury of the Buddha’s Words.</P>

A Summary of the 152 Suttas</H2>
<H3 >PART ONE: THE ROOT FIFTY DISCOURSES</H3>
<OL>
<LI VALUE=1><P >Malapariyaya
Sutta: The Root of All Things. The Buddha analyses the cognitive
processes of four types of individuals - the untaught ordinary
person, the disciple in higher training, the arahant, and the
Tathagata. This is one of the deepest and most difficult suttas in
the Pali Canon, and it is therefore suggested that the earnest
student read it only in a cursory manner on a first reading of the
Majjhima Nikaya, returning to it for an in-depth study after
completing the entire collection.</P>
<LI><P >Sabbasava
Sutta: All the Taints. The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus seven methods
for restraining and abandoning the taints, the fundamental
defilements that maintain bondage to the round of birth and death.</P>
<LI><P >Dhammadayada
Sutta: Heirs in Dhamma. The Buddha enjoins the bhikkhus to be heirs
in Dhamma, not heirs in material things. The venerable Sariputta
then continues on the same theme by explaining how disciples should
train themselves to become the Buddha’s heirs in Dhamma.</P>
<LI><P >Bhayabherava
Sutta: Fear and Dread. The Buddha describes to a brahmin the
qualities required of a monk who wishes to live alone in the forest.
He then relates an account of his own attempts to conquer fear when
striving for enlightenment.</P>
<LI><P >Anangana
Sutta: Without Blemishes. The venerable Sariputta gives a discourse
to the bhikkhus on the meaning of blemishes, explaining that a
bhikkhu becomes blemished when he falls under the sway of evil
wishes.</P>
<LI><P >Akankheyya
Sutta: If a Bhikkhu Should Wish. The Buddha begins by stressing the
importance of virtue as the foundation for a bhikkhu’s training;
he then goes on to enumerate the benefits that a bhikkhu can reap by
properly fulfilling the training.</P>
<LI><P >Vatthupama
Sutta: The Simile of the Cloth. With a simple simile the Buddha
illustrates the difference between a defiled mind and a pure mind.</P>
<LI><P >Sallekha
Sutta: Effacement. The Buddha rejects the view that the mere
attainment of the meditative absorptions is effacement and explains
how effacement is properly practised in his teaching.</P>
<LI><P >Sammaditthi
Sutta: Right View. A long and important discourse by the venerable
Sariputta, with separate sections on the wholesome and the
unwholesome, nutriment, the Four Noble Truths, the twelve factors of
dependent origination, and the taints.</P>
<LI><P >Satipatthana
Sutta: The Foundations of Mindfulness. This is one of the fullest
and most important suttas by the Buddha dealing with meditation,
with particular emphasis on the development of insight. The Buddha
begins by declaring the four foundations of mindfulness to be the
direct path for the realisation of Nibbana, then gives detailed
instructions on the four foundations: the contemplation of the body,
feelings, mind, and mind-objects.</P>
<LI><P >Culasthanada
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Lion’s Roar. The Buddha
declares that only in his Dispensation can the four grades of noble
individuals be found, explaining how his teaching can be
distinguished from other creeds through its unique rejection of all
doctrines of self.</P>
<LI><P >Mahasthanada
Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Lion’s Roar. The Buddha
expounds the ten powers of a Tathagata, his four kinds of
intrepidity, and other superior qualities, which entitle him to
“roar his lion’s roar in the assemblies.”</P>
<LI><P >Mahadukkhakkhandha
Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Mass of Suffering. The Buddha
explains the full understanding of sensual pleasures, material form,
and feelings; there is a long section on the dangers in sensual
pleasures.</P>
<LI><P >Culadukkhakkhandha
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Mass of Suffering. A variation
on the preceding, ending in a discussion with Jain ascetics on the
nature of pleasure and pain.</P>
<LI><P >Anumana Sutta:
Inference. The venerable Maha Moggallana enumerates the qualities
that make a bhikkhu difficult to admonish and teaches how one should
examine oneself to remove the defects in one’s character.</P>
<LI><P >Cetokhila
Sutta: The Wilderness in the Heart. The Buddha explains to the
bhikkhus the five “wildernesses in the heart” and the five
“shackles in the heart.”</P>
<LI><P >Vanapattha
Sutta: Jungle Thickets. A discourse on the conditions under which a
meditative monk should remain living in a jungle thicket and the
conditions under which he should go elsewhere.</P>
<LI><P >Madhupindika
Sutta: The Honey Ball. The Buddha utters a deep but enigmatic
statement about “the source through which perceptions and notions
tinged by mental proliferation beset a man.” This statement is
elucidated by the venerable Maha Kaccana, whose explanation is
praised by the Buddha.</P>
<LI><P >Dvedhavitakka
Sutta: Two Kinds of Thought. With reference to his own struggle for
enlightenment, the Buddha explains the way to overcome unwholesome
thoughts and replace them by wholesome thoughts.</P>

methods for dealing with the unwholesome thoughts that may arise in
the course of meditation.</P>
<LI><P >Kakacupama
Sutta: The Simile of the Saw. A discourse on the need to maintain
patience when addressed with disagreeable words.</P>
<LI><P >Alagaddupama
Sutta: The Simile of the Snake. A bhikkhu named Arittha gives rise
to a pernicious view that conduct prohibited by the Buddha is not
really an obstruction. The Buddha reprimands him and, with a series
of memorable similes, stresses the dangers in misapplying and
misrepresenting the Dhamma. The sutta culminates in one of the most
impressive disquisitions on non-self found in the Canon.</P>
<LI><P >Vammika Sutta:
The Ant-hill. A deity presents a monk with an obscure riddle, which
is unravelled for him by the Buddha.</P>
<LI><P >Rathavinita
Sutta: The Relay Chariots. The venerable Punna Mantaniputta explains
to Sariputta that the goal of the holy life, final Nibbana, is to be
reached by way of the seven stages of purification.</P>
<LI><P >Nivapa Sutta:
The Bait. The Buddha uses the analogy of deer-trappers to make known
to the bhikkhus the obstacles that confront them in their effort to
escape from Mara’s control.</P>

account of his own quest for enlightenment from the time of his life
in the palace up to his transmission of the Dhamma to his first five
disciples.</P>
<LI><P >Culahatthipadopama
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant’s
Footprint. Using the analogy of a woodsman tracking down a big bull
elephant, the Buddha explains how a disciple arrives at complete
certainty of the truth of his teaching. The sutta presents a full
account of the step-by-step training of the Buddhist monk.</P>
<LI><P >Mahahatthipadopama
Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant’s
Footprint. The venerable Sariputta begins with a statement of the
Four Noble Truths, which he then expounds by way of the
contemplation of the four elements and the dependent origination of
the five aggregates.</P>

Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Simile of the Heartwood.</P>
<LI><P >Culasaropama
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Simile of the Heartwood. These
two discourses emphasise that the proper goal of the holy life is
the unshakeable deliverance of the mind, to which all other benefits
are subsidiary.</P>
<LI><P >Culagosinga
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse in Gosinga. The Buddha meets three
bhikkhus who are living in concord, “blending like milk and
water,” and inquires how they succeed in living together so
harmoniously.</P>
<LI><P >Mahagosinga
Sutta: The Greater Discourse in Gosinga. On a beautiful moonlit
night a number of senior disciples meet together in a sala-tree wood
and discuss what kind of bhikkhu could illuminate the wood. After
each has answered according to his personal ideal, they go to the
Buddha, who provides his own answer.</P>
<LI><P >Mahagopalaka
Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Cowherd. The Buddha teaches
eleven qualities that prevent a bhikkhu’s growth in the Dhamma and
eleven qualities that contribute to his growth.</P>
<LI><P >Culagopalaka

types of bhikkhus who “breast Mara’s stream” and get safely
across to the further shore.</P>
<LI><P >Culasaccaka
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse to Saccaka. The debater Saccaka boasts
that in debate he can shake the Buddha up and down and thump him
about, but when he finally meets the Buddha their discussion takes
some unexpected turns.</P>
<LI><P >Mahasaccaka
Sutta: The Greater Discourse to Saccaka. The Buddha meets again with
Saccaka and in the course of a discussion on “development of body”
and “development of mind” he relates a detailed narrative on his
own spiritual quest.</P>
<LI><P >Culatanhasankhaya
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Destruction of Craving. The
venerable Maha Moggallana overhears the Buddha give a brief
explanation to Sakka, ruler of gods, as to how a bhikkhu is
liberated through the destruction of craving. Wishing to know if
Sakka understood the meaning, he makes a trip to the heaven of the
Thirty-three to find out.</P>
<LI><P >Mahatanhasankhaya
Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving. A
bhikkhu named Sati promulgates the pernicious view that the same
consciousness transmigrates from life to life. The Buddha reprimands
him with a lengthy discourse on dependent origination, showing how
all phenomena of existence arise and cease through conditions.</P>
<LI><P >Maha-Assapura
Sutta: The Greater Discourse at Assapura. The Buddha elucidates “the
things that make one a recluse” with a discourse covering many
aspects of the bhikkhu’s training.</P>
<LI><P >Cula-Assapura
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse at Assapura. The Buddha explains “the
way proper to the recluse” to be not the mere outward practice of
austerities but the inward purification from defilements.</P>
<LI><P >Saleyyaka
Sutta: The Brahmins of Sala.</P>
<LI><P >Veranjaka
Sutta: The Brahmins of Veranja. In these two nearly identical suttas
the Buddha explains to groups of brahmin householders the courses of
conduct leading to rebirth in lower realms and the courses leading
to higher rebirth and deliverance.</P>
<LI><P >Mahavedalla
Sutta: The Greater Series of Questions and Answers.</P>
<LI><P >Culavedalla
Sutta: The Shorter Series of Questions and Answers. These two
discourses take the form of discussions on various subtle points of
Dhamma, the former between the venerable Maha Kotthita and the
venerable Sariputta, the latter between the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna
and the lay follower Visakha.</P>
<LI><P >Culadhammasamadana
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on Ways of Undertaking Things.</P>
<LI><P >Mahadhammasamadana
Sutta: The Greater Discourse on Ways of Undertaking Things. The
Buddha explains, differently in each of the two suttas, four ways of
undertaking things, distinguished according to whether they are
painful or pleasant now and whether they ripen in pain or pleasure
in the future.</P>

Sutta: The Inquirer. The Buddha invites the bhikkhus to make a
thorough investigation of himself in order to find out whether or
not he can be accepted as fully enlightened.</P>
<LI><P >Kosambiya
Sutta: The Kosambians. During the period when the bhikkhus at
Kosambi are divided by a dispute, the Buddha teaches them the six
qualities that create love and respect and conduce to unity. He then
explains seven extraordinary knowledges possessed by a noble
disciple who has realised the fruit of stream-entry.</P>
<LI><P >Brahmanimantanika
Sutta: The Invitation of a Brahma. Baka the Brahma, a high divinity,
adopts the pernicious view that the heavenly world over which he
presides is eternal and that there is no higher state beyond. The
Buddha visits him to dissuade him from that wrong view and engages
him in a contest of Olympian dimensions.</P>
<LI><P >Maratajjaniya

Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for
noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who
has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in
their Dhamma, does not understand what things are fit for attention
and what things are unfit for attention. Since that is so, he attends
to those things unfit for attention and he does not attend to those
things fit for attention.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote36anc" HREF="#sdendnote36sym"><SUP>xxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“What are the things unfit for attention that he attends to? They
are things such that when he attends to them, the unarisen taint of
sensual desire arises in him and the arisen taint of sensual desire
increases, the unarisen taint of being arises in him and the arisen
taint of being increases, the unarisen taint of ignorance arises in
him and the arisen taint of ignorance increases. These are the things
unfit for attention that he attends to.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote37anc" HREF="#sdendnote37sym"><SUP>xxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
And what are the things fit for attention that he does not attend to?
They are things such that when he attends to them, the unarisen taint
of sensual desire does not arise in him and the arisen taint of
sensual desire is abandoned, the unarisen taint of being does not
arise in him and the arisen taint of being is abandoned, the unarisen
taint of ignorance does not arise in him and the arisen taint of
ignorance is abandoned. These are the things fit for attention that
he does not attend to. [8] By attending to things unfit for attention
and by not attending to things fit for attention, both unarisen
taints arise in him and arisen taints increase.</P>
<P  >7.
“This is how he attends unwisely: ‘Was I in the past? Was I not
in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having
been what, what did I become in the past? Shall I be in the future?
Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How
shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I become in
the future?’ Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the present
thus: ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being
come from? Where will it go?’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote38anc" HREF="#sdendnote38sym"><SUP>xxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
“When he attends unwisely in this way, one of six views arises in
him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote39anc" HREF="#sdendnote39sym"><SUP>xxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
The view ‘self exists for me’ arises in him as true and
established; or the view ‘no self exists for me’ arises in him as
true and established; or the view ‘I perceive self with self’
arises in him as true and established; or the view ‘I perceive
notself with self’ arises in him as true and established; or the
view ‘I perceive self with not-self’ arises in him as true and
established; or else he has some such view as this: ‘It is this
self of mine that speaks and feels and experiences here and there the
result of good and bad actions; but this self of mine is permanent,
everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and it will endure as
long as eternity.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote40anc" HREF="#sdendnote40sym"><SUP>xl</SUP></A></SUP>
This speculative view, bhikkhus, is called the thicket of views, the
wilderness of views, the contortion of views, the vacillation of
views, the fetter of views. Fettered by the fetter of views, the
untaught ordinary person is not freed from birth, ageing, and death,
from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; he is not freed
from suffering, I say.</P>

“Bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple, who has regard for noble
ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard
for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma,
understands what things are fit for attention and what things are
unfit for attention. Since that is so, [9] he does not attend to
those things unfit for attention and he attends to those things fit
for attention.</P>
<P  >10.
“What are the things unfit for attention that he does not attend
to? They are things such that when he attends to them, the unarisen
taint of sensual desire arises in him … (as §6) … and the arisen
taint of ignorance increases. These are the things unfit for
attention that he does not attend to. And what are the things fit for
attention that he attends to? They are things such that when he
attends to them, the unarisen taint of sensual desire does not arise
in him … (as §6) … and the arisen taint of ignorance is
abandoned. These are the things fit for attention that he attends to.
By not attending to things unfit for attention and by attending to
things fit for attention, unarisen taints do not arise in him and
arisen taints are abandoned.</P>

avoiding [12] have been abandoned by avoiding, when the taints that

the taints that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned

with the restraint of all the taints. He has severed craving, flung
off the fetters, and with the complete penetration of conceit he has
made an end of suffering.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote50anc" HREF="#sdendnote50sym"><SUP>l</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading4"  >
3. Dhammadayada Sutta - Heirs in Dhamma</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
Savattht in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote51anc" HREF="#sdendnote51sym"><SUP>li</SUP></A></SUP>
- “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things.
Out of compassion for you I have thought: ‘How shall my disciples
be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?’ If you are
my heirs in material things, not my heirs in Dhamma, you will be
reproached thus: ‘The Teacher’s disciples live as his heirs in
material things, not as heirs in Dhamma’; and I will be reproached
thus: ‘The Teacher’s disciples live as his heirs in material
things, not as his heirs in Dhamma.’</P>
<P  >“If
you are my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things, you will
not be reproached [as it will be said]: ‘The Teacher’s disciples
live as his heirs in Dhamma, not as his heirs in material things’;
and I will not be reproached [as it will be said]: ‘The Teacher’s
disciples live as his heirs in Dhamma, not as his heirs in material
things.’ Therefore, bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs
in material things. Out of compassion for you I have thought: ‘How
shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material
things?’</P>
<P  >3.
“Now, bhikkhus, suppose that I had eaten, refused more food, had my
fill, finished, had enough, had what I needed, and some almsfood was
left over to be thrown away. Then two bhikkhus arrived [13] hungry
and weak, and I told them: ‘Bhikkhus, I have eaten … had what I
needed, but there is this almsfood of mine left over to be thrown
away. Eat if you like; if you do not eat then I shall throw it away
where there is no greenery or drop it into water where there is no
life.’ Then one bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One has eaten …
had what he needed, but there is this almsfood of the Blessed One
left over to be thrown away; if we do not eat it the Blessed One will
throw it away … But this has been said by the Blessed One:
“Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things.”
Now this almsfood is one of the material things. Suppose that instead
of eating this almsfood I pass the night and day hungry and weak.’
And instead of eating that almsfood he passed that night and day
hungry and weak. Then the second bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One
has eaten … had what he needed, but there is this almsfood of the
Blessed One left over to be thrown away … Suppose that I eat this
almsfood and pass the night and day neither hungry nor weak.’ And
after eating that almsfood he passed the night and day neither hungry
nor weak. Now although that bhikkhu by eating that almsfood passed
the night and day neither hungry nor weak, yet the first bhikkhu is
more to be respected and commended by me. Why is that? Because that
will for long conduce to his fewness of wishes, contentment,
effacement, easy support, and arousal of energy.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote52anc" HREF="#sdendnote52sym"><SUP>lii</SUP></A></SUP>
Therefore, bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material
things. Out of compassion for you I have thought: ‘How shall my
disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?’“</P>
<P  >4.
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One
rose from his seat and went into his dwelling. Soon after he had
left, the venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Friends,
bhikkhus.” - “Friend,” they replied. [14] The venerable
Sariputta said this:</P>
<P  >5.
“Friends, in what way do disciples of the Teacher who lives
secluded not train in seclusion? And in what way do disciples of the
Teacher who lives secluded train in seclusion?”</P>
<P  >“Indeed,
friend, we would come from far away to learn from the venerable
Sariputta the meaning of this statement. It would be good if the
venerable Sariputta would explain the meaning of this statement.
Having heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember it.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
friends, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” “Yes,
friend,” the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Sariputta said this:</P>
<P  >6.
“Friends, in what way do disciples of the Teacher who lives
secluded not train in seclusion? Here disciples of the Teacher who
lives secluded do not train in seclusion; they do not abandon what

“There are, brahmin, some recluses and brahmins who perceive day

this is an abiding in delusion. But I perceive night when it is night

“Now, brahmin, it might be that you think: ‘Perhaps the recluse
Gotama is not free from lust, hate, and delusion even today, which is
why he still resorts to remote jungle-thicket resting places in the
forest.’ But you should not think thus. It is because I see two

I have compassion for future generations.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote68anc" HREF="#sdendnote68sym"><SUP>lxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

[24] Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today
let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
for refuge for life.”</P>

5. Anangana Sutta - Without Blemishes</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There the
venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus. “Friends,
bhikkhus.” - “Friend,” they replied. The venerable Sariputta
said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Friends, there are these four kinds of persons found existing in
the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote69anc" HREF="#sdendnote69sym"><SUP>lxix</SUP></A></SUP>
What four? Here some person with a blemish does not understand it as
it actually is thus: ‘I have a blemish in myself.’ Here some
person with a blemish understands it as it actually is thus: ‘I
have a blemish in myself.’ Here some person with no blemish does
not understand it as it actually is thus: ‘I have no blemish in
myself.’ Here some person with no blemish understands it as it
actually is thus: ‘I have no blemish in myself.’</P>
<P  >“Herein,
the person with a blemish who does not understand it as it actually
is thus: ‘I have a blemish in myself’ is called the inferior of
these two persons with a blemish. Herein, the person with a blemish
who understands it as it actually is thus: ‘I have a blemish in
myself’ is called the superior of these two persons with a blemish.</P>
<P  >“Herein,
the person with no blemish [25] who does not understand it as it
actually is thus: ‘I have no blemish’ is called the inferior of
these two persons with no blemish. Herein, the person with no blemish
who understands it as it actually is thus: ‘I have no blemish’ is
called the superior of these two persons with no blemish.”</P>
<P  >3.
When this was said, the venerable Maha Moggallana asked the venerable
Sariputta: “Friend Sariputta, what is the cause and reason why, of
these two persons with a blemish, one is called the inferior man and
one is called the superior man? What is the cause and reason why, of
these two persons with no blemish, one is called the inferior man and
one is called the superior man?”</P>
<P  >4.
“Herein, friend, when a person with a blemish does not understand
it as it actually is thus: ‘I have a blemish in myself,’ it can
be expected that he will not arouse zeal, make effort, or instigate
energy to abandon that blemish, and that he will die with lust, hate,
and delusion, with a blemish, with mind defiled. Suppose a bronze
dish were brought from a shop or a smithy covered with dirt and
stains, and the owners neither used it nor had it cleaned but put it
away in a dusty corner. Would the bronze dish thus get more defiled
and stained later on?” - “Yes, friend.” - “So too, friend,
when a person with a blemish does not understand it as it actually is
thus: ‘I have a blemish in myself,’ it can be expected … that
he will die … with mind defiled.</P>

expected that he will give attention to the sign of the beautiful,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote70anc" HREF="#sdendnote70sym"><SUP>lxx</SUP></A></SUP>
that by his doing so lust will infect his mind, and that he will die

“This is the cause and reason why, of these two persons with a

“‘Blemish, blemish,’ is said, friend, but what is this word
‘blemish’ a term for? ‘Blemish,’ friend, is a term for the

“It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: ‘If I commit an
offence, let the bhikkhus not know that I have committed an offence.’
And it is possible that the bhikkhus come to know that that bhikkhu

equal admonishes him, not a person his equal. So he is angry and
bitter thus: ‘A person not my equal admonishes me, not a person my
equal.’ The anger and bitterness are both a blemish.</P>
<P  >13.
“It is possible that a bhikkhu here might wish: ‘Oh that the

questions of me, not of some other bhikkhu!’ And it is possible
that the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus by asking a
series of questions of some other bhikkhu, [28] not of that bhikkhu.
So he is angry and bitter thus: ‘The Teacher teaches the Dhamma to
the bhikkhus by asking a series of questions of some other bhikkhu,

When this was said, the venerable Maha Moggallana said to the
venerable Sariputta: “A simile occurs to me, friend Sariputta.” -
“State it, friend Moggallana.” - “On one occasion, friend, I
was living at the Hill Fort at Rajagaha. Then, when it was morning, I
dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe, I went into Rajagaha for
alms. Now on that occasion Samiti the cartwright’s son was planing
a felloe and the Ajivaka Panduputta, son of a former cartwright, was
standing by.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote73anc" HREF="#sdendnote73sym"><SUP>lxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then this thought arose in the Ajivaka Panduputta’s mind: ‘Oh
that this Samiti the cartwright’s son might plane this bend, this
twist, this fault, out of the felloe so that it would be without
bends, twists, or faults, and come to consist purely of heartwood.’
[32] And just as this thought came to pass in his mind, so did Samiti
the cartwright’s son plane that bend, that twist, that fault, out
of the felloe. Then the AjIvaka Panduputta, son of a former
cartwright, was glad and he voiced his gladness thus: ‘He planes
just as if he knew my heart with his heart!’</P>
<P  >32.
“So too, friend, there are persons who are faithless and have gone
forth from the home life into homelessness not out of faith but
seeking a livelihood, who are fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous,
haughty, hollow, personally vain, rough-tongued, loose-spoken,
unguarded in their sense faculties, immoderate in eating, undevoted
to wakefulness, unconcerned with recluseship, not greatly respectful
of training, luxurious, careless, leaders in backsliding, neglectful
of seclusion, lazy, wanting in energy, unmindful, not fully aware,
unconcentrated, with straying minds, devoid of wisdom, drivellers.

respectful of training, not luxurious or careless, who are keen to
avoid backsliding, leaders in seclusion, energetic, resolute,

“Just as a woman - or a man - young, youthful, fond of adornments,

THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote84anc" HREF="#sdendnote84sym"><SUP>lxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s
Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
“Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One
said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, suppose a cloth were defiled and stained, and a dyer
dipped it in some dye or other, whether blue or yellow or red or
pink; it would look poorly dyed and impure in colour. Why is that?
Because of the impurity of the cloth. So too, when the mind is
defiled, an unhappy destination may be expected.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote85anc" HREF="#sdendnote85sym"><SUP>lxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Bhikkhus, suppose a cloth were pure and bright, and a dyer dipped it
in some dye or other, whether blue or yellow or red or pink; it would
look well-dyed and pure in colour. Why is that? Because of the purity
of the cloth. So too, when the mind is undefiled, a happy destination
may be expected.</P>
<P  >3.
“What, bhikkhus, are the imperfections that defile the mind?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote86anc" HREF="#sdendnote86sym"><SUP>lxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection that defiles

Ill will … anger … revenge … contempt … a domineering
attitude … envy … avarice … deceit … fraud … obstinacy …
presumption … conceit … arrogance … vanity … [37] …
negligence is an imperfection that defiles the mind.</P>
<P  >4.
“Knowing that covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection
that defiles the mind, a bhikkhu abandons it.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote88anc" HREF="#sdendnote88sym"><SUP>lxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Knowing that ill will … negligence is an imperfection that defiles
the mind, a bhikkhu abandons it.</P>
<P  >5.
“When a bhikkhu has known that covetousness and unrighteous greed
is an imperfection that defiles the mind and has abandoned it; when a
bhikkhu has known that ill will … negligence is an imperfection
that defiles the mind and has abandoned it, he acquires perfect
confidence in the Buddha thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote89anc" HREF="#sdendnote89sym"><SUP>lxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
‘The Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in
true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable
leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans,
enlightened, blessed.’</P>
<P  >6.
“He acquires perfect confidence in the Dhamma thus: ‘The Dhamma
is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, visible here and now,
immediately effective, inviting inspection, onward leading, to be
experienced by the wise for themselves.’</P>
<P  >7.
“He acquires perfect confidence in the Sangha thus: ‘The Sangha
of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the good way,
practising the straight way, practising the true way, practising the
proper way, that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of
individuals; this Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is worthy
of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of
reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the
world.’</P>
<P  >8.
“When he has given up, expelled, released, abandoned, and
relinquished [the imperfections of the mind] in part,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote90anc" HREF="#sdendnote90sym"><SUP>xc</SUP></A></SUP>
he considers thus: ‘I am possessed of perfect confidence in the
Buddha,’ and he gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration

gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. When he is glad, rapture is

“Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu of such virtue, such a state [of
concentration], and such wisdom<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote93anc" HREF="#sdendnote93sym"><SUP>xciii</SUP></A></SUP>
eats almsfood consisting of choice hill rice along with various

<P  >13.
“He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote95anc" HREF="#sdendnote95sym"><SUP>xcv</SUP></A></SUP>
likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so
above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he

<P  >14-16.
“He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion

<P  >17.
“He understands thus: ‘There is this, there is the inferior,

field of perception.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote96anc" HREF="#sdendnote96sym"><SUP>xcvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >18.
“When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It is
liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’ [39] Bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is
called one bathed with the inner bathing.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote97anc" HREF="#sdendnote97sym"><SUP>xcvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >19.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja was sitting not
far from the Blessed One. Then he said to the Blessed One: “But
does Master Gotama go to the Bahuka River to bathe?”</P>
<P  >“Why,
brahmin, go to the Bahuka River? What can the Bahuka River do?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Gotama, the Bahuka River is held by many to give liberation, it is
held by many to give merit, and many wash away their evil actions in
the Bahuka River.”</P>
<P  >20.
Then the Blessed One addressed the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja in
stanzas:</P>
<P >
“Bahuka and Adhikakka,</P>
<P >
Gaya and Sundarika too,</P>
<P >
Payaga and Sarassati,</P>

And the stream Bahumati - <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote98anc" HREF="#sdendnote98sym"><SUP>xcviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >

<P >

<P >

<P >
What can the Sundarika bring to pass?</P>
<P >
What the Payaga? What the Bahuka?</P>
<P >
They cannot purify an evil-doer,</P>
<P >
A man who has done cruel and brutal deeds.</P>

<P >
One fair in act, one pure in heart</P>
<P >
Brings his virtue to perfection.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
It is here, brahmin, that you should bathe,</P>
<P >
To make yourself a refuge for all beings.</P>
<P >
And if you speak no falsehood</P>
<P >
Nor work harm for living beings,</P>
<P >
Nor take what is offered not,</P>
<P >
With faith and free from avarice,</P>
<P >
What need for you to go to Gaya?</P>
<P >
For any well will be your Gaya.”</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >21.
When this was said, the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja said:
“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would
receive the going forth under Master Gotama, I would receive the full
admission.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote100anc" HREF="#sdendnote100sym"><SUP>c</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >22.
And the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja received the going forth under
the Blessed One, and he received the full admission. [40] And soon,
not long after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn,
diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Bharadvaja, by
realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered
upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of
which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness.
He directly knew: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being.” And the venerable Bharadvaja became one of the
arahants.</P>

On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthii in Jeta’s

Then, when it was evening, the venerable Maha Cunda rose from
meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the
Blessed One he sat down at one side and said to him:</P>

“Venerable sir, various views arise in the world associated either
with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote102anc" HREF="#sdendnote102sym"><SUP>cii</SUP></A></SUP>

<H3 >(THE EIGHT ATTAINMENTS)</H3>

“It is possible here, Cunda, that quite secluded from sensual
pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, some bhikkhu enters upon
and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He
might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But it is not
these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One’s

“It is possible here that with the stilling of applied and

jhana, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without
applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of
concentration. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’
But … these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the
Noble One’s Discipline.</P>
<P  >6.
“It is possible here that with the fading away as well of rapture,
some bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still
feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the
third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a
pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’ He might think
thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But … these are called
‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</P>
<P  >7.
“It is possible here that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain,
and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, some bhikkhu
enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’
But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in

“It is possible here that with the complete surmounting of
perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory
impact, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that
‘space is infinite,’ some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the

9. Sammaditthi Sutta - Right View</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There the
venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Friends,
bhikkhus.” - “Friend,” they replied. The venerable Sariputta
said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“‘One of right view, one of right view,’ is said, friends. In
what way is a noble disciple one of right view, whose view is
straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived
at this true Dhamma?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote114anc" HREF="#sdendnote114sym"><SUP>cxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Indeed,
friend, we would come from far away to learn from the venerable
Sariputta the meaning of this statement. It would be good if the
venerable Sariputta would explain the meaning of this statement.
Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
friends, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” “Yes,
friend,” the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Sariputta said this:</P>
<H5 >(THE WHOLESOME AND THE UNWHOLESOME)</H5>
<P  >3.
“When, friends, a noble disciple understands the unwholesome and
the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the
wholesome, [47] in that way he is one of right view, whose view is
straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at
this true Dhamma.</P>
<P  >4.
“And what, friends, is the unwholesome, what is the root of the
unwholesome, what is the wholesome, what is the root of the
wholesome? Killing living beings is unwholesome; taking what is not
given is unwholesome; misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome;
false speech is unwholesome; malicious speech is unwholesome; harsh
speech is unwholesome; gossip is unwholesome; covetousness is
unwholesome; ill will is unwholesome; wrong view is unwholesome. This
is called the unwholesome.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote115anc" HREF="#sdendnote115sym"><SUP>cxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
“And what is the root of the unwholesome? Greed is a root of the
unwholesome; hate is a root of the unwholesome; delusion is a root of
the unwholesome. This is called the root of the unwholesome.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote116anc" HREF="#sdendnote116sym"><SUP>cxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“And what is the wholesome? Abstention from killing living beings
is wholesome; abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome;
abstention from misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome;
abstention from false speech is wholesome; abstention from malicious
speech is wholesome; abstention from harsh speech is wholesome;
abstention from gossip is wholesome; uncovetousness is wholesome;
non-ill will is wholesome; right view is wholesome. This is called
the wholesome.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote117anc" HREF="#sdendnote117sym"><SUP>cxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >7.
“And what is the root of the wholesome? Non-greed is a root of the

root of the wholesome. This is called the root of the wholesome.</P>
<P  >8.
“When a noble disciple has thus understood the unwholesome and the
root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the
wholesome,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote118anc" HREF="#sdendnote118sym"><SUP>cxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust, he abolishes
the underlying tendency to aversion, he extirpates the underlying

ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of
suffering.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote119anc" HREF="#sdendnote119sym"><SUP>cxix</SUP></A></SUP>
In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view, whose view is

<H5 >(NUTRIMENT)</H5>
<P  >9.
Saying, “Good, friend,” the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in
the venerable Sariputta’s words. Then they asked him a further
question: “But, friend, might there be another way in which a noble
disciple is one of right view … and has arrived at this true
Dhamma?” - “There might be, friends.</P>
<P  >10.
“When, friends, a noble disciple understands nutriment, the origin
of nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the
cessation of nutriment, in that way he is one of right view … and
has arrived [48] at this true Dhamma.</P>
<P  >11.
“And what is nutriment, what is the origin of nutriment, what is
the cessation of nutriment, what is the way leading to the cessation
of nutriment? There are four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance
of beings that already have come to be and for the support of those
seeking a new existence. What four? They are: physical food as
nutriment, gross or subtle; contact as the second; mental volition as
the third; and consciousness as the fourth.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote120anc" HREF="#sdendnote120sym"><SUP>cxx</SUP></A></SUP>
With the arising of craving there is the arising of nutriment. With
the cessation of craving there is the cessation of nutriment. The way
leading to the cessation of nutriment is just this Noble Eightfold
Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
concentration.</P>
<P  >12.
“When a noble disciple has thus understood nutriment, the origin of
nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the
cessation of nutriment, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency

extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit ‘I am,’
and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and

<H5 >(THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS)</H5>
<P  >13.

question: “But, friend, might there be another way in which a noble
disciple is one of right view … and has arrived at this true
Dhamma?” - “There might be, friends.</P>
<P  >14.
“When, friends, a noble disciple understands suffering, the origin
of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the
cessation of suffering, in that way he is one of right view … and
has arrived at this true Dhamma.</P>
<P  >15.
“And what is suffering, what is the origin of suffering, what is
the cessation of suffering, what is the way leading to the cessation
of suffering? Birth is suffering; ageing is suffering; sickness is
suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair are suffering; not to obtain what one wants is suffering; in
short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering. This
is called suffering.</P>
<P  >16.
“And what is the origin of suffering? It is craving, which brings
renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in
this and that; that is, craving for sensual pleasures [49], craving
for being, and craving for non-being. This is called the origin of
suffering.</P>
<P  >17.
“And what is the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless
fading away and ceasing, the giving up, relinquishing, letting go,
and rejecting of that same craving. This is called the cessation of
suffering.</P>
<P  >18.
“And what is the way leading to the cessation of suffering? It is
just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view … right
concentration. This is called the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.</P>
<P  >19.
“When a noble disciple has thus understood suffering, the origin of
suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the
cessation of suffering … he here and now makes an end of suffering.
In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view … and has
arrived at this true Dhamma.”</P>
<H5 >(AGEING AND DEATH)</H5>
<P  >20.
Saying, “Good, friend,” the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in

<P  >22.
“And what is ageing and death, what is the origin of ageing and
death, what is the cessation of ageing and death, what is the way
leading to the cessation of -ageing and death? The ageing of beings
in the various orders of beings, their old age, brokenness of teeth,
greyness of hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of life, weakness of
faculties - this is called ageing. The passing of beings out of the
various orders of beings, their passing away, dissolution,
disappearance, dying, completion of time, dissolution of the
aggregates,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote122anc" HREF="#sdendnote122sym"><SUP>cxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
laying down of the body - this is called death. So this ageing and
this death are what is called ageing and death. With the arising of
birth there is the arising of ageing and death. With the cessation of
birth there is the cessation of ageing and death. The way leading to
the cessation of ageing and death is just this Noble Eightfold Path;
that is, right view … right concentration.</P>

“In this way he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects

And how does a bhikkhu abide contemplating mind-objects as

understands as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’; he

mindfulness that ‘there are mind-objects’ is simply established
in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness.

“Bhikkhus, if anyone should develop these four foundations of
mindfulness in such a way for seven years, one of two fruits could be
expected for him: either final knowledge here and now, or if there is
a trace of clinging left, non-return.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote165anc" HREF="#sdendnote165sym"><SUP>clxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Let
alone seven years, bhikkhus. [63] If anyone should develop these four
foundations of mindfulness in such a way for six years … for five
years … for four years … for three years … for two years …
for one year, one of two fruits could be expected for him: either
final knowledge here and now, or if there is a trace of clinging
left, non-return.</P>
<P  >“Let
alone one year, bhikkhus. If anyone should develop these four
foundations of mindfulness in such a way for seven months … for six

“So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘Bhikkhus,
this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the
surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain
and grief, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of
Nibbana - namely, the four foundations of mindfulness.’“</P>

11. Culasihanada Sutta - The Shorter Discourse<BR>on the Lion’s
Roar</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, only here is there a recluse, only here a second
recluse, only here a third recluse, only here a fourth recluse. The
doctrines of others are devoid [64] of recluses: that is how you
should rightly roar your lion’s roar.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote166anc" HREF="#sdendnote166sym"><SUP>clxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
“It is possible, bhikkhus, that wanderers of other sects might ask:
‘But on the strength of what [argument] or with the support of what
[authority] do the venerable ones say thus?’ Wanderers of other
sects who ask thus may be answered in this way: ‘Friends, four
things have been declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened; on seeing these in
ourselves we say thus: “Only here is there a recluse, only here a
second recluse, only here a third recluse, only here a fourth
recluse. The doctrines of others are devoid of recluses.” What are
the four? We have confidence in the Teacher, we have confidence in
the Dhamma, we have fulfilled the precepts, and our companions in the
Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us whether they are laymen or those
gone forth. These are the four things declared to us by the Blessed
One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, on seeing
which in ourselves we say as we do.’</P>
<P  >4.
“It is possible, bhikkhus, that wanderers of other sects might say
thus: ‘Friends, we too have confidence in the Teacher, that is, in
our Teacher; we too have confidence in the Dhamma, that is, in our
Dhamma; we too have fulfilled the precepts, that is, our precepts;
and our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us too
whether they are laymen or those gone forth. What is the distinction
here, friends, what is the variance, what is the difference between
you and us?’</P>
<P  >5.
“Wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way:
‘How then, friends, is the goal one or many?’ Answering rightly,
the wanderers of other sects would answer thus: ‘Friends, the goal
is one, not many.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote167anc" HREF="#sdendnote167sym"><SUP>clxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
-’But, friends, is that goal for one affected by lust or free from
lust?’ Answering rightly, the wanderers of other sects would answer
thus: ‘Friends, that goal is for one free from lust, not for one
affected by lust.’ - ‘But, friends, is that goal for one affected
by hate or free from hate?’ Answering rightly, they would answer:
‘Friends, that goal is for one free from hate, not for one affected
by hate.’ - ‘But, friends, is that goal for one affected by
delusion or free from delusion?’ Answering rightly, they would
answer: ‘Friends, that goal is for one free from delusion, not for
one affected by delusion.’ -’But, friends, is that goal for one
affected by craving or free from craving?’ [65] Answering rightly,
they would answer: ‘Friends, that goal is for one free from
craving, not for one affected by craving.’ - ‘But, friends, is
that goal for one affected by clinging or free from clinging?’
Answering rightly, they would answer: ‘Friends, that goal is for
one free from clinging, not for one affected by clinging.’ -’But,
friends, is that goal for one who has vision or for one without
vision?’ Answering rightly, they would answer: ‘Friends, that
goal is for one with vision, not for one without vision.’ - ‘But,
friends, is that goal for one who favours and opposes, or for one who
does not favour and oppose?’ Answering rightly, they would answer:
‘Friends, that goal is for one who does not favour and oppose, not
for one who favours and opposes.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote168anc" HREF="#sdendnote168sym"><SUP>clxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
- ‘But, friends, is that goal for one who delights in and enjoys
proliferation, or for one who does not delight in and enjoy
proliferation?’ Answering rightly, they would answer: ‘Friends,
that goal is for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation,
not for one who delights in and enjoys proliferation.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote169anc" HREF="#sdendnote169sym"><SUP>clxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Bhikkhus, there are these two views: the view of being and the
view of non-being. Any recluses or brahmins who rely on the view of
being, adopt the view of being, accept the view of being, are opposed
to the view of non-being. Any recluses or brahmins who rely on the
view of non-being, adopt the view of non-being, accept the view of
non-being, are opposed to the view of being.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote170anc" HREF="#sdendnote170sym"><SUP>clxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>

are the origin, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger, and
the escape<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote171anc" HREF="#sdendnote171sym"><SUP>clxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
in the case of these two views are affected by lust, affected by
hate, affected by delusion, affected by craving, affected by
clinging, without vision, given to favouring and opposing, and they
delight in and enjoy proliferation. They are not freed from birth,
ageing, and death; from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair; they are not freed from suffering, I say.</P>

<P  >9.
“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of clinging. What four?
Clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to rules
and observances, and clinging to a doctrine of self.</P>
<P  >10.
“Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full
understanding of all kinds of clinging, they do not completely
describe the full understanding of all kinds of clinging.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote172anc" HREF="#sdendnote172sym"><SUP>clxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
They describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures
without describing the full understanding of clinging to views,
clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to a doctrine of
self. Why is that? Those good recluses and brahmins do not understand
these three instances of clinging as they actually are. Therefore,
though they claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of
clinging, they describe only the full understanding of clinging to
sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of
clinging to views, clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to
a doctrine of self.</P>
<P  >11.
“Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full
understanding of all kinds of clinging … they describe the full
understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views
without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and
observances and clinging to a doctrine of self. Why is that? They do
not understand two instances … therefore they describe only the
full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to
views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules
and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self.</P>
<P  >12.
“Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full
understanding of all kinds of clinging … they describe the full
understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views,

<P  >13.
“Bhikkhus, in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that, it is plain
that confidence in the Teacher is not rightly directed, that
confidence in the Dhamma is not rightly directed, that fulfilment of
the precepts is not rightly directed, and that the affection among
companions in the Dhamma is not rightly directed. Why is that?
Because that is how it is when the Dhamma and Discipline is [67]
badly proclaimed and badly expounded, unemancipating, unconducive to
peace, expounded by one who is not fully enlightened.</P>
<P  >14.
“Bhikkhus, when a Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened,
claims to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging,
he completely describes the full understanding of all kinds of
clinging: he describes the full understanding of clinging to sensual
pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to rules and observances, and
clinging to a doctrine of self.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote174anc" HREF="#sdendnote174sym"><SUP>clxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Bhikkhus, in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that, it is plain
that confidence in the Teacher is rightly directed, that confidence
in the Dhamma is rightly directed, that fulfilment of the precepts is
rightly directed, and that the affection among companions in the
Dhamma is rightly directed. Why is that? Because that is how it is
when the Dhamma and Discipline is well-proclaimed and well-expounded,
emancipating, conducive to peace, expounded by one who is fully
enlightened.</P>
<P  >16.
“Now these four kinds of clinging have what as their source, what
as their origin, from what are they born and produced?</P>
<P  >These
four kinds of clinging have craving as their source, craving as their
origin, they are born and produced from craving.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote175anc" HREF="#sdendnote175sym"><SUP>clxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Craving has what as its source … ? Craving has feeling as its
source … Feeling has what as its source … ? Feeling has contact
as its source … Contact has what as its source … ? Contact has
the sixfold base as its source … The sixfold base has what as its

Mentalitymateriality has consciousness as its source …
Consciousness has what as its source … ? Consciousness has
formations as its source … Formations have what as their source …
? Formations have ignorance as their source, ignorance as their
origin, they are born and produced from ignorance.</P>
<P  >17.
“Bhikkhus, when ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge has
arisen in a bhikkhu, then with the fading away of ignorance and the
arising of true knowledge he no longer clings to sensual pleasures,
no longer clings to views, no longer clings to rules and observances,
no longer clings to a doctrine of self.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote176anc" HREF="#sdendnote176sym"><SUP>clxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
When he does not cling, he is not agitated. When he is not agitated,
he personally attains Nibbana. He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed,
the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done,
there is no more coming to any state of being.’” [68]</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading13"  >
12. Mahasihanada Sutta - The Greater Discourse on the Lion’s Roar</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Vesali in the grove outside the city to the west.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, had recently
left this Dhamma and Discipline.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote177anc" HREF="#sdendnote177sym"><SUP>clxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
He was making this statement before the Vesali assembly: “The
recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction
in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote178anc" HREF="#sdendnote178sym"><SUP>clxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma [merely] hammered out by
reasoning, following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him, and
when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it leads him when he practises
it to the complete destruction of suffering.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote179anc" HREF="#sdendnote179sym"><SUP>clxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Sariputta dressed, and
taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Vesali for alms. Then he
heard Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, making this statement before
the Vesali assembly. When he had wandered for alms in Vesali and had
returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to the Blessed
One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told
the Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was saying.</P>
<P  >4.
[The Blessed One said:] “Sariputta, the misguided man Sunakkhatta
is angry and his words are spoken out of anger. Thinking to discredit
the Tathagata, he actually praises him; [69] for it is praise of the
Tathagata to say of him: ‘When he teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it
leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of
suffering.’</P>
<P  >5.
“Sariputta, this misguided man Sunakkhatta will never infer of me
according to Dhamma: ‘That Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote180anc" HREF="#sdendnote180sym"><SUP>clxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘That Blessed
one enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power: having been one,
he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and
vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure,
through a mountain, as though through space; he dives in and out of
the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking
as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space
like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so
powerful and mighty; he wields bodily mastery even as far as the
Brahma-world.’</P>
<P  >7.
“And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘With the
divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, that
Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds, the heavenly and the human,
those that are far as well as near.’</P>
<P  >8.
“And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘That Blessed
One encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings, other
persons. He understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust
and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; he understands a
mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by
hate as unaffected by hate; he understands a mind affected by
delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as
unaffected by delusion; he understands a contracted mind as
contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; he understands an
exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; he
understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as
unsurpassed; he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and
an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; he understands a liberated
mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated.’</P>
<H5 >(TEN POWERS OF A TATHAGATA)</H5>

“Sariputta, the Tathagata has these ten Tathagata’s powers,

lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of

is, one birth, two births … (as Sutta 4, §27) … Thus with their
aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. That
too is a Tathagata’s power …</P>
<P  >18.
(9) “Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses
the human, the Tathagata sees beings passing away and reappearing,
inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate …
(as Sutta 4, §29) [71] … and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions. That too is a Tathagata’s power …</P>
<P  >19.
(10) “Again, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, the
Tathagata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of
mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the
destruction of the taints. That too is a Tathagata’s power that the
Tathagata has, by virtue of which he claims the herd-leader’s
place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling
the Wheel of Brahma.</P>

“The Tathagata has these ten Tathagata’s powers, possessing which

things.’ [72] And seeing no ground for that, I abide in safety,
fearlessness, and intrepidity.</P>

What is moisture-born generation? There are these beings born in a

practised seclusion - the extreme of seclusion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote193anc" HREF="#sdendnote193sym"><SUP>cxciii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >45.
“Such was my asceticism, Sariputta, that I went naked, rejecting
conventions, licking my hands, not coming when asked, not stopping
when asked; I did not accept food brought or food specially made or
an invitation to a meal; I received nothing from a pot, from a bowl,
across a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating
together, from a pregnant woman, from a woman giving suck, from a
woman lying with a man, from where food was advertised to be
distributed, from where a dog was waiting, from where flies were
buzzing; I accepted no fish or meat, I drank no liquor, wine, or
fermented brew. I kept to one house, to one morsel; I kept to two
[78] houses, to two morsels; … I kept to seven houses, to seven
morsels. I lived on one saucerful a day, on two saucerfuls a day …
on seven saucerfuls a day; I took food once a day, once every two
days … once every seven days, and so on up to once every fortnight;
I dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals. I
was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or hideparings or moss
or ricebran or rice-scum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung. I
lived on forest roots and fruits; I fed on fallen fruits. I clothed
myself in hemp, in hemp-mixed cloth, in shrouds, in refuse rags, in
tree bark, in antelope hide, in strips of antelope hide, in
kusa-grass fabric, in bark fabric, in woodshavings fabric, in
head-hair wool, in animal wool, in owls’ wings. I was one who
pulled out hair and beard, pursuing the practice of pulling out hair
and beard. I was one who stood continuously, rejecting seats. I was
one who squatted continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting
position. I was one who used a mattress of spikes; I made a mattress
of spikes my bed. I dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water
three times daily including the evening. Thus in such a variety of
ways I dwelt pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the
body. Such was my asceticism.</P>
<P  >46.
“Such was my coarseness, Sariputta, that just as the bole of a
tinduka tree, accumulating over the years, cakes and flakes off, so
too, dust and dirt, accumulating over the years, caked off my body
and flaked off. It never occurred to me: ‘Oh, let me rub this dust
and dirt off with my hand, or let another rub this dust and dirt off
with his hand’ - it never occurred to me thus. Such was my
coarseness.</P>
<P  >47.
“Such was my scrupulousness, Sariputta, that I was always mindful
in stepping forwards and stepping backwards. I was full of pity even
for [the beings in] a drop of water thus: ‘Let me not hurt the tiny
creatures in the crevices of the ground.’ Such was my
scrupulousness.</P>
<P  >48.
“Such was my seclusion, Sariputta, that [79] I would plunge into
some forest and dwell there. And when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd
or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a woodsman, I would flee
from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hollow to hollow,
from hillock to hillock. Why was that? So that they should not see me
or I see them. Just as a forest-bred deer, on seeing human beings,
flees from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hollow to
hollow, from hillock to hillock, so too, when I saw a cowherd or a
shepherd … Such was my seclusion.</P>
<P  >49.
“I would go on all fours to the cow-pens when the cattle had gone
out and the cowherd had left them, and I would feed on the dung of
the young suckling calves. As long as my own excrement and urine
lasted, I fed on my own excrement and urine. Such was my great
distortion in feeding.</P>
<P  >50.
“I would plunge into some awe-inspiring grove and dwell there - a
grove so awe-inspiring that normally it would make a man’s hair
stand up if he were not free from lust. When those cold wintry nights
came during the ‘eight-days interval of frost,’ I would dwell by
night in the open and by day in the grove.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote194anc" HREF="#sdendnote194sym"><SUP>cxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
In the last month of the hot season I would dwell by day in the open

stanza never heard before:</P>
<P >
‘Chilled by night and scorched by day,</P>
<P >
Alone in awe-inspiring groves,</P>
<P >
Naked, no fire to sit beside,</P>
<P >
The sage yet pursues his quest.’</P>

“I would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead
for a pillow. And cowherd boys came up and spat on me, urinated on
me, threw dirt at me, and poked sticks into my ears. Yet I do not
recall that I ever aroused an evil mind [of hate] against them. Such
was my abiding in equanimity. [80]</P>

They say: ‘Let us live on kola-fruits,’ and they eat kolafruits,
they eat kola-fruit powder, they drink kola-fruit water, and they
make many kinds of kola-fruit concoctions. Now I recall having eaten
a single kola-fruit a day. Sariputta, you may think that the
kola-fruit was bigger at that time, yet you should not regard it so:
the kola-fruit was then at most the same size as now. Through feeding
on a single kola-fruit a day, my body reached a state of extreme
emaciation. Because of eating so little my limbs became like the
jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems. Because of eating so
little my backside became like a camel’s hoof. Because of eating so
little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads.
Because of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy
rafters of an old roofless barn. Because of eating so little the
gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets, looking like a gleam
of water that has sunk far down in a deep well. Because of eating so
little my scalp shrivelled and withered as a green bitter gourd
shrivels and withers in the wind and sun. Because of eating so little
my belly skin adhered to my backbone; thus if I touched my belly skin
I encountered my backbone, and if I touched my backbone I encountered
my belly skin. Because of eating so little, if I tried to ease my
body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its
roots, fell from my body as I rubbed.</P>

“Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine

say: ‘Let us live on beans,’ … ’Let us live on sesamum,’ …
’Let us live on rice,’ and they eat rice, they eat rice powder,
[81] they drink rice water, and they make many kinds of rice
concoctions. Now I recall having eaten a single rice grain a day.

“Yet, Sariputta, by such conduct, by such practice, by such
performance of austerities, I did not attain any superhuman states,
any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Why

attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practises in

“Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine

black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the
prime of life, so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdom. But when
this good man is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life,
and come to the last stage, being eighty, ninety, or a hundred years
old, then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost.’ But it should not be
regarded so. I am now old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in
life, and come to the last stage: my years have turned eighty. Now
suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years’ lifespan,
perfect in mindfulness, retentiveness, memory, and lucidity of
wisdom.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote197anc" HREF="#sdendnote197sym"><SUP>cxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as a skilled archer, trained, practised, and tested, could
easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree, suppose
that they were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness,
retentiveness, [83] memory, and lucidity of wisdom. Suppose that they
continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulness and
that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer
of mine and never asked a subsidiary question or paused except to
eat, drink, consume food, taste, urinate, defecate, and rest in order
to remove sleepiness and tiredness. Still the Tathagata’s
exposition of the Dhamma, his explanations of factors of the Dhamma,
and his replies to questions would not yet come to an end, but
meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years’
lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred years.
Sariputta, even if you have to carry me about on a bed, still there
will be no change in the lucidity of the Tathagata’s wisdom.</P>

“Rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone: ‘A being not

THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed, and taking
their bowls and outer robes, [84] went into Savatthi for alms. Then
they thought: “It is still too early to wander for alms in
Savatthi. Suppose we went to the park of the wanderers of other
sects.” So they went to the park of the wanderers of other sects
and exchanged greetings with the wanderers. When this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, they sat down at one side. The wanderers
said to them:</P>
<P  >3.
“Friends, the recluse Gotama describes the full understanding of
sensual pleasures, and we do so too; the recluse Gotama describes the
full understanding of material form, and we do so too; the recluse
Gotama describes the full understanding of feelings, and we do so
too. What then is the distinction here, friends, what is the
variance, what is the difference between the recluse Gotama’s
teaching of the Dhamma and ours, between his instructions and ours?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote200anc" HREF="#sdendnote200sym"><SUP>cc</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
Then those bhikkhus neither approved nor disapproved of the
wanderers’ words. Without doing either they rose from their seats
and went away, thinking: “We shall come to understand the meaning
of these words in the Blessed One’s presence.”</P>
<P  >5.
When they had wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from
their almsround, after the meal they went to the Blessed One, and
after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him
what had taken place. [The Blessed One said:] [85]</P>
<P  >6.
“Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects who speak thus should be
questioned thus: ‘But, friends, what is the gratification, what is
the danger, and what is the escape in the case of sensual pleasures?
What is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape
in the case of material form? What is the gratification, what is the
danger, and what is the escape in the case of feelings?’ Being
questioned thus, wanderers of other sects will fail to account for
the matter, and what is more, they will get into difficulties. Why is
that? Because it is not their province. Bhikkhus, I see no one in the
world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation
with its recluses and brahmins, with its princes and its people, who
could satisfy the mind with a reply to these questions, except for
the Tathagata or his disciple or one who has learned it from them.</P>
<H3 >(SENSUAL PLEASURES)</H3>
<P  >7.
(i) “And what, bhikkhus, is the gratification in the case of
sensual pleasures? Bhikkhus, there are these five cords of sensual
pleasure. What are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are
wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual
desire, and provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear …
Odours cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.
Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of
sensual pleasure are the gratification in the case of sensual
pleasures.</P>
<P  >8.
(ii) “And what, bhikkhus, is the danger in the case of sensual
pleasures? Here, bhikkhus, on account of the craft by which a
clansman makes a living - whether checking or accounting or
calculating or farming or trading or husbandry or archery or the
royal service, or whatever craft it may be - he has to face cold, he
has to face heat, he is injured by contact with gadflies, mosquitoes,
wind, sun, and creeping things; he risks death by hunger and thirst.
Now this is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of
suffering visible here and now, having sensual pleasures as its
cause, sensual pleasures as its source, sensual pleasures as its
basis, [86] the cause being simply sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >9.
“If no property comes to the clansman while he works and strives
and makes an effort thus, he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps
beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying: ‘My work is in
vain, my effort is fruitless!’ Now this too is a danger in the case
of sensual pleasures … the cause being simply sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >10.
“If property comes to the clansman while he works and strives and
makes an effort thus, he experiences pain and grief in protecting it:
‘How shall neither kings nor thieves make off with my property, nor
fire burn it, nor water sweep it away, nor hateful heirs make off
with it?’ And as he guards and protects his property, kings or
thieves make off with it, or fire burns it, or water sweeps it away,
or hateful heirs make off with it. And he sorrows, grieves, and
laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying:
‘What I had I have no longer!’ Now this too is a danger in the
case of sensual pleasures … the cause being simply sensual
pleasures.</P>
<P  >11.
“Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as
the source, sensual pleasures as the basis, the cause being simply
sensual pleasures, kings quarrel with kings, nobles with nobles,
brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders; mother
quarrels with child, child with mother, father with child, child with
father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with sister, sister
with brother, friend with friend. And here in their quarrels, brawls,
and disputes they attack each other with fists, clods, sticks, or
knives, whereby they incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too is
a danger in the case of sensual pleasures … the cause being simply
sensual pleasures.</P>

the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Mahanama the Sakyan<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote205anc" HREF="#sdendnote205sym"><SUP>ccv</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down
at one side and said: “Venerable sir, I have long understood the
Dhamma taught by the Blessed One thus: ‘Greed is an imperfection
that defiles the mind, hate is an imperfection that defiles the mind,
delusion is an imperfection that defiles the mind.’ Yet while I
understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One thus, at times states
of greed, hate, and delusion invade my mind and remain. I have
wondered, venerable sir, what state is still unabandoned by me
internally, owing to which at times these states of greed, hate, and
delusion invade my mind and remain.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote206anc" HREF="#sdendnote206sym"><SUP>ccvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
“Mahanama, there is still a state unabandoned by you internally,
owing to which at times states of greed, hate, and delusion invade
your mind and remain; for were that state already abandoned by you
internally you would not be living the home life, you would not be
enjoying sensual pleasures.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote207anc" HREF="#sdendnote207sym"><SUP>ccvii</SUP></A></SUP>
It is because that state is unabandoned by you internally that you

“Even though a noble disciple has seen clearly as it actually is
with proper wisdom how sensual pleasures provide little
gratification, much suffering, and much despair, and how great is the
danger in them, as long as he still does not attain to the rapture

pleasures. [92]</P>
<P  >5.
“Before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened
Bodhisatta, I too clearly saw as it actually is with proper wisdom
how sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering,

I still did not attain to the rapture and pleasure that are apart
from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, or to
something more peaceful than that, I recognised that I still could be
attracted to sensual pleasures. But when I clearly saw as it actually

<P  >6-14.
“And what is the gratification in the case of sensual pleasures?
Mahanama, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure … (as
Sutta 13, §§7-15) … Now this too is a danger in the case of
sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering in the life to come, having
sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its source,

<P  >15.
“Now, Mahanama, on one occasion I was living at Rajagaha on the
mountain Vulture Peak. On that occasion a number of Niganthas living
on the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili were practising continuous
standing, rejecting seats, and were experiencing painful, racking,
piercing feelings due to exertion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote209anc" HREF="#sdendnote209sym"><SUP>ccix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >16.
“Then, when it was evening, I rose from meditation and went to the
Niganthas there. I asked them: ‘Friends, why do you practise
continuous standing, rejecting seats, and experience painful,
racking, piercing feelings due to exertion?’</P>
<P  >17.
“When this was said, they replied: ‘Friend, the Nigantha
Nataputta is omniscient and all-seeing and claims to have complete
knowledge and vision thus: “Whether I am walking or standing or
asleep or awake, [93] knowledge and vision are continuously and
uninterruptedly present to me.” He says thus: “Niganthas, you
have done evil actions in the past; exhaust them with the performance
of piercing austerities. And when you are here and now restrained in
body, speech, and mind, that is doing no evil actions for the future.
So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh
actions, there will be no consequence in the future. With no
consequence in the future, there is the destruction of action. With
the destruction of action, there is the destruction of suffering.
With the destruction of suffering, there is the destruction of
feeling. With the destruction of feeling, all suffering will be
exhausted.” This is [the doctrine] we approve of and accept, and we
are satisfied with it.’</P>
<P  >18.
“When this was said, I told them: ‘But, friends, do you know that
you existed in the past, and that it is not the case that you did not
exist?’ - ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But, friends, do you know that you
did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them?’ - ‘No,
friend.’ - ‘But, friends, do you know that you did such and such
evil actions?’ - ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But, friends, do you know
that so much suffering has already been exhausted, or that so much
suffering has still to be exhausted, or that when so much suffering
has been exhausted all suffering will have been exhausted?’ - ‘No,
friend.’ - ‘But, friends, do you know what the abandoning of
unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is
here and now?’ -’No, friend.’</P>
<P  >19.
“‘So, friends, it seems that you do not know that you existed in
the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist; or that
you did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them; or
that you did such and such evil actions; or that so much suffering
has already been exhausted, or that so much suffering has still to be
exhausted, or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all
suffering will have been exhausted; or what the abandoning of
unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is
here and now. That being so, those who are murderers, bloody-handed
evil-doers in the world, when they are reborn among human beings, go
forth into homelessness as Niganthas.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote210anc" HREF="#sdendnote210sym"><SUP>ccx</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“‘Friend Gotama, pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure;
pleasure is to be gained through pain. [94] For were pleasure to be

than the venerable Gotama.’</P>
<P  >“‘Surely
the venerable Niganthas have uttered those words rashly and without

‘No, friend.’ - ‘Can King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha abide
without moving his body or uttering a word, experiencing the peak of
pleasure for six, five, four, three, or two days and nights? … for
one day and night?’ -’No, friend.’</P>

Grove, the Deer Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Friends,

Moggallana said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Friends, though a bhikkhu asks thus: ‘Let the venerable ones
admonish me,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote212anc" HREF="#sdendnote212sym"><SUP>ccxii</SUP></A></SUP>
I need to be admonished by the venerable ones,’ yet if he is
difficult to admonish and possesses qualities that make him difficult
to admonish, if he is impatient and does not take instruction
rightly, then his companions in the holy life think that he should

“Friends, though a bhikkhu does not ask thus: ‘Let the venerable

<P  >“Friends,

“Now, friends, a bhikkhu ought to infer about himself in the
following way:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote215anc" HREF="#sdendnote215sym"><SUP>ccxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >(1)
‘A person with evil wishes and dominated by evil wishes is
displeasing and disagreeable to me. If I were to have evil wishes and
be dominated by evil wishes, I would be displeasing and disagreeable
to others.’ A bhikkhu who knows this should arouse his mind thus:
‘I shall not have evil wishes and be dominated by evil wishes.’</P>
<P  >(2-16)
‘A person who lauds himself and disparages others … [98 ] … A
person who adheres to his own views, holds on to them tenaciously,
and relinquishes them with difficulty is displeasing and disagreeable
to me. If I were to adhere to my own views, hold on to them
tenaciously, and relinquish them with difficulty, I would be
displeasing and disagreeable to others.’ A bhikkhu who knows this
should arouse his mind thus: ‘I shall not adhere to my own views,
hold on to them tenaciously, and I shall relinquish them easily.’</P>
<P  >7.
“Now, friends, a bhikkhu should review himself thus:</P>
<P  >(1)
‘Do I have evil wishes and am I dominated by evil wishes?’ If,
when he reviews himself, he knows: ‘I have evil wishes, I am
dominated by evil wishes,’ then he should make an effort to abandon
those evil unwholesome states. But if, when he reviews himself, he
knows: ‘I have no evil wishes, I am not dominated by evil wishes,’
then he can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome
states.</P>
<P  >(2-16)
Again, a bhikkhu should review himself thus: ‘Do I praise myself
and disparage others?’ … [99] … ‘Do I adhere to my own views,
hold on to them tenaciously, and relinquish them with difficulty?’
If, when he reviews himself, he knows: ‘I adhere to my own views …
,’ then [100] he should make an effort to abandon those evil
unwholesome states. But if, when he reviews himself, he knows: ‘I
do not adhere to my own views … ,’ then he can abide happy and
glad, training day and night in wholesome states.</P>
<P  >8.
“Friends, when a bhikkhu reviews himself thus, if he sees that
these evil unwholesome states are not all abandoned in himself, then
he should make an effort to abandon them all. But if, when he reviews
himself thus, he sees that they are all abandoned in himself, then he

becomes glad thus: ‘It is a gain for me that it is clean’; so too
when a bhikkhu reviews himself thus … then he can abide happy and

18. Madhupindika Sutta - The Honeyball</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Kapilavatthu for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu and had returned from his
almsround, after his meal he went to the Great Wood for the day’s
abiding, and entering the Great Wood, sat down at the root of a bilva
sapling for the day’s abiding.</P>
<P  >3.
Dandapani the Sakyan, while walking and wandering for exercise, also
went to the Great Wood, and when he had entered the Great Wood, he
went to the bilva sapling where the Blessed One was and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he stood at one side leaning on his stick and asked the
Blessed One: “What does the recluse assert, what does he
proclaim?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote226anc" HREF="#sdendnote226sym"><SUP>ccxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
“Friend, I assert and proclaim such [a teaching] that one does not
quarrel with anyone in the world with its gods, its Maras, and its
Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its
princes and its people; such [a teaching] that perceptions no more
underlie that brahmin who abides detached from sensual pleasures,
without perplexity, shorn of worry, free from craving for any kind of
being.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote227anc" HREF="#sdendnote227sym"><SUP>ccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

When this was said, Dandapani the Sakyan shook his head, [109] wagged
his tongue, and raised his eyebrows until his forehead was puckered
in three lines.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote228anc" HREF="#sdendnote228sym"><SUP>ccxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then he departed, leaning on his stick.</P>
<P  >6.
Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and
went to Nigrodha’s Park, where he sat down on a seat made ready for
him and told the bhikkhus what had taken place. Then a certain
bhikkhu asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >7.
“But, venerable sir, what is [the teaching] that the Blessed One
asserts whereby one does not quarrel with anyone in the world with
its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation with its
recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people? And, venerable
sir, how is it that perceptions no more underlie that brahmin who
abides detached from sensual pleasures, without perplexity, shorn of
worry, free from craving for any kind of being?”</P>
<P  >8.
“Bhikkhus, as to the source through which perceptions and notions
tinged by mental proliferation beset a man: if nothing is found there
to delight in, welcome and hold to, this is the end of the underlying
tendency to lust, of the underlying tendency to aversion, [110] of
the underlying tendency to views, of the underlying tendency to
doubt, of the underlying tendency to conceit, of the underlying
tendency to desire for being, of the underlying tendency to
ignorance; this is the end of resorting to rods and weapons, of
quarrels, brawls, disputes, recrimination, malice, and false speech;
here these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote229anc" HREF="#sdendnote229sym"><SUP>ccxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9.
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One
rose from his seat and went into his dwelling.</P>
<P  >10.
Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the bhikkhus considered:
“Now, friends, the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone
into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding
the detailed meaning. Now who will expound this in detail?” Then
they considered: “The venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the
Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote230anc" HREF="#sdendnote230sym"><SUP>ccxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning. Suppose we went to
him and asked him the meaning of this.”</P>
<P  >11.
Then the bhikkhus went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, they sat down to one side and told him what had taken
place, [111] adding: “Let the venerable Maha Kaccana expound it to
us.”</P>
<P  >12.
[The venerable Maha Kaccana replied:] “Friends, it is as though a
man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, thought that heartwood should be sought for among the
branches and leaves of a great tree standing possessed of heartwood,
after he had passed over the root and the trunk. And so it is with
you, venerable sirs, that you think that I should be asked about the
meaning of this, after you passed the Blessed One by when you were
face to face with the Teacher. For knowing, the Blessed One knows;
seeing, he sees; he is vision, he is knowledge, he is the Dhamma, he
is the holy one;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote231anc" HREF="#sdendnote231sym"><SUP>ccxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
he is the sayer, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver
of the Deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the
time when you should have asked the Blessed One the meaning. As he
told you, so you should have remembered it.”</P>
<P  >13.
“Surely, friend Kaccana, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he
sees; he is vision … the Tathagata. That was the time when we
should have asked the Blessed One the meaning. As he told us, so we
should have remembered it. Yet the venerable Maha Kaccana is praised
by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life.
The venerable Maha Kaccana is capable of expounding the detailed
meaning of this summary given in brief by the Blessed One without
expounding the detailed meaning. Let the venerable Maha Kaccana
expound it without finding it troublesome.”</P>
<P  >14.
“Then listen, friends, and attend closely to what I shall say.” -
“Yes, friend,” the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Maha Kaccana
said this:</P>
<P  >15.
“Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his
dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the

of it to be as follows:</P>
<P  >16.
“Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The

“Friends, when the Blessed One [113] rose from his seat and went
into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding
the detailed meaning, that is: ‘Bhikkhus, as to the source through

thus. Now, friends, if you wish, go to the Blessed One and ask him
about the meaning of this. As the Blessed One explains it to you, so
you should remember it.”</P>
<P  >20.
Then the bhikkhus, having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable
Maha Kaccana’s words, rose from their seats and went to the Blessed
One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told
the Blessed One all that had taken place after he had left, adding:
“Then, venerable sir, we went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and
asked him about the meaning. [114] The venerable Maha Kaccana
expounded the meaning to us with these terms, statements, and
phrases.”</P>
<P  >21.
“Maha Kaccana is wise, bhikkhus, Maha Kaccana has great wisdom. If
you had asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to
you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained it. Such is the
meaning of this, and so you should remember it.”</P>

When this was said, the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One:
“Venerable sir, just as if a man exhausted by hunger and weakness

in the course of eating it he would find a sweet delectable flavour;
so too, venerable sir, any able-minded bhikkhu, in the course of

<P  >“As

19. Dvedhavitakka Sutta - Two Kinds of Thought</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an
unenlightened Bodhisatta, it occurred to me: ‘Suppose that I divide
my thoughts into two classes.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote235anc" HREF="#sdendnote235sym"><SUP>ccxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Then I set on one side thoughts of sensual desire, thoughts of ill

non-cruelty.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote236anc" HREF="#sdendnote236sym"><SUP>ccxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, [115] a thought
of sensual desire arose in me. I understood thus: ‘This thought of
sensual desire has arisen in me. This leads to my own affliction, to
others’ affliction, and to the affliction of both; it obstructs
wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from Nibbana.’ When I
considered: ‘This leads to my own affliction,’ it subsided in me;
when I considered: ‘This leads to others’ affliction,’ it
subsided in me; when I considered: ‘This leads to the affliction of
both,’ it subsided in me; when I considered: ‘This obstructs
wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from Nibbana,’ it
subsided in me. Whenever a thought of sensual desire arose in me, I
abandoned it, removed it, did away with it.</P>

“As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of ill

thus: ‘This thought of cruelty has arisen in me. This leads to my
own affliction, to others’ affliction, and to the affliction of
both; it obstructs wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from
Nibbana.’ When I considered thus … it subsided in me. Whenever a
thought of cruelty arose in me, I abandoned it, removed it, did away
with it.</P>
<P  >6.
“Bhikkhus, whatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon,
that will become the inclination of his mind. If he frequently thinks
and ponders upon thoughts of sensual desire, he has abandoned the
thought of renunciation to cultivate the thought of sensual desire,
and then his mind inclines to thoughts of sensual desire. If he
frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of ill will … upon
thoughts of cruelty, he has abandoned the thought of non-cruelty to
cultivate the thought of cruelty, and then his mind inclines to
thoughts of cruelty.</P>
<P  >7.
“Just as in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, when
the crops thicken, a cowherd would guard his cows by constantly
tapping and poking them on this side and that with a stick to check
and curb them. Why is that? Because he sees that he could be flogged,
imprisoned, fined, or blamed [if he let them stray into the crops].
So too I saw in unwholesome states danger, degradation, and
defilement, and in wholesome states the blessing of renunciation, the
aspect of cleansing. [116]</P>
<P  >8.
“As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of
renunciation arose in me. I understood thus: ‘This thought of
renunciation has arisen in me. This does not lead to my own
affliction, or to others’ affliction, or to the affliction of both;
it aids wisdom, does not cause difficulties, and leads to Nibbana. If
I think and ponder upon this thought even for a night, even for a
day, even for a night and day, I see nothing to fear from it. But
with excessive thinking and pondering I might tire my body, and when
the body is tired, the mind becomes disturbed, and when the mind is
disturbed, it is far from concentration.’ So I steadied my mind
internally, quieted it, brought it to singleness, and concentrated
it. Why is that? So that my mind should not be disturbed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote237anc" HREF="#sdendnote237sym"><SUP>ccxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of
non-ill will arose in me … a thought of non-cruelty arose in me. I

This does not lead to my own affliction, or to others’ affliction,
or to the affliction of both; it aids wisdom, does not cause

“Bhikkhus, whatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon,

“Just as in the last month of the hot season, when all the crops
have been brought inside the villages, [117] a cowherd would guard
his cows while staying at the root of a tree or out in the open,
since he needs only to be mindful that the cows are there; so too,
there was need for me only to be mindful that those states were
there.</P>
<P  >13.
“Tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was
established, my body was tranquil and untroubled, my mind
concentrated and unified.</P>
<P  >14-23.
“Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, I entered upon and abided in the first jhana … (as Sutta 4,
§§23-32) … I directly knew: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’</P>
<P  >24.
“This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the third
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute.</P>
<P  >25.
“Suppose, bhikkhus, that in a wooded range there was a great
low-lying marsh near which a large herd of deer lived. Then a man
appeared desiring their ruin, harm, and bondage, and he closed off
the safe and good path that led to their happiness, and he opened up
a false path, and he put out a decoy and set up a dummy so that the
large herd of deer might later come upon calamity, disaster, and
loss. But another man came desiring their good, welfare, and
protection, and he reopened the safe and good path that led to their
happiness, and he closed off the false path, and he removed the decoy
and destroyed the dummy, so that the large herd of deer might later
come to growth, increase, and fulfilment.</P>
<P  >26.
“Bhikkhus, I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning.
[118] This is the meaning: ‘The great low-lying marsh’ is a term
for sensual pleasures. ‘The large herd of deer’ is a term for
beings. ‘The man desiring their ruin, harm, and bondage’ is a
term for Mara the Evil One. ‘The false path’ is a term for the
wrong eightfold path, that is: wrong view, wrong intention, wrong
speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong
mindfulness, and wrong concentration. ‘The decoy’ is a term for
delight and lust. ‘The dummy’ is a term for ignorance. ‘The man
desiring their good, welfare, and protection’ is a term for the
Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened. ‘The safe and good
path that led to their happiness’ is a term for the Noble Eightfold
Path, that is: right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
concentration.</P>
<P  >“So,
bhikkhus, the safe and good path that leads to happiness has been
reopened by me, the wrong path has been closed off, the decoy
removed, the dummy destroyed.</P>
<P  >27.
“What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a
teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I
have done for you, bhikkhus. There are these roots of trees, these
empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not delay or else you will regret
it later. This is our instruction to you.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

20. Vitakkasanthana Sutta - The Removal of Distracting Thoughts</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote238anc" HREF="#sdendnote238sym"><SUP>ccxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s
Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
“Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,” [119] they replied. The
Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is pursuing the higher mind, from time to
time he should give attention to five signs.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote239anc" HREF="#sdendnote239sym"><SUP>ccxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
What are the five?</P>
<P  >3.
(i) “Here, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is giving attention to some
sign, and owing to that sign there arise in him evil unwholesome
thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with delusion, then he
should give attention to some other sign connected with what is
wholesome.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote240anc" HREF="#sdendnote240sym"><SUP>ccxl</SUP></A></SUP>
When he gives attention to some other sign connected with what is
wholesome, then any evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire,
with hate, and with delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With
the abandoning of them his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted,
brought to singleness, and concentrated. Just as a skilled carpenter
or his apprentice might knock out, remove, and extract a coarse peg
by means of a fine one, so too … when a bhikkhu gives attention to
some other sign connected with what is wholesome … his mind becomes
steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated.</P>
<P  >4.
(ii) “If, while he is giving attention to some other sign connected
with what is wholesome, there still arise in him evil unwholesome
thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with delusion, then he
should examine the danger in those thoughts thus: ‘These thoughts
are unwholesome, they are reprehensible, they result in suffering.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote241anc" HREF="#sdendnote241sym"><SUP>ccxli</SUP></A></SUP>
When he examines the danger in those thoughts, then any evil
unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with
delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With the abandoning of
them his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to
singleness, and concentrated. Just as a man or a woman, young,
youthful, and fond of ornaments, would be horrified, humiliated, and
disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being [120]
were hung around his or her neck, so too … when a bhikkhu examines
the danger in those thoughts … his mind becomes steadied
internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and concentrated.</P>
<P  >5.
(iii) “If, while he is examining the danger in those thoughts,
there still arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts connected with
desire, with hate, and with delusion, then he should try to forget
those thoughts and should not give attention to them. When he tries
to forget those thoughts and does not give attention to them, then
any evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and
with delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With the abandoning
of them his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to
singleness, and concentrated. Just as a man with good eyes who did
not want to see forms that had come within range of sight would
either shut his eyes or look away, so too … when a bhikkhu tries to
forget those thoughts and does not give attention to them … his
mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated.</P>
<P  >6.
(iv) “If, while he is trying to forget those thoughts and is not
giving attention to them, there still arise in him evil unwholesome
thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with delusion, then he
should give attention to stilling the thought-formation of those
thoughts.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote242anc" HREF="#sdendnote242sym"><SUP>ccxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
When he gives attention to stilling the thoughtformation of those
thoughts, then any evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire,
with hate, and with delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With
the abandoning of them his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted,
brought to singleness, and concentrated. Just as a man walking fast
might consider: ‘Why am I walking fast? What if I walk slowly?’
and he would walk slowly; then he might consider: ‘Why am I walking
slowly? What if I stand?’ and he would stand; then he might
consider: ‘Why am I standing? What if I sit?’ and he would sit;
then he might consider: ‘Why am I sitting? What if I lie down?’
and he would lie down. By doing so he would substitute for each
grosser posture one that was subtler. So too … when a bhikkhu gives
attention to stilling the thought-formation of those thoughts … his
mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated.</P>
<P  >7.
(v) “If, while he is giving attention to stilling the
thoughtformation of those thoughts, there still arise in him evil
unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with
delusion, then, with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed
against the roof of his mouth, he should beat down, constrain, and
crush mind with mind.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote243anc" HREF="#sdendnote243sym"><SUP>ccxliii</SUP></A></SUP>
[121] When, with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against
the roof of his mouth, he beats down, constrains, and crushes mind
with mind, then any evil unwholesome thoughts connected. with desire,
with hate, and with delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With
the abandoning of them his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted,
brought to singleness, and concentrated. Just as a strong man might
seize a weaker man by the head or shoulders and beat him down,
constrain him, and crush him, so too … when, with his teeth
clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth, a
bhikkhu beats down, constrains, and crushes mind with mind … his
mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated.</P>
<P  >8.
“Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is giving attention to some sign, and
owing to that sign there arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts
connected with desire, with hate, and with delusion, then when he
gives attention to some other sign connected with what is wholesome,
any such evil unwholesome thoughts are abandoned in him and subside,
and with the abandoning of them his mind becomes steadied internally,
quieted, brought to singleness, and concentrated. When he examines
the danger in those thoughts … When he tries to forget those
thoughts and does not give attention to them … When he gives
attention to stilling the thought-formation of those thoughts …
When, with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof
of his mouth, he beats down, constrains, and crushes mind with mind,
any such evil unwholesome thoughts are abandoned in him … and his
mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, [122] brought to
singleness, and concentrated. This bhikkhu is then called a master of
the courses of thought. He will think whatever thought he wishes to
think and he will not think any thought that he does not wish to
think. He has severed craving, flung off the fetters, and with the
complete penetration of conceit he has made an end of suffering.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote244anc" HREF="#sdendnote244sym"><SUP>ccxliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

21. Kakacupama Sutta - The Simile of the Saw</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Moliya Phagguna was associating
overmuch with bhikkhunis.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote245anc" HREF="#sdendnote245sym"><SUP>ccxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
He was associating so much with bhikkhunis that if any bhikkhu spoke
dispraise of those bhikkhunis in his presence, he would become angry
and displeased and would rebuke him; and if any bhikkhu spoke
dispraise of the venerable Moliya Phagguna in those bhikkhunis’
presence, they would become angry and displeased and would rebuke
him. So much was the venerable Moliya Phagguna associating with
bhikkhunis.</P>
<P  >3.
Then a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what
was taking place.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: “Come, [123]
bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhu Moliya Phagguna in my name that the Teacher
calls him.” - “Yes, venerable sir,” he replied, and he went to
the venerable Moliya Phagguna and told him: “The Teacher calls you,
friend Phagguna.” - “Yes, friend,” he replied, and he went to
the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, sat down at one
side. The Blessed One asked him:</P>
<P  >5.
“Phagguna, is it true that you are associating overmuch with
bhikkhunis, that you are associating so much with bhikkhunis that if
any bhikkhu speaks dispraise of those bhikkhunis in your presence,
you become angry and displeased and rebuke him; and if any bhikkhu
speaks dispraise of you in those bhikkhunis’ presence, they become
angry and displeased and rebuke him. Are you associating so much with
bhikkhunis, as it seems?” - “Yes, venerable sir.” - “Phagguna,
are you not a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the home
life into homelessness?” - “Yes, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >6.
“Phagguna, it is not proper for you, a clansman gone forth out of
faith from the home life into homelessness, to associate overmuch
with bhikkhunis. Therefore, if anyone speaks dispraise of those
bhikkhunis in your presence, you should abandon any desires and any
thoughts based on the household life. And herein you should train
thus: ‘My mind will be unaffected, and I shall utter no evil words;
I shall abide compassionate for his welfare, with a mind of
loving-kindness, without inner hate.’ That is how you should train,
Phagguna.</P>
<P  >“If
anyone gives those bhikkhunis a blow with his hand, with a clod, with
a stick, or with a knife in your presence, you should abandon any
desires and any thoughts based on the household life. And herein you
should train thus: ‘My mind will be unaffected … ’ If anyone
speaks dispraise in your presence, you should abandon any desires and
any thoughts based on the household life. And herein you should train
thus: ‘My mind will be unaffected … ’ If anyone should give you
a blow with his hand, with a clod, with a stick, or with a knife,
[124] you should abandon any desires and any thoughts based on the
household life. And herein you should train thus: ‘My mind will be
unaffected, and I shall utter no evil words; I shall abide
compassionate for his welfare, with a mind of loving-kindness,
without inner hate.’ That is how you should train, Phagguna.</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, there
was an occasion when the bhikkhus satisfied my mind. Here I addressed
the bhikkhus thus: ‘Bhikkhus, I eat at a single session. By so
doing, I am free from illness and affliction, and I enjoy health,
strength, and a comfortable abiding. Come, bhikkhus, eat at a single
session. By so doing, you will be free from illness and affliction,
and you will enjoy health, strength, and a comfortable abiding.’
And I had no need to keep on instructing those bhikkhus; I had only
to arouse mindfulness in them.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote246anc" HREF="#sdendnote246sym"><SUP>ccxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Suppose there were a chariot on even ground at the crossroads,
harnessed to thoroughbreds, waiting with goad lying ready, so that a
skilled trainer, a charioteer of horses to be tamed, might mount it,
and taking the reins in his left hand and the goad in his right hand,
might drive out and back by any road whenever he likes. So too, I had
no need to keep on instructing those bhikkhus; I had only to arouse
mindfulness in them.</P>
<P  >8.
“Therefore, bhikkhus, abandon what is unwholesome and devote
yourselves to wholesome states, for that is how you will come to
growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline.
Suppose there were a big sala-tree grove near a village or town, and
it was choked with castor-oil weeds, and some man would appear
desiring its good, welfare, and protection. He would cut down and
throw out the crooked saplings that robbed the sap, and he would
clean up the interior of the grove and tend the straight well-formed
saplings, so that the sala-tree grove later on would come to growth,
increase, and fulfilment. So too, bhikkhus, abandon what is
unwholesome and devote yourselves to wholesome states, [125] for that
is how you will come to growth, increase, and fulfilment in this
Dhamma and Discipline.</P>
<P  >9.
“Formerly, bhikkhus, in this same Savatthi there was a housewife
named Vedehika. And a good report about Mistress Vedehika had spread
thus: ‘Mistress Vedehika is kind, Mistress Vedehika is gentle,
Mistress Vedehika is peaceful.’ Now Mistress Vedehika had a maid
named Kali, who was clever, nimble, and neat in her work. The maid
Kali thought: ‘A good report about my lady has spread thus:
“Mistress Vedehika is kind, Mistress Vedehika is gentle, Mistress
Vedehika is peaceful.” How is it now, while she does not show
anger, is it nevertheless actually present in her or is it absent? Or
else is it just because my work is neat that my lady shows no anger
though it is actually present in her? Suppose I test my lady.’</P>
<P  >“So
the maid Kali got up late. The Mistress Vedehika said: ‘Hey, Kali!’
- ‘What is it, madam?’ - ‘What is the matter that you get up so
late?’ - ‘Nothing is the matter, madam.’ - ‘Nothing is the
matter, you wicked girl, yet you get up so late!’ and she was angry
and displeased, and she scowled. Then the maid Kali thought: ‘The
fact is that while my lady does not show anger, it is actually
present in her, not absent; and it is just because my work is neat
that my lady shows no anger though it is actually present in her, not
absent. Suppose I test my lady a little more.’</P>
<P  >“So
the maid Kali got up later in the day. Then Mistress Vedehika said:
‘Hey, Kali!’ - ‘What is it, madam?’ - ‘What is the matter
that you get up later in the day?’ -’Nothing is the matter,
madam.’ - ‘Nothing is the matter, you wicked girl, yet you get up
later in the day!’ and she was angry and displeased, and she spoke
words of displeasure. Then the maid Karl thought: ‘The fact is that
while my lady does not show anger, it is actually present in her, not
absent. Suppose I test my lady a little more.’</P>
<P  >“So
the maid Karl got up still later in the day. Then Mistress Vedehika
[126] said: ‘Hey, Kali!’ -’What is it, madam?’ -’What is
the matter that you get up still later in the day?’ - ‘Nothing is
the matter, madam.’ - ‘Nothing is the matter, you wicked girl,
yet you get up still later in the day!’ and she was angry and
displeased, and she took a rolling-pin, gave her a blow on the head,
and cut her head.</P>
<P  >“Then
the maid Kali, with blood running from her cut head, denounced her
mistress to the neighbours: ‘See, ladies, the kind lady’s work!
See, ladies, the gentle lady’s work! See, ladies, the peaceful
lady’s work! How can she become angry and displeased with her only
maid for getting up late? How can she take a rolling-pin, give her a
blow on the head, and cut her head?’ Then later on a bad report
about Mistress Vedehika spread thus: ‘Mistress Vedehika is rough,
Mistress Vedehika is violent, Mistress Vedehika is merciless.’</P>
<P  >10.
“So too, bhikkhus, some bhikkhu is extremely kind, extremely
gentle, extremely peaceful, so long as disagreeable courses of speech
do not touch him. But it is when disagreeable courses of speech touch
him that it can be understood whether that bhikkhu is really kind,
gentle, and peaceful. I do not call a bhikkhu easy to admonish who is
easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only for the sake
of getting robes, almsfood, a resting place, and medicinal
requisites. Why is that? Because that bhikkhu is not easy to admonish
nor makes himself easy to admonish when he gets no robes, almsfood,
resting place, and medicinal requisites. But when a bhikkhu is easy
to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish because he honours,
respects, and reveres the Dhamma, him I call easy to admonish.
Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train thus: ‘We shall be easy to
admonish and make ourselves easy to admonish because we honour,
respect, and revere the Dhamma.’ That is how you should train,
bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >11.
“Bhikkhus, there are these five courses of speech that others may
use when they address you: their speech may be timely or untimely,
true or untrue, gentle or harsh, connected with good or with harm,
spoken with a mind of loving-kindness or with inner hate. When others
address you, their speech may be timely or untimely; when others
address you, their speech may be true or untrue; when others address
you, their speech may be gentle or harsh; when others address you,
their speech may be connected with good [127] or with harm; when
others address you, their speech may be spoken with a mind of
loving-kindness or with inner hate. Herein, bhikkhus, you. should
train thus: ‘Our minds will remain unaffected, and we shall utter
no evil words; we shall abide compassionate for their welfare, with a
mind of loving-kindness, without inner hate. We shall abide pervading
that person with a mind imbued with lovingkindness, and starting with
him,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote247anc" HREF="#sdendnote247sym"><SUP>ccxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
we shall abide pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind
imbued with lovingkindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility and without ill will.’ That is how you should train,
bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >12.
“Bhikkhus, suppose a man came with a hoe and a basket and said: ‘I
shall make this great earth to be without earth.’ He would dig here
and there, strew the soil here and there, spit here and there, and
urinate here and there, saying: ‘Be without earth, be without
earth!’ What do you think, bhikkhus? Could that man make this great
earth to be without earth?” - “No, venerable sir. Why is that?
Because this great earth is deep and immense; it cannot possibly be
made to be without earth. Eventually the man would reap only
weariness and disappointment.”</P>
<P  >13.
“So too, bhikkhus, there are these five courses of speech … (as
in §11) … Herein, bhikkhus, you should train thus: ‘Our minds
will remain unaffected … and starting with him, we shall abide
pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind similar to the
earth, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without
ill will.’ That is how you should train, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >14.
“Bhikkhus, suppose a man came with crimson, turmeric, indigo, or
carmine and said: ‘I shall draw pictures and make pictures appear
on empty space.’ What do you think, bhikkhus? Could that man draw
pictures and make pictures appear on empty space?” - “No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because empty space is formless and
invisible; he cannot possibly draw pictures there or make pictures
appear there. [128] Eventually the man would reap only weariness and
disappointment.”</P>
<P  >15.
“So too, bhikkhus, there are these five courses of speech …
Herein, bhikkhus, you should train thus: ‘Our minds will remain
unaffected … and starting with him, we shall abide pervading the
all-encompassing world with a mind similar to empty space, abundant,
exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will.’
That is how you should train, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >16.
“Bhikkhus, suppose a man came with a blazing grass-torch and said:
‘I shall heat up and burn away the river Ganges with this blazing
grass-torch.’ What do you think, bhikkhus? Could that man heat up
and burn away the river Ganges with that blazing grass-torch?” -
“No, venerable sir. Why is that? Because the river Ganges is deep
and immense; it cannot possibly be heated up and burned away with a
blazing grass-torch. Eventually the man would reap only weariness and
disappointment.”</P>
<P  >17.
“So too, bhikkhus, there are these five courses of speech …
Herein, bhikkhus, you should train thus: ‘Our minds will remain
unaffected … and starting with him, we shall abide pervading the
all-encompassing world with a mind similar to the river Ganges,
abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill
will.’ That is how you should train, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >18.
“Bhikkhus, suppose there were a catskin bag that was rubbed,
well-rubbed, thoroughly well-rubbed, soft, silky, rid of rustling,
rid of crackling, and a man came with a stick or a potsherd and said:
‘There is this catskin bag that is rubbed … rid of rustling, rid
of crackling. I shall make it rustle and crackle.’ What do you
think, bhikkhus? Could that man make it rustle or crackle with the
stick or the potsherd?” - “No, venerable sir. Why is that?
Because that catskin bag being rubbed … rid of rustling, rid of
crackling, cannot possibly be made to rustle or crackle with the
stick or the potsherd. Eventually the man would reap only weariness
and disappointment.”</P>
<P  >19.
“So too, bhikkhus, there are these five courses of speech that
others may use when they address you: their speech may be timely
[129] or untimely, true or untrue, gentle or harsh, connected with
good or with harm, spoken with a mind of lovingkindness or with inner
hate. When others address you, their speech may be timely or
untimely; when others address you, their speech may be true or
untrue; when others address you, their speech may be gentle or harsh;
when others address you, their speech may be connected with good or
with harm; when others address you, their speech may be spoken with a
mind of loving-kindness or with inner hate. Herein, bhikkhus, you
should train thus: ‘Our minds will remain unaffected, and we shall
utter no evil words; we shall abide compassionate for their welfare,
with a mind of loving-kindness, without inner hate. We shall abide
pervading that person with a mind imbued with loving-kindness; and
starting with him, we shall abide pervading the all-encompassing
world with a mind similar to a catskin bag, abundant, exalted,
immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will.’ That is how
you should train, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >20.
“Bhikkhus, even if bandits were to sever you savagely limb by limb
with a two-handled saw, he who gave rise to a mind of hate towards
them would not be carrying out my teaching. Herein, bhikkhus, you
should train thus: ‘Our minds will remain unaffected, and we shall
utter no evil words; we shall abide compassionate for their welfare,
with a mind of lovingkindness, without inner hate. We shall abide
pervading them with a mind imbued with loving-kindness; and starting
with them, we shall abide pervading the all-encompassing world with a
mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable,
without hostility and without ill will.’ That is how you should
train, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >21.
“Bhikkhus, if you keep this advice on the simile of the saw
constantly in mind, do you see any course of speech, trivial or
gross, that you could not endure?” - “No, venerable sir.” -
“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should keep this advice on the simile of
the saw constantly in mind. That will lead to your welfare and
happiness for a long time.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

22. Alagaddupama Sutta - The Simile of the Snake (SETTING)</H2>
<P  >[130]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote248anc" HREF="#sdendnote248sym"><SUP>ccxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One</P>
<P  >was
living at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named
Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, thus: “As I understand
the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things called
obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who
engages in them.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote249anc" HREF="#sdendnote249sym"><SUP>ccxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Several bhikkhus, having heard about this, went to the bhikkhu
Arittha and asked him: “Friend Arittha, is it true that such a
pernicious view has arisen in you?”</P>
<P  >“Exactly
so, friends. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One,
those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to
obstruct one who engages in them.”</P>
<P  >Then
these bhikkhus, desiring to detach him from that pernicious view,
pressed and questioned and cross-questioned him thus: “Friend
Arittha, do not say so. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is
not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not
speak thus. For in many discourses the Blessed One has stated how
obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to
obstruct one who engages in them. The Blessed One has stated how
sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering, and
much despair, and how great is the danger in them. With the simile of
the skeleton … with the simile of the piece of meat … with the
simile of the grass torch … with the simile of the pit of coals …
with the simile of the dream … with the simile of the borrowed
goods … with the simile of the tree laden with fruit … with the
simile of the slaughterhouse … with the simile of the sword stake …
with the simile of the snake’s head, the Blessed One has stated how
sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering, and
much despair, and how great is the danger in them.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote250anc" HREF="#sdendnote250sym"><SUP>ccl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Yet
although pressed and questioned and cross-questioned by them in this
way, the bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, still
obstinately adhered to that pernicious view and continued to insist
upon it.</P>
<P  >4.
Since the bhikkhus were unable to detach him [131] from that
pernicious view, they went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him all that had
occurred, adding: “Venerable sir, since we could not detach the
bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers, from this
pernicious view, we have reported this matter to the Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: “Come,
bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers,
in my name that the Teacher calls him.” - [132] “Yes, venerable
sir,” he replied, and he went to the bhikkhu Arittha and told him:
“The Teacher calls you, friend Arittha.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
friend,” he replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One then
asked him: “Arittha, is it true that the following pernicious view
has arisen in you: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the
Blessed One, those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are
not able to obstruct one who engages in them’?’</P>
<P  >“Exactly
so, venerable sir. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed
One, those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able
to obstruct one who engages in them.”</P>
<P  >6.
“Misguided man, to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma
in that way? Misguided man, in many discourses have I not stated how
obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to
obstruct one who engages in them? I have stated how sensual pleasures
provide little gratification, much suffering, and much despair, and
how great is the danger in them. With the simile of the skeleton …
with the simile of the piece of meat … with the simile of the grass
torch … with the simile of the pit of coals … with the simile of
the dream … with the simile of the borrowed goods … with the
simile of the tree laden with fruit … with the simile of the
slaughterhouse … with the simile of the sword stake … with the
simile of the snake’s head, I have stated how sensual pleasures
provide little gratification, much suffering, and much despair, and
how great is the danger in them. But you, misguided man, have
misrepresented us by your wrong grasp and injured yourself and stored
up much demerit; for this will lead to your harm and suffering for a
long time.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote251anc" HREF="#sdendnote251sym"><SUP>ccli</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, what
do you think? Has this bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture
killers, kindled even a spark of wisdom in this Dhamma and
Discipline?”</P>
<P  >“How
could he, venerable sir? No, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the bhikkhu Arittha, formerly of the vulture killers,
sat silent, dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum,
and without response. Then, knowing this, the Blessed One told him:
“Misguided man, you will be recognised by your own pernicious view.
I shall question the bhikkhus on this matter.”</P>
<P  >8.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, [133]
do you understand the Dhamma taught by me as this bhikkhu Arittha,
formerly of the vulture killers, does when he misrepresents us by his
wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. For in many discourses the Blessed One has stated how
obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to
obstruct one who engages in them. The Blessed One has stated how
sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering, and
much despair, and how great is the danger in them. With the simile of
the skeleton … with the simile of the snake’s head, the Blessed
One has stated … how great is the danger in them.”</P>
<P  >“Good,
bhikkhus. It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me
thus. For in many discourses I have stated how obstructive things are
obstructions, and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in
them. I have stated how sensual pleasures provide little
gratification, much suffering, and much despair, and how great is the
danger in them. With the simile of the skeleton … with the simile

misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up
much demerit; for this will lead to this misguided man’s harm and
suffering for a long time.</P>

they do not examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Not
examining the meaning of those teachings with wisdom, they do not

being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of

Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes, venerable
sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhus,
suppose a man in the course of a journey saw a great expanse of
water, whose near shore was dangerous and fearful and whose further
shore was safe and free from fear, but there was no ferryboat or
bridge going to the far shore. [135] Then he thought: ‘There is
this great expanse of water, whose near shore is dangerous and
fearful and whose further shore is safe and free from fear, but there
is no ferryboat or bridge going to the far shore. Suppose I collect
grass, twigs, branches, and leaves and bind them together into a
raft, and supported by the raft and making an effort with my hands
and feet, I got safely across to the far shore.’ And then the man
collected grass, twigs, branches, and leaves and bound them together
into a raft, and supported by the raft and making an effort with his
hands and feet, he got safely across to the far shore. Then, when he
had got across and had arrived at the far shore, he might think thus:
‘This raft has been very helpful to me, since supported by it and
making an effort with my hands and feet, I got safely across to the
far shore. Suppose I were to hoist it on my head or load it on my
shoulder, and then go wherever I want.’ Now, bhikkhus, what do you
think? By doing so, would that man be doing what should be done with
that raft?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“By
doing what would that man be doing what should be done with that
raft? Here, bhikkhus, when that man got across and had arrived at the
far shore, he might think thus: ‘This raft has been very helpful to
me, since supported by it and making an effort with my hands and
feet, I got safely across to the far shore. Suppose I were to haul it
onto the dry land or set it adrift in the water, and then go wherever
I want.’ Now, bhikkhus, it is by so doing that that man would be
doing what should be done with that raft. So I have shown you how the
Dhamma is similar to a raft, being for the purpose of crossing over,
not for the purpose of grasping.</P>

And this standpoint for views, namely, ‘This is self, this the

<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. Now on that

<P  >Then,
when the night was well advanced, a certain deity of beautiful

approached the venerable Kumara Kassapa and stood at one side.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote276anc" HREF="#sdendnote276sym"><SUP>cclxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
So standing, the deity said to him:</P>

“Bhikkhu, bhikkhu, this ant-hill fumes by night and flames by day.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote277anc" HREF="#sdendnote277sym"><SUP>cclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Thus

with the knife, the wise one saw a bar: ‘A bar, O venerable sir.’</P>
<P  >“Thus
spoke the brahmin: ‘Throw out the bar; delve with the knife, thou

<P  >“Thus
spoke the brahmin: ‘Throw out the toad; delve with the knife, thou

<P  >“Bhikkhu,
you should go to the Blessed One and ask him about this riddle. As
the Blessed One tells you, so should you remember it. Bhikkhu, other
than the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata or one who has
learned it from them, I see no one in this world with its gods, its
Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and
brahmins, its princes and its people, whose explanation of this
riddle might satisfy the mind.”</P>
<P  >That
is what was said by the deity, who thereupon vanished at once.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when the night was over, the venerable Kumara Kassapa went to
the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side
and told the Blessed One what had occurred. Then he asked: “Venerable
sir, what is the ant-hill, what the fuming by night, what the flaming
by day? Who is the brahmin, who the wise one? What is the knife, what
the delving, what the bar, what the toad, what the fork, what the
sieve, what the tortoise, what the axe and block, what the piece of
meat, what the Naga serpent?” [144]</P>
<P  >4.
“Bhikkhu, the ant-hill is a symbol for this body, made of material

day is the ‘fuming by night.’</P>
<P  >“The
actions one undertakes during the day by body, speech, and mind after
thinking and pondering by night is the ‘flaming by day.’</P>
<P  >“The
brahmin is a symbol for the Tathagata, accomplished and fully
enlightened. The wise one is a symbol for a bhikkhu in higher
training. The knife is a symbol for noble wisdom. The delving is a
symbol for the arousing of energy.</P>
<P  >“The

‘Throw out the bar: abandon ignorance. Delve with the knife, thou

<P  >“The
toad is a symbol for the despair due to anger. ‘Throw out the toad:
abandon despair due to anger. Delve with the knife, thou wise one.’
This is the meaning.</P>
<P  >“The
fork is a symbol for doubt.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote280anc" HREF="#sdendnote280sym"><SUP>cclxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
‘Throw out the fork: abandon doubt. Delve with the knife, thou wise

<P  >“The
sieve is a symbol for the five hindrances, namely, the hindrance of
sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the hindrance of sloth and
torpor, the hindrance of restlessness and remorse, and the hindrance
of doubt. ‘Throw out the sieve: abandon the five hindrances. Delve
with the knife, thou wise one.’ This is the meaning.</P>
<P  >“The

namely, the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling
aggregate affected by clinging, the perception aggregate affected by

consciousness aggregate affected by clinging. ‘Throw out the

<P  >“The

- forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and
provocative of lust; sounds cognizable by the ear … odours

tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire, [145] and
provocative of lust. ‘Throw out the axe and block: abandon the five

This is the meaning.</P>
<P  >“The

‘Throw out the piece of meat: abandon delight and lust. Delve with

<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Kumara Kassapa was
satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading25"  >
24. Rathavinita Sutta - The Relay Chariots</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Then a number of bhikkhus from [the Blessed One’s] native land,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote285anc" HREF="#sdendnote285sym"><SUP>cclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
who had spent the Rains there, went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One asked
them: “Bhikkhus, who in [my] native land is esteemed by the
bhikkhus there, by his companions in the holy life, in this way:
‘Having few wishes himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on fewness of
wishes; content himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on contentment;
secluded himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on seclusion; aloof from
society himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on aloofness from society;
energetic himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on arousing energy;
attained to virtue himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on the
attainment of virtue; attained to concentration himself, he talks to
the bhikkhus on the attainment of concentration; attained to wisdom
himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on the attainment of wisdom;
attained to deliverance himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on the
attainment of deliverance; attained to the knowledge and vision of
deliverance himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on the attainment of
the knowledge and vision of deliverance;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote286anc" HREF="#sdendnote286sym"><SUP>cclxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
he is one who advises, informs, instructs, urges, [146] rouses, and
encourages his companions in the holy life’?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, the venerable Punna Mantaniputta is so esteemed in the [Blessed
One’s] native land by the bhikkhus there, by his companions in the
holy life.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote287anc" HREF="#sdendnote287sym"><SUP>cclxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was seated near the
Blessed One. Then it occurred to the venerable Sariputta: “It is a
gain for the venerable Punna Mantaniputta, it is a great gain for him
that his wise companions in the holy life praise him point by point
in the Teacher’s presence. Perhaps sometime or other we might meet
the venerable Punna Mantaniputta and have some conversation with
him.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then, when the Blessed One had stayed at Rajagaha as long as he
chose, he set out to wander by stages to Savatthi. Wandering by
stages, he eventually arrived at Savatthi, and there he lived in
Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >5.
The venerable Punna Mantaniputta heard: “The Blessed One has
arrived at Savatthi and is living in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s
Park.” Then the venerable Punna Mantaniputta set his resting place
in order, and taking his outer robe and bowl, set out to wander by
stages to Savatthi. Wandering by stages, he eventually arrived at
Savatthi and went to Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park, to see
the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down
at one side and the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged him with talk on the Dhamma. Then the venerable Punna
Mantaniputta, instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by the
Blessed One’s talk on the Dhamma, delighting and rejoicing in the
Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to
the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he went to the Blind Men’s
Grove for the day’s abiding.</P>
<P  >6.
Then a certain bhikkhu went to the venerable Sariputta and said to
him: “Friend Sariputta, the bhikkhu Punna Mantaniputta of whom you
have always spoken highly [147] has just been instructed, urged,
roused, and encouraged by the Blessed One with talk on the Dhamma;
after delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One’s words, he rose
from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping
him on his right, he has gone to the Blind Men’s Grove for the
day’s abiding.”</P>
<P  >7.
Then the venerable Sariputta quickly picked up a mat and followed
close behind the venerable Punna Mantaniputta, keeping his head in
sight. Then the venerable Punna Mantaniputta entered the Blind Men’s
Grove and sat down for the day’s abiding at the root of a tree. The
venerable Sariputta also entered the Blind Men’s Grove and sat down
for the day’s abiding at the root of a tree.</P>
<P  >8.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Sariputta rose from
meditation, went to the venerable Punna Mantaniputta, and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said to the venerable Punna
Mantaniputta:</P>
<P  >9.
“Is the holy life lived under our Blessed One, friend?” - “Yes,
friend.” - “But, friend, is it for the sake of purification of
virtue that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One?” - “No,
friend.” - “Then is it for the sake of purification of mind that
the holy life is lived under the Blessed One?” - “No, friend.”
- “Then is it for the sake of purification of view that the holy
life is lived under the Blessed One?” - “No, friend.” - “Then
is it for the sake of purification by overcoming doubt that the holy
life is lived under the Blessed One?” - “No, friend.” - “Then
is it for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of what is
the path and what is not the path that the holy life is lived under
the Blessed One?” - “No, friend.” - “Then is it for the sake
of purification by knowledge and vision of the way that the holy life
is lived under the Blessed One?” - “No, friend.” - “Then is
it for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision that the holy

<P  >10.
“Friend, when asked: ‘But, friend, is it for the sake of
purification of virtue that the holy life is lived under the Blessed
One?’ you replied: ‘No, friend.’ When asked: ‘Then is it for
the sake of purification of mind … purification of view …
purification by overcoming doubt … purification by knowledge and
vision of what is the path and what is not the path … purification
by knowledge and vision of the way … purification by knowledge and
vision that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One?’ you
replied: ‘No, friend.’ For the sake of what then, friend, [148]
is the holy life lived under the Blessed One?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
it is for the sake of final Nibbana without clinging that the holy
life is lived under the Blessed One.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote289anc" HREF="#sdendnote289sym"><SUP>cclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
“But, friend, is purification of virtue final Nibbana without
clinging?” - “No, friend.” - “Then is purification of mind
final Nibbana without clinging?” - “No, friend.” - “Then is
purification of view final Nibbana without clinging?” - “No,
friend.” - “Then is purification by overcoming doubt final
Nibbana without clinging?” - “No, friend.” - “Then is
purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is
not the path final Nibbana without clinging?” - “No, friend.” -
“Then is purification by knowledge and vision of the way final
Nibbana without clinging?” - “No, friend.” - “Then is
purification by knowledge and vision final Nibbana without clinging?”
- “No, friend.” - “But, friend, is final Nibbana without
clinging to be attained without these states?” - “No, friend.”</P>
<P  >12.
“When asked: ‘But, friend, is purification of virtue final
Nibbana without clinging?’ you replied: ‘No, friend.’ When
asked: ‘Then is purification of mind … purification of view …
purification by overcoming doubt … purification by knowledge and
vision of what is the path and what is not the path … purification
by knowledge and vision of the way … purification by knowledge and
vision final Nibbana without clinging?’ you replied: ‘No,
friend.’ And when asked: ‘But, friend, is final Nibbana without
clinging to be attained without these states?’ you replied: ‘No,
friend.’ But how, friend, should the meaning of these statements be
regarded?”</P>
<P  >13.
“Friend, if the Blessed One had described purification of virtue as
final Nibbana without clinging, he would have described what is still
accompanied by clinging as final Nibbana without clinging. If the
Blessed One had described purification of mind … purification of
view … purification by overcoming doubt … purification by
knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path …
purification by knowledge and vision of the way … purification by
knowledge and vision as final Nibbana without clinging, he would have
described what is still accompanied by clinging as final Nibbana
without clinging.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote290anc" HREF="#sdendnote290sym"><SUP>ccxc</SUP></A></SUP>
And if final Nibbana without clinging were to be attained without
these states, then an ordinary person would have attained final
Nibbana, for an ordinary person is without these states.</P>
<P  >14.
“As to that, friend, I shall give you a simile, for some wise men
understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile. Suppose
that King Pasenadi of Kosala while living at Savatthi [149] had some
urgent business to settle at Saketa, and that between Savatthi and
Saketa seven relay chariots were kept ready for him. Then King
Pasenadi of Kosala, leaving Savatthi through the inner palace door,
would mount the first relay chariot, and by means of the first relay
chariot he would arrive at the second relay chariot; then he would
dismount from the first chariot and mount the second chariot, and by
means of the second chariot, he would arrive at the third chariot …
by means of the third chariot, he would arrive at the fourth chariot
… by means of the fourth chariot, he would arrive at the fifth
chariot … by means of the fifth chariot, he would arrive at the
sixth chariot … by means of the sixth chariot, he would arrive at
the seventh chariot, and by means of the seventh chariot he would
arrive at the inner palace door in Saketa. Then, when he had come to
the inner palace door, his friends and acquaintances, his kinsmen and
relatives, would ask him: ‘Sire, did you come from Savatthi to the
inner palace door in Saketa by means of this relay chariot?’ How
then should King Pasenadi of Kosala answer in order to answer
correctly?”</P>
<P  >“In
order to answer correctly, friend, he should answer thus: ‘Here,
while living at Savatthi I had some urgent business to settle at
Saketa, and between Savatthi and Saketa seven relay chariots were
kept ready for me. Then, leaving Savatthi through the inner palace
door, I mounted the first relay chariot, and by means of the first
relay chariot I arrived at the second relay chariot; then I
dismounted from the first chariot and mounted the second chariot, and
by means of the second chariot I arrived at the third … fourth …
fifth … sixth … seventh chariot, and by means of the seventh
chariot I arrived at the inner palace door in Saketa.’ In order to
answer correctly he should answer thus.”</P>
<P  >15.
“So too, friend, purification of virtue is for the sake of reaching
purification of mind; purification of mind is for the sake of
reaching purification of view; purification of view is for the sake
of reaching purification by overcoming doubt; purification by
overcoming doubt [150] is for the sake of reaching purification by
knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path;
purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is
not the path is for the sake of reaching purification by knowledge
and vision of the way; purification by knowledge and vision of the
way is for the sake of reaching purification by knowledge and vision;
purification by knowledge and vision is for the sake of reaching
final Nibbana without clinging. It is for the sake of final Nibbana
without clinging that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >16.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta asked the venerable Punna
Mantaniputta: “What is the venerable one’s name, and how do his
companions in the holy life know the venerable one?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote291anc" HREF="#sdendnote291sym"><SUP>ccxci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“My

<P  >“It
is wonderful, friend, it is marvellous! Each profound question has
been answered, point by point, by the venerable Punna Mantaniputta as
a learned disciple who understands the Teacher’s Dispensation
correctly. It is a gain for his companions in the holy life, it is a
great gain for them that they have the opportunity to see and honour
the venerable Punna Mantaniputta. Even if it were by carrying the
venerable Punna Mantaniputta about on a cushion on their heads that
his companions in the holy life would get the opportunity to see and
honour him, it would be a gain for them, a great gain for them. And
it is a gain for us, a great gain for us that we have the opportunity
to see and honour the venerable Punna Mantaniputta.”</P>
<P  >17.
When this was said, the venerable Punna Mantaniputta asked the
venerable Sariputta: “What is the venerable one’s name, and how
do his companions in the holy life know the venerable one?”</P>
<P  >“My
name is Upatissa, friend, and my companions in the holy life know me
as Sariputta.”</P>
<P  >“Indeed,
friend, we did not know that we were talking with the venerable
Sariputta, the disciple who is like the Teacher himself.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote292anc" HREF="#sdendnote292sym"><SUP>ccxcii</SUP></A></SUP>
If we had known that this was the venerable Sariputta, we should not
have said so much. It is wonderful, friend, it is marvellous! Each
profound question has been posed, point by point, by the venerable
Sariputta as a learned disciple who understands the Teacher’s
Dispensation correctly. It is a gain for his companions in the holy

see and honour the venerable Sariputta. Even if it were by carrying
the venerable Sariputta about on a cushion on their heads that his
companions in the holy life would get the opportunity to see and

And it is a gain for us, a great gain for us that we have the

intending thus: ‘May the deer herd enjoy this bait that I have laid
down and so be long-lived and handsome and endure for a long time.’
A deer-trapper lays down bait for a deer herd intending thus: ‘The
deer herd will eat food unwarily by going right in amongst the bait
that I have laid down; by so doing they will become intoxicated; when
they are intoxicated, they will fall into negligence; when they are
negligent, I can do with them as I like on account of this bait.’</P>
<P  >3.
“Now the deer of the first herd ate food unwarily by going right in
amongst the bait that the deer-trapper had laid down; by so doing
they became intoxicated; when they were intoxicated, they fell into
negligence; when they were negligent, the deertrapper did with them
as he liked on account of that bait. That is how the deer of the
first herd failed to get free from the deertrapper’s power and
control.</P>
<P  >4.
“Now the deer of a second herd reckoned thus: ‘The deer of that
first herd, by acting as they did without precaution, [152] failed to
get free from the deer-trapper’s power and control. Suppose we
altogether shun that bait food; shunning that fearful enjoyment, let
us go out into the forest wilds and live there.’ And they did so.
But in the last month of the hot season when the grass and the water
were used up, their bodies were reduced to extreme emaciation; with
that they lost their strength and energy; when they had lost their
strength and energy, they returned to that same bait that the
deer-trapper had laid down.</P>
<P  >They
ate food unwarily by going right in amongst it. By so doing they
became intoxicated; when they were intoxicated they fell into
negligence; when they were negligent, the deer-trapper did with them
as he liked on account of that bait. And that is how the deer of the
second herd also failed to get free from the deer-trapper’s power
and control.</P>
<P  >5.
“Now the deer of a third herd reckoned thus: ‘The deer of that
first herd, by acting as they did without precaution, failed to get
free from the deer-trapper’s power and control. The deer of that
second herd, by reckoning how the deer of the first herd had failed
and by planning and acting as they did with the precaution of going
to live in the forest wilds, also failed to get free from the
deer-trapper’s power and control. Suppose we make our dwelling
place within range of the deer-trapper’s bait. [153] Then, having
done so, we shall eat food not unwarily and without going right in
amongst the bait that the deer-trapper has laid down; by doing so we
shall not become intoxicated; when we are not intoxicated, we shall
not fall into negligence; when we are not negligent, the deer-trapper
shall not do with us as he likes on account of that bait.’ And they
did so.</P>
<P  >“But
then the deer-trapper and his following considered thus: ‘These
deer of this third herd are as cunning and crafty as wizards and
sorcerers. They eat the bait laid down without our knowing how they
come and go. Suppose we have the bait that is laid down completely
surrounded all round over a wide area with wicker hurdles; then
perhaps we might see the third deer herd’s dwelling place, where
they go to hide.’ They did so, and they saw the third herd’s
dwelling place, where they went to hide. And that is how the deer of
the third herd also failed to get free from the deer-trapper’s
power and control.</P>
<P  >6.
“Now the deer of a fourth herd reckoned thus: ‘The deer of that
first herd, by acting as they did without precaution, failed to get
free from the deer-trapper’s power and control. The deer of that
second herd, by reckoning how the deer of the first herd had failed
and by planning and acting as they did with the precaution of going
to live in the forest wilds, also failed to get free from the
deer-trapper’s power and control. And the deer of that third herd,
by reckoning how the deer of the first herd [154] and also the deer
of the second herd had failed, and by planning and acting as they did
with the precaution of making their dwelling place within range of
the deer-trapper’s bait, also failed to get free from the
deer-trapper’s power and control. Suppose we make our dwelling
place where the deer-trapper and his following cannot go. Then,
having done so, we shall eat food not unwarily and without going
right in amongst the bait that the deer-trapper has laid down; by
doing so we shall not become intoxicated; when we are not

herd’s dwelling place, where they went to hide. Then the
deer-hunter and his following considered thus: ‘If we scare the
fourth deer herd, being scared they will alert others, and so the
deer herds will all desert this bait that we have laid down. Suppose
we treat the fourth deer herd with indifference.’ They did so. And
that was how the deer of the fourth deer herd got free from the
deer-trapper’s power and control.</P>

“Bhikkhus, I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning.
This is the meaning: ‘Bait’ is a term for the five cords of
sensual pleasure. ‘Deer-trapper’ is a term for Mara the Evil One.
‘The deer-trapper’s following’ is a term for Mara’s
following. ‘Deer herd’ is a term for recluses and brahmins.</P>
<P  >8.
“Now recluses and brahmins of the first kind ate food unwarily by
going right in amongst the bait and the material things of the world
that Mara had laid down; [156] by so doing they became intoxicated;

There they were eaters of greens or millet or wild rice or

On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s
Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. Then a number of
bhikkhus went to the venerable Ananda and said to him: “Friend
Ananda, it is long since we heard a talk on the Dhamma from the
Blessed One’s own lips. It would be good if we could get to hear
such a talk, friend Ananda.” - “Then let the venerable ones go to
the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage. Perhaps you will get to hear a
talk on the Dhamma from the Blessed One’s own lips.” - “Yes,
friend,” they replied.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when the Blessed One had wandered for alms in Savatthi and had
returned from his almsround, after his meal he addressed the
venerable Ananda: “Ananda, let us go to the Eastern Park, to the
Palace of Migara’s Mother, for the day’s abiding.” - “Yes,
venerable sir,” the venerable Ananda replied. [161] Then the
Blessed One went with the venerable Ananda to the Eastern Park, the
Palace of Migara’s Mother, for the day’s abiding.</P>
<P  >Then,
when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and
addressed the venerable Ananda: “Ananda, let us go to the Eastern
Bathing Place to bathe.” - “Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable
Ananda replied. Then the Blessed One went with the venerable Ananda
to the Eastern Bathing Place to bathe. When he was finished, he came
up out of the water and stood in one robe drying his limbs. Then the
venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the
brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage is nearby. That hermitage is agreeable
and delightful. Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One
went there out of compassion.” The Blessed One consented in
silence.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One went to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage. Now
on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were sitting together in the
hermitage discussing the Dhamma. The Blessed One stood outside the
door waiting for their discussion to end. When he knew that it was
over, he coughed and knocked, and the bhikkhus opened the door for
him. The Blessed One entered, sat down on a seat made ready, and
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, for what discussion are you
sitting together here now? And what was your discussion that was
interrupted?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, our discussion on the Dhamma that was interrupted was about the
Blessed One himself. Then the Blessed One arrived.”</P>
<P  >“Good,
bhikkhus. It is fitting for you clansmen who have gone forth out of
faith from the home life into homelessness to sit together to discuss
the Dhamma. When you gather together, bhikkhus, you should do either
of two things: hold discussion on the Dhamma or maintain noble
silence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote298anc" HREF="#sdendnote298sym"><SUP>ccxcviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >TWO KINDS OF SEARCH</H3>

“Bhikkhus, there are these two kinds of search: the noble search
and the ignoble search. And what is the ignoble search? Here someone
being himself subject to birth seeks what is also subject to birth;
being himself subject to ageing, [162] he seeks what is also subject
to ageing; being himself subject to sickness, he seeks what is also
subject to sickness; being himself subject to death, he seeks what is
also subject to death; being himself subject to sorrow, he seeks what
is also subject to sorrow; being himself subject to defilement, he
seeks what is also subject to defilement.</P>
<P  >6.
“And what may be said to be subject to birth? Wife and children are
subject to birth, men and women slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and
pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, gold and silver are
subject to birth. These objects of attachment<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote299anc" HREF="#sdendnote299sym"><SUP>ccxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
are subject to birth; and one who is tied to these things, infatuated
with them, and utterly committed to them, being himself subject to
birth, seeks what it also subject to birth.</P>
<P  >7.
“And what may be said to be subject to ageing? Wife and children
are subject to ageing, men and women slaves, goats and sheep, fowl
and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, gold and silver are

“And what may be said to be subject to death? Wife and children are

pigs, elephants, cattle, horses, and mares are subject to death.
These objects of attachment are subject to death; and one who is tied
to these things, infatuated with them, and utterly committed to them,

infatuated with them, and utterly committed to them, being himself
subject to defilement, seeks what is also subject to defilement. This
is the ignoble search.</P>
<P  >12.
“And what is the noble search? Here someone being himself subject
to birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth,
[163] seeks the unborn supreme security from bondage, Nibbana; being
himself subject to ageing, having understood the danger in what is

<H3 >(THE SEARCH FOR ENLIGHTENMENT)</H3>
<P  >13.
“Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an
unenlightened Bodhisatta, I too, being myself subject to birth,
sought what was also subject to birth; being myself subject to
ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, I sought what was
also subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement. Then
I considered thus: ‘Why, being myself subject to birth, do I seek
what is also subject to birth? Why, being myself subject to ageing,
sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, do I seek what is also
subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement? Suppose
that, being myself subject to birth, having understood the danger in
what is subject to birth, I seek the unborn supreme security from
bondage, Nibbana. Suppose that, being myself subject to ageing,
sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, having understood the danger
in what is subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and
defilement, I seek the unageing, unailing, deathless, sorrowless, and
undefiled supreme security from bondage, Nibbana.’</P>
<P  >14.
“Later, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with
the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, though my mother and
father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces, I shaved off my
hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and went forth from the home
life into homelessness.</P>
<P  >15.
“Having gone forth, bhikkhus, in search of what is wholesome,
seeking the supreme state of sublime peace, I went to Alara Kalama
and said to him: ‘Friend Kalama, I want to lead the holy life in
this Dhamma and Discipline.’ Alara Kalama replied: ‘The venerable
one may stay here. This Dhamma is such that a wise man [164] can soon
enter upon and abide in it, realising for himself through direct
knowledge his own teacher’s doctrine.’ I soon quickly learned
that Dhamma. As far as mere lip-reciting and rehearsal of his
teaching went, I could speak with knowledge and assurance, and I
claimed, ‘I know and see’ - and there were others who did
likewise.</P>
<P  >“I
considered: ‘It is not through mere faith alone that Alara Kalama
declares: “By realising for myself with direct knowledge, I enter
upon and abide in this Dhamma.” Certainly Alara Kalama abides
knowing and seeing this Dhamma.’ Then I went to Alara Kalama and
asked him: ‘Friend Kalama, in what way do you declare that by
realising for yourself with direct knowledge you enter upon and abide
in this Dhamma?’ In reply he declared the base of nothingness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote301anc" HREF="#sdendnote301sym"><SUP>ccci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“I
considered: ‘Not only Alara Kalama has faith, energy, mindfulness,
concentration, and wisdom. I too have faith, energy, mindfulness,
concentration, and wisdom. Suppose I endeavour to realise the Dhamma
that Alara Kalama declares he enters upon and abides in by realising
for himself with direct knowledge?’</P>
<P  >“I
soon quickly entered upon and abided in that Dhamma by realising for
myself with direct knowledge. Then I went to Alara Kalama and asked
him: ‘Friend Kalama, is it in this way that you declare that you
enter upon and abide in this Dhamma by realising for yourself with
direct knowledge?’ -’That is the way, friend.’ - ‘It is in
this way, friend, that I also enter upon and abide in this Dhamma by
realising for myself with direct knowledge.’ - ‘It is a gain for
us, friend, it is a great gain for us that we have such a venerable
one for our companion in the holy life. So the Dhamma that I declare
I enter upon and abide in by realising for myself with direct
knowledge is the Dhamma that you enter upon and abide in by realising
for yourself with direct knowledge. [165] And the Dhamma that you
enter upon and abide in by realising for yourself with direct

that I know and I know the Dhamma that you know. As I am, so are you;
as you are, so am I. Come, friend, let us now lead this community
together.’</P>
<P  >“Thus
Alara Kalama, my teacher, placed me, his pupil, on an equal footing
with himself and awarded me the highest honour. But it occurred to
me: ‘This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to
cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to
Nibbana, but only to reappearance in the base of nothingness.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote302anc" HREF="#sdendnote302sym"><SUP>cccii</SUP></A></SUP>
Not being satisfied with that Dhamma, I left it and went away.</P>
<P  >16.
“Still in search, bhikkhus, of what is wholesome, seeking the
supreme state of sublime peace, I went to Uddaka Ramaputta and said

In reply Uddaka Ramaputta declared the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</P>
<P  >“I
considered: ‘Not only Rama had faith, [166] energy, mindfulness,
concentration, and wisdom. I too have faith, energy, mindfulness,
concentration, and wisdom. Suppose I endeavour to realise the Dhamma
that Rama declared he entered upon and abided in by realising for

<P  >“I
soon quickly entered upon and abided in that Dhamma by realising for

asked him: ‘Friend, was it in this way that Rama declared that he

direct knowledge?’ - ‘That is the way, friend.’ - ‘It is in

us, friend, it is a great gain for us that we have such a venerable

<P  >“Thus
Uddaka Ramaputta, my companion in the holy life, placed me in the
position of a teacher and accorded me the highest honour. But it
occurred to me: ‘This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana, but only to reappearance in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.’ Not being satisfied with
that Dhamma, I left it and went away.</P>
<P  >17.
“Still in search, bhikkhus, of what is wholesome, seeking the
supreme state of sublime peace, I wandered by stages through the
Magadhan country until eventually I arrived at Senanigama near
Uruvela. [167] There I saw an agreeable piece of ground, a delightful
grove with a clear-flowing river with pleasant, smooth banks and
nearby a village for alms resort. I considered: ‘This is an
agreeable piece of ground, this is a delightful grove with a
clear-flowing river with pleasant, smooth banks and nearby a village
for alms resort. This will serve for the striving of a clansman
intent on striving.’ And I sat down there thinking: ‘This will
serve for striving.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote304anc" HREF="#sdendnote304sym"><SUP>ccciv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(ENLIGHTENMENT)</H3>
<P  >18.
“Then, bhikkhus, being myself subject to birth, having understood
the danger in what is subject to birth, seeking the unborn supreme
security from bondage, Nibbana, I attained the unborn supreme
security from bondage, Nibbana; being myself subject to ageing,
having understood the danger in what is subject to ageing, seeking
the unageing supreme security from bondage, Nibbana, I attained the
unageing supreme security from bondage, Nibbana; being myself subject
to sickness, having understood the danger in what is subject to
sickness, seeking the</P>
<P  >unailing
supreme security from bondage, Nibbana, I attained the unailing
supreme security from bondage, Nibbana; being myself subject to
death, having understood the danger in what is subject to death,
seeking the deathless supreme security from bondage, Nibbana, I
attained the deathless supreme security from bondage, Nibbana; being
myself subject to sorrow, having understood the danger in what is
subject to sorrow, seeking the sorrowless supreme security from
bondage, Nibbana, I attained the sorrowless supreme security from
bondage, Nibbana; being myself subject to defilement, having
understood the danger in what is subject to defilement, seeking the
undefiled supreme security from bondage, Nibbana, I attained the
undefiled supreme security from bondage, Nibbana. The knowledge and
vision arose in me: ‘My deliverance is unshakeable; this is my last
birth; now there is no renewal of being.’</P>
<P  >19.
“I considered: ‘This Dhamma that I have attained is profound,
hard to see and hard to understand, peaceful and sublime,
unattainable by mere reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by the
wise.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote305anc" HREF="#sdendnote305sym"><SUP>cccv</SUP></A></SUP>
But this generation delights in worldliness, takes delight in
worldliness, rejoices in worldliness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote306anc" HREF="#sdendnote306sym"><SUP>cccvi</SUP></A></SUP>
It is hard for such a generation to see this truth, namely, specific
conditionality, dependent origination. And it is hard to see this
truth, namely, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of
all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation,
Nibbana. [168] If I were to teach the Dhamma, others would not
understand me, and that would be wearying and troublesome for me.’
Thereupon there came to me spontaneously these stanzas never heard
before:</P>
<P >
‘Enough with teaching the Dhamma</P>
<P >
That even I found hard to reach;</P>
<P >
For it will never be perceived</P>
<P >
By those who live in lust and hate.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Those dyed in lust, wrapped in darkness</P>
<P >
Will never discern this abstruse Dhamma</P>
<P >
Which goes against the worldly stream,</P>
<P >
Subtle, deep, and difficult to see.’</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >Considering
thus, my mind inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the
Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote307anc" HREF="#sdendnote307sym"><SUP>cccvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >20.
“Then, bhikkhus, the Brahma Sahampati knew with his mind the
thought in my mind and he considered: ‘The world will be lost, the
world will perish, since the mind of the Tathagata, accomplished and
fully enlightened, inclines to inaction rather than to teaching the
Dhamma.’ Then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his
flexed arm or flex his extended arm, the Brahma Sahampati vanished in
the Brahma-world and appeared before me. He arranged his upper robe
on one shoulder, and extending his hands in reverential salutation
towards me, said: ‘Venerable sir, let the Blessed One teach the
Dhamma, let the Sublime One teach the Dhamma. There are beings with
little dust in their eyes who are wasting through not hearing the
Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma.’ The
Brahma Sahampati spoke thus, and then he said further:</P>
<P >
‘In Magadha there have appeared till now</P>
<P >
Impure teachings devised by those still stained.</P>
<P >
Open the doors to the Deathless!</P>
<P >
Let them hear The Dhamma that the Stainless One has found.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Just as one who stands on a mountain peak</P>
<P >
Can see below the people all around,</P>
<P >
So, O Wise One, All-seeing Sage,</P>
<P >
Ascend the palace of the Dhamma.</P>
<P >
Let the Sorrowless One survey this human breed,</P>
<P >
Engulfed in sorrow, overcome by birth and old age. [169]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Arise, victorious hero, caravan leader,</P>

<P >
Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma,</P>
<P >
There will be those who will understand.’</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >21.
“Then I listened to the Brahma’s pleading, and out of compassion
for beings I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha. Surveying
the world with the eye of a Buddha, I saw beings with little dust in
their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with keen faculties and
with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy
to teach and hard to teach, and some who dwelt seeing fear in blame
and in the other world. Just as in a pond of blue or red or white
lotuses, some lotuses</P>
<P  >that
are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without
rising out of it, and some other lotuses that are born and grow in
the water rest on the water’s surface, and some other lotuses that
are born and grow in the water rise out of the water and stand clear,
unwetted by it; so too, surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha,
I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in
their eyes, with keen faculties and with dull faculties, with good
qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach,
and some who dwelt seeing fear in blame and in the other world. Then
I replied to the Brahma Sahampati in stanzas:</P>
<P >
‘Open for them are the doors to the Deathless,</P>
<P >
Let those with ears now show their faith.</P>
<P >
Thinking it would be troublesome,</P>
<P >
O Brahma, I did not speak the Dhamma subtle and sublime.’</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >Then
the Brahma Sahampati thought: ‘I have created the opportunity for
the Blessed One to teach the Dhamma.’ And after paying homage to
me, keeping me on the right, he thereupon departed at once.</P>
<P  >22.
“I considered thus: ‘To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who
will understand this Dhamma quickly?’ It then occurred to me:
‘Alara Kalama is wise, intelligent, and discerning; he has long had
little dust in his eyes. Suppose I [170] taught the Dhamma first to
Alara Kalama. He will understand it quickly.’ Then deities
approached me and said: ‘Venerable sir, Alara Kalama died seven
days ago.’ And the knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘Alara
Kalama died seven days ago.’ I thought: ‘Alara Kalama’s loss is
a great one. If he had heard this Dhamma, he would have understood it
quickly.’</P>
<P  >23.
“I considered thus: ‘To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who
will understand this Dhamma quickly?’ It then occurred to me:
‘Uddaka Ramaputta is wise, intelligent, and discerning; he has long
had little dust in his eyes. Suppose I taught the Dhamma first to
Uddaka Ramaputta. He will understand it quickly.’ Then deities
approached me and said: ‘Venerable sir, Uddaka Ramaputta died last
night.’ And the knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘Uddaka
Ramaputta died last night.’ I thought: ‘Uddaka Ramaputta’s loss
is a great one. If he had heard this Dhamma, he would have understood
it quickly.’</P>
<P  >24.
“I considered thus: ‘To whom should I first teach the Dhamma? Who

engaged in my striving were very helpful.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote308anc" HREF="#sdendnote308sym"><SUP>cccviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Suppose I taught the Dhamma first to them.’ Then I thought: ‘Where
are the bhikkhus of the group of five now living?’ And with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw that
they were living at Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana.</P>

“Then, bhikkhus, when I had stayed at Uruvela as long as I chose, I
set out to wander by stages to Benares. Between Gaya and the Place of
Enlightenment the Ajivaka Upaka saw me on the road and said: ‘Friend,
your faculties are clear, the colour of your skin is pure and bright.
Under whom have you gone forth, friend? Who is your teacher? Whose
Dhamma do you [171] profess?’ I replied to the Ajivaka Upaka in

<P  >“When

Shaking his head, he took a bypath and departed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote310anc" HREF="#sdendnote310sym"><SUP>cccx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >26.
“Then, bhikkhus, wandering by stages, I eventually came to Benares,
to the Deer Park at Isipatana, and I approached the bhikkhus of the
group of five. The bhikkhus saw me coming in the distance, and they
agreed among themselves thus: ‘Friends, here comes the recluse
Gotama who lives luxuriously, who gave up his striving, and reverted
to luxury. We should not pay homage to him or rise up for him or
receive his bowl and outer robe. But a seat may be prepared for him.
If he likes, he may sit down.’ However, as I approached, those
bhikkhus found themselves unable to keep their pact. One came to meet
me and took my bowl and outer robe, another prepared a seat, and
another set out water for my feet; however, they addressed me by name
and as ‘friend.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote311anc" HREF="#sdendnote311sym"><SUP>cccxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >27.
“Thereupon I told them: ‘Bhikkhus, do not address the Tathagata
by name and as “friend.” The Tathagata is an Accomplished One,
[172] a Fully Enlightened One. Listen, bhikkhus, the Deathless has
been attained. I shall instruct you, I shall teach you the Dhamma.
Practising as you are instructed, by realising for yourselves here
and now through direct knowledge you will soon enter upon and abide
in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen
rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness.’</P>
<P  >“When
this was said, the bhikkhus of the group of five answered me thus:
‘Friend Gotama, by the conduct, the practice, and the performance
of austerities that you undertook, you did not achieve any superhuman
states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble
ones.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote312anc" HREF="#sdendnote312sym"><SUP>cccxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Since you now live luxuriously, having given up your striving and
reverted to luxury, how will you have achieved any superhuman states,
any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones?’
When this was said, I told them: ‘The Tathagata does not live
luxuriously, nor has he given up his striving and reverted to luxury.
The Tathagata is an Accomplished One, a Fully Enlightened One.
Listen, bhikkhus, the Deathless has been attained … from the home
life into homelessness.’</P>
<P  >“A
second time the bhikkhus of the group of five said to me: ‘Friend
Gotama … how will you have achieved any super human states, any
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones?’ A
second time I told them: ‘The Tathagata does not live luxuriously …
from the home life into homelessness.’ A third time the bhikkhus of
the group of five said to me: ‘Friend Gotama … how will you have
achieved any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and
vision worthy of the noble ones?’</P>
<P  >28.
“When this was said I asked them: ‘Bhikkhus, have you ever known
me to speak like this before?’ - ‘No, venerable sir.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote313anc" HREF="#sdendnote313sym"><SUP>cccxiii</SUP></A></SUP>

What are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>

“As to those recluses and brahmins who are tied to these five cords
of sensual pleasure, infatuated with them and utterly committed to
them, and who use them without seeing the danger in them or
understanding the escape from them, it may be understood of them:
‘They have met with calamity, met with disaster, the Evil One may

So too, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from

On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s

Now on that occasion the brahmin Janussoni was driving out of
Savatthi in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by
white mares. He saw the wanderer Pilotika coming in the distance and
asked him: “Now where is Master Vacchayana coming from in the
middle of the day?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote320anc" HREF="#sdendnote320sym"><SUP>cccxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Sir,

“Sir, suppose a wise elephant woodsman were to enter an elephant
wood and were to see in the elephant wood [176] a big elephant’s
footprint, long in extent and broad across. He would come to the
conclusion: ‘Indeed, this is a big bull elephant.’ So too, when I
saw four footprints of the recluse Gotama, I came to the conclusion:
‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well
proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha is practising the good
way.’ What are the four?</P>
<P  >4.
“Sir, I have seen here certain learned nobles who were clever,
knowledgeable about the doctrines of others, as sharp as
hairsplitting marksmen; they wander about, as it were, demolishing
the views of others with their sharp wits. When they hear: ‘The
recluse Gotama will visit such and such a village or town,’ they
formulate a question thus: ‘We will go to the recluse Gotama and
ask him this question. If he is asked like this, he will answer like
this, and so we will refute his doctrine in this way; and if he is
asked like that, he will answer like that, and so we will refute his
doctrine in that way.’</P>
<P  >“They
hear: ‘The recluse Gotama has come to visit such and such a village
or town.’ They go to the recluse Gotama, and the recluse Gotama
instructs, urges, rouses, and encourages them with a talk on the
Dhamma. After they have been instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged by the recluse Gotama with a talk on the Dhamma, they do
not so much as ask him the question, so how should they refute his
doctrine? In actual fact, they become his disciples. When I saw this
first footprint of the recluse Gotama, I came to the conclusion: ‘The
Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by
the Blessed One, the Sangha is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >5.
“Again, I have seen certain learned brahmins who were clever … In
actual fact, they too become his disciples. When I saw this second
footprint of the recluse Gotama, I came to the conclusion: ‘The

<P  >6.
“Again, I have seen certain learned householders who were clever …
[177] … In actual fact, they too become his disciples. When I saw
this third footprint of the recluse Gotama, I came to the conclusion:
‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened … ’</P>
<P  >7.
“Again, I have seen certain learned recluses who were clever …
They do not so much as ask him the question, so how should they
refute his doctrine? In actual fact, they ask the recluse Gotama to
allow them to go forth from the home life into homelessness, and he
gives them the going forth. Not long after they have gone forth,
dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, by
realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now
enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the
sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into
homelessness. They say thus: ‘We were very nearly lost, we very
nearly perished, for formerly we claimed that we were recluses though
we were not really recluses; we claimed that we were brahmins through
we were not really brahmins; we claimed that we were arahants though
we were not really arahants. But now we are recluses, now we are
brahmins, now we are arahants.’ When I saw this fourth footprint of
the recluse Gotama, I came to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is
fully enlightened … ’</P>

When this was said, the brahmin Janussoni got down from his all-white
chariot drawn by white mares, and arranging his upper robe on one
shoulder, he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards the
Blessed One and uttered this exclamation three times: “Honour to
the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened! Honour to the
Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened! Honour to the
Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened! Perhaps some time or
other [178] we might meet Master Gotama and have some conversation
with him.”</P>
<P  >9.
Then the brahmin Janussoni went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and related to the Blessed One his
entire conversation with the wanderer Pilotika. Thereupon the Blessed
One told him: “At this point, brahmin, the simile of the elephant’s
footprint has not yet been completed in detail. As to how it is
completed in detail, listen and attend carefully to what I shall
say.” - “Yes, sir,” the brahmin Janussoni replied. The Blessed
One said this:</P>
<P  >10.
“Brahmin, suppose an elephant woodsman were to enter an elephant
wood and were to see in the elephant wood a big elephant’s
footprint, long in extent and broad across. A wise elephant woodsman
would not yet come to the conclusion: ‘Indeed, this is a big bull
elephant.’ Why is that? In an elephant wood there are small
she-elephants that leave a big footprint, and this might be one of
their footprints. He follows it and sees in the elephant wood a big
elephant’s footprint, long in extent and broad across, and some
scrapings high up. A wise elephant woodsman would not yet come to the
conclusion: ‘Indeed, this is a big bull elephant.’ Why is that?
In an elephant wood there are tall she-elephants that have prominent
teeth and leave a big footprint, and this might be one of their
footprints. He follows it further and sees in the elephant wood a big
elephant’s footprint, long in extent and broad across, and some
scrapings high up, and marks made by tusks. A wise elephant woodsman
would not yet come to the conclusion: ‘Indeed, this is a big bull
elephant.’ Why is that? In an elephant wood there are tall
sheelephants that have tusks and leave a big footprint, and this
might be one of their footprints. He follows it further and sees in
the elephant wood a big elephant’s footprint, long in extent and
broad across, and some scrapings high up, and marks made by tusks,
and broken-off branches. And he sees that bull elephant at the root
of a tree or in the open, walking about, sitting, or lying down. He
comes to the conclusion: ‘This is that big bull elephant.’</P>
<P  >11.
“So too, [179] brahmin, here a Tathagata appears in the world,
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He
declares this world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this
generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its
people, which he has himself realised with direct knowledge. He
teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning, good in the middle, and
good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals
a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure.</P>
<P  >12.
“A householder or householder’s son or one born in some other
clan hears that Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in
the Tathagata. Possessing that faith, he considers thus: ‘Household
life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not
easy, while living in a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect
and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard,
put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into
homelessness.’ On a later occasion, abandoning a small or a large
fortune, abandoning a small or a large circle of relatives, he shaves
off his hair and beard, puts on the yellow robe, and goes forth from
the home life into homelessness.</P>
<P  >13.
“Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhu’s training and
way of life, abandoning the killing of living beings, he abstains
from killing living beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gentle
and kindly, he abides compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning
the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not
given; taking only what is given, expecting only what is given, by
not stealing he abides in purity. Abandoning incelibacy, he observes
celibacy, living apart, abstaining from the vulgar practice of sexual
intercourse.</P>
<P  >“Abandoning
false speech, he abstains from false speech; he speaks truth, adheres
to truth, is trustworthy and reliable, one who is no deceiver of the
world. Abandoning malicious speech, he abstains from malicious
speech; he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order
to divide [those people] from these, nor does he repeat to these
people what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people]
from those; thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a
promoter of friendships, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord,
delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord.
Abandoning harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks
such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to
the heart, are courteous, desired by many [180] and agreeable to
many. Abandoning gossip, he abstains from gossip; he speaks at the
right time, speaks what is fact, speaks on what is good, speaks on
the Dhamma and the Discipline; at the right time he speaks such words
as are worth recording, reasonable, moderate, and beneficial.</P>
<P  >“He
abstains from injuring seeds and plants. He practises eating only in
one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and outside the
proper time.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote321anc" HREF="#sdendnote321sym"><SUP>cccxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
He abstains from dancing, singing, music, and theatrical shows. He
abstains from wearing garlands, smartening himself with scent, and
embellishing himself with unguents. He abstains from high and large
couches. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He abstains from
accepting raw grain. He abstains from accepting raw meat. He abstains
from accepting women and girls. He abstains from accepting men and
women slaves. He abstains from accepting goats and sheep. He abstains
from accepting fowl and pigs. He abstains from accepting elephants,
cattle, horses, and mares. He abstains from accepting fields and
land. He abstains from going on errands and running messages. He
abstains from buying and selling. He abstains from false weights,
false metals, and false measures. He abstains from cheating,
deceiving, defrauding, and trickery. He abstains from wounding,
murdering, binding, brigandage, plunder, and violence.</P>
<P  >14.
“He becomes content with robes to protect his body and with
almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes, he sets out
taking only these with him. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies
with its wings as its only burden, so too the bhikkhu becomes content
with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his
stomach, and wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these with
him. Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue, he experiences within
himself a bliss that is blameless.</P>
<P  >15.
“On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its signs and
features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil
unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he
practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he
undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote322anc" HREF="#sdendnote322sym"><SUP>cccxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
On hearing a sound with the ear … On smelling an odour with the
nose … On tasting a flavour with the tongue … On touching a
tangible with the body … On cognizing a mind-object with the mind,
he does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the
mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and
grief might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, [181]
he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind
faculty. Possessing this noble restraint of the faculties, he
experiences within himself a bliss that is unsullied.</P>
<P  >16.
“He becomes one who acts in full awareness when going forward and
returning; who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking
away; who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his
limbs; who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying
his outer robe and bowl; who acts in full awareness when eating,
drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts in full awareness
when defecating and urinating; who acts in full awareness when
walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and
keeping silent.</P>
<P  >17.
“Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue, and this noble
restraint of the faculties, and possessing this noble mindfulness and
full awareness, he resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest,
the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel
ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.</P>
<P  >18.
“On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down,
folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing
mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he
abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from
covetousness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote323anc" HREF="#sdendnote323sym"><SUP>cccxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind free from ill
will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies
his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning sloth and torpor, he
abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of light, mindful and
fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and torpor. Abandoning
restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated with a mind inwardly
peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse.
Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed
about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.</P>
<P  >19.
“Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. This, brahmin, is called
a footprint of the Tathagata, something scraped by the Tathagata,
something marked by the Tathagata, but a noble disciple does not yet
come to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the
Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha is
practising the good way.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote324anc" HREF="#sdendnote324sym"><SUP>cccxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >20.
“Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has
self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. This too,
brahmin, is called a footprint of the Tathagata … but a noble [182]
disciple does not yet come to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is
fully enlightened … ’</P>
<P  >21.
“Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu abides
in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure
with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on
account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding
who has equanimity and is mindful.’ This too, brahmin, is called a
footprint of the Tathagata … but a noble disciple does not yet come
to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened … ’</P>
<P  >22.
“Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana, which has neitherpain-nor-pleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. This too, brahmin, is called
a footprint of the Tathagata … but a noble disciple does not yet
come to the conclusion: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened … ’</P>
<P  >23.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one
birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten
births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a
hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many
aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of worldexpansion, many aeons
of world-contraction and expansion: … (as Sutta 4, §27) … Thus
with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past
lives. This too, brahmin, is called a footprint of the Tathagata …

“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing,
inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. He
understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus: …
(as Sutta 4, §29) … Thus with the divine eye, which is purified

<P  >25.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. He understands as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’;
… ’This is the origin of suffering’; … ’This is the
cessation of suffering’; … ’This is the way leading to the
cessation of suffering’; … ’These are the taints’; … ’This
is the origin of the taints’; … ’This is the cessation of the

taints.’</P>
<P  >“This
too, brahmin, is called a footprint of the Tathagata, something
scraped by the Tathagata, something marked by the Tathagata, but a
noble disciple still has not yet come to the conclusion: ‘The
Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by

is in the process of coming to this conclusion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote325anc" HREF="#sdendnote325sym"><SUP>cccxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >26.
“When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, [184] from the taint of being, and from the taint
of ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It
is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’</P>
<P  >“This

And it is at this point, brahmin, that the simile of the elephant’s

<P  >27.
When this was said, the brahmin Janussoni said to the Blessed One:
“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today
let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
for refuge for life.”</P>

28. Mahahatthipadopama Sutta - The Greater Discourse on the Simile of
the Elephant’s Footprint</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote327anc" HREF="#sdendnote327sym"><SUP>cccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s
Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There the venerable Sariputta
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Friends, bhikkhus.” - “Friend,”
they replied. The venerable Sariputta said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Friends, just as the footprint of any living being that walks can
be placed within an elephant’s footprint, and so the elephant’s
footprint is declared the chief of them because of its great size; so
too, all wholesome states can be included in the Four Noble Truths.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote328anc" HREF="#sdendnote328sym"><SUP>cccxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
In what four? In the noble truth of suffering, [185] in the noble
truth of the origin of suffering, in the noble truth of the cessation
of suffering, and in the noble truth of the way leading to the
cessation of suffering.</P>
<P  >3.
“And what is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering,
ageing is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair are suffering; not to obtain what one wants is
suffering; in short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are
suffering.</P>
<P  >4.
“And what are the five aggregates affected by clinging? They are:
the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling
aggregate affected by clinging, the perception aggregate affected by
clinging, the formations aggregate affected by clinging, and the
consciousness aggregate affected by clinging.</P>
<P  >5.
“And what is the material form aggregate affected by clinging? It
is the four great elements and the material form derived from the
four great elements. And what are the four great elements? They are
the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air
element.</P>
<H3 >(THE EARTH ELEMENT)</H3>
<P  >6.
“What, friends, is the earth element? The earth element may be
either internal or external. What is the internal earth element?
Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, and
clung-to; that is, head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,
sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen,
lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach,
feces, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is solid,
solidified, and clung-to: this is called the internal earth element.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote329anc" HREF="#sdendnote329sym"><SUP>cccxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element
are simply earth element.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote330anc" HREF="#sdendnote330sym"><SUP>cccxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus:
‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ When one
sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes
disenchanted with the earth element and makes the mind dispassionate
toward the earth element.</P>
<P  >7.
“Now there comes a time when the water element is disturbed and
then the external earth element vanishes.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote331anc" HREF="#sdendnote331sym"><SUP>cccxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
When even this external earth element, great as it is, is seen to be
impermanent, subject to destruction, disappearance, and change, what
of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while?
There can be no considering that as ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I
am.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote332anc" HREF="#sdendnote332sym"><SUP>cccxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
“So then, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass a bhikkhu [who
has seen this element as it actually is], he understands thus: ‘This
painful feeling born of ear-contact has arisen in me. That is
dependent, not independent. Dependent on what? [186] Dependent on
contact.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote333anc" HREF="#sdendnote333sym"><SUP>cccxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then he sees that contact is impermanent, that feeling is
impermanent, that perception is impermanent, that formations are
impermanent, and that consciousness is impermanent. And his mind,
having made an element its objective support, enters into [that new
objective support] and acquires confidence, steadiness, and
decision.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote334anc" HREF="#sdendnote334sym"><SUP>cccxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9.
“Now, if others attack that bhikkhu in ways that are unwished for,
undesired, and disagreeable, by contact with fists, clods, sticks, or
knives, he understands thus: ‘This body is of such a nature that
contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives assail it.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote335anc" HREF="#sdendnote335sym"><SUP>cccxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
But this has been said by the Blessed One in his “advice on the
simile of the saw”: “Bhikkhus, even if bandits</P>
<P  >were
to sever you savagely limb by limb with a two-handled saw, he who
gave rise to a mind of hate towards them would not be carrying out my
teaching.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote336anc" HREF="#sdendnote336sym"><SUP>cccxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
So tireless energy shall be aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness
established, my body shall be tranquil and untroubled, my mind
concentrated and unified. And now let contact with fists, clods,
sticks, and knives assail this body; for this is just how the
Buddha’s teaching is practised.’</P>
<P  >10.
“When that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the
Sangha, if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become
established in him, then he arouses a sense of urgency thus: ‘It is
a loss for me, it is no gain for me, it is bad for me, it is no good
for me, that when I thus recollect the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the
Sangha, equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become
established in me.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote337anc" HREF="#sdendnote337sym"><SUP>cccxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as when a daughter-in-law sees her father-in-law, she arouses a
sense of urgency [to please him], so too, when that bhikkhu thus
recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, if equanimity
supported by the wholesome does not become established in him, then
he arouses a sense of urgency. But if, when he recollects the Buddha,
the Dhamma, and the Sangha, equanimity supported by the wholesome
becomes established in him, [187] then he is satisfied with it. At
that point, friends, much has been done by that bhikkhu.</P>
<H3 >(THE WATER ELEMENT)</H3>
<P  >11.
“What, friends, is the water element? The water element may be
either internal or external. What is the internal water element?
Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and
clung-to; that is, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears,
grease, spittle, snot, oil-of-the-joints, urine, or whatever else
internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and clungto: this
is called the internal water element. Now both the internal water
element and the external water element are simply water element. And
that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This
is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ When one sees it
thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted
with the water element and makes the mind dispassionate toward the
water element.</P>
<P  >12.
“Now there comes a time when the external water element is
disturbed. It carries away villages, towns, cities, districts, and
countries. There comes a time when the waters in the great ocean sink
down a hundred leagues, two hundred leagues, three hundred leagues,
four hundred leagues, five hundred leagues, six hundred leagues,
seven hundred leagues. There comes a time when the waters in the
great ocean stand seven palms deep, six palms deep … two palms
deep, only a palm deep. There comes a time when the waters in the
great ocean stand seven fathoms deep, six fathoms deep … two
fathoms deep, only a fathom deep. There comes a time when the waters
in the great ocean stand half a fathom deep, only waist deep, only
knee deep, only ankle deep. There comes a time when the waters in the
great ocean are not enough to wet even the joint of a finger. When
even this external water element, great as it is, [188] is seen to be
impermanent, subject to destruction, disappearance, and change, what
of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while?
There can be no considering that as ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I
am.’</P>
<P  >13-15.
“So then, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass a bhikkhu [who
has seen this element as it actually is], he understands thus: …
(repeat §§8-10) … At that point too, friends, much has been done
by that bhikkhu.</P>
<H3 >(THE FIRE ELEMENT)</H3>
<P  >16.
“What, friends, is the fire element? The fire element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal fire element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to; that
is, that by which one is warmed, ages, and is consumed, and that by
which what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets completely
digested, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is fire,
fiery, and clung-to: this is called the internal fire element. Now
both the internal fire element and the external fire element are
simply fire element. And that should be seen as it actually is with
proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not
my self.’ When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the fire element and makes the
mind dispassionate toward the fire element.</P>
<P  >17.
“Now there comes a time when the external fire element is
disturbed. It burns up villages, towns, cities, districts, and
countries. It goes out due to lack of fuel only when it comes to
green grass, or to a road, or to a rock, or to water, or to a fair
open space. There comes a time when they seek to make a fire even
with cocks’ feathers and hide-parings. When even this external fire
element, great as it is, is seen to be impermanent, subject to
destruction, disappearance, and change, what of this body, which is
clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no
considering that as ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am.’</P>
<P  >18-20.
“So then, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass a bhikkhu [who
has seen this element as it actually is], he understands thus: …

<H3 >(THE AIR ELEMENT)</H3>
<P  >21.
“What, friends, is the air element? The air element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal air element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clung-to; that
is, up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the belly, winds in
the bowels, winds that course through the limbs, in-breath and
out-breath, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is
air, airy, and clung-to: this is called the internal air element. Now
both the internal air element and the external air element are simply
air element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper
wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my
self.’ When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom,
one becomes disenchanted with the air element and makes the mind
dispassionate toward the air element. [189]</P>
<P  >22.
“Now there comes a time when the external air element is disturbed.
It sweeps away villages, towns, cities, districts, and countries.
There comes a time in the last month of the hot season when they seek
wind by means of a fan or bellows and even the strands of straw in
the drip-fringe of the thatch do not stir. When even this external

1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha on the mountain Vulture Peak; it was soon after Devadatta
had left.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote346anc" HREF="#sdendnote346sym"><SUP>cccxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
There, referring to Devadatta, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, here some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home
life into homelessness, considering: ‘I am a victim of birth,
ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair;
I am a victim of suffering, a prey to suffering. Surely an ending of
this whole mass of suffering can be known.’ When he has gone forth
thus, he acquires gain, honour, and renown. He is pleased with that
gain, honour, and renown, and his intention is fulfilled. On account
of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus: ‘I have gain,
honour, and renown, but these other bhikkhus are unknown, of no
account.’ He becomes intoxicated with that gain, honour, and
renown, grows negligent, falls into negligence, and being negligent,
he lives in suffering.</P>
<P  >“Suppose
a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood.
Passing over its heartwood, its sapwood, its inner bark, and its
outer bark, he would cut off its twigs and leaves and take them away
thinking they were heartwood. Then a man with good sight, seeing him,
might say: ‘This good man did not know the heartwood, the sapwood,
the inner bark, the outer bark, or the twigs and leaves. Thus, while
needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, he came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood,
and passing over its heartwood, its sapwood, its inner bark, and its
outer bark, he cut off its twigs and leaves and took them away
thinking they were heartwood. Whatever it was this good man had to
make with heartwood, his purpose will not be served.’ So too,
bhikkhus, here some clansman goes forth out of faith … [193] … he
lives in suffering. This bhikkhu is called one who has taken the
twigs and leaves of the holy life and stopped short with that.</P>

does not, on account of it, laud himself and disparage others. He

greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >“Master
Gotama, there are these recluses and brahmins, each the head of an
order, the head of a group, the teacher of a group, a well-known and
famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint - that is,

Kaccayana, Sanjaya Belatthiputta, and the Nigantha Nataputta.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote350anc" HREF="#sdendnote350sym"><SUP>cccl</SUP></A></SUP>

<P  >18.
“Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware
that ‘consciousness is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the base of infinite consciousness. This too is a state
higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >19.
“Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the base of nothingness. This too is a state
higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >20.
“Again, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of
neitherperception-nor-non-perception. This too is a state higher and
more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >21.
“Again, by completely surmounting the base of
neitherperception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the cessation of perception and feeling. And his taints are
destroyed by seeing with wisdom. This too is a state higher and more
sublime than knowledge and vision. These are the states that are
higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >22.
“1 say that this person, brahmin, is like a man needing heartwood,
seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, who came to a
great tree standing possessed of heartwood, and cutting off its
heartwood, took it away knowing it was heartwood; and so whatever it
was he had to make with heartwood, his purpose will have been served.</P>
<P  >23.
“So this holy life, brahmin, does not have gain, honour, and renown
for its benefit, or the attainment of virtue for its benefit, or the
attainment of concentration for its benefit, or knowledge and vision
for its benefit. But it is [205] this unshakeable deliverance of mind
that is the goal of this holy life, its heartwood, and its end.”</P>
<P  >24.
When this was said, the brahmin Pingalakoccha said to the Blessed
One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he
were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was
hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in
the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama
for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From
today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to
him for refuge for life.”</P>

31. Culagosinga Sutta - The Shorter Discourse in Gosinga</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Nadika in the Brick House.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya,
and the venerable Kimbila were living at the Park of the Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote354anc" HREF="#sdendnote354sym"><SUP>cccliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and
went to the Park of the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood. The park keeper saw
the Blessed One coming in the distance and told him: “Do not enter
this park, recluse. There are three clansmen here seeking their own
good. Do not disturb them.”</P>
<P  >4.
The venerable Anuruddha heard the park keeper speaking to the Blessed
One and told him: “Friend park keeper, do not keep the Blessed One
out. It is our Teacher, the Blessed One, who has come.” Then the
venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Nandiya and the venerable
Kimbila and said: “Come out, venerable sirs, come out! Our Teacher,
[206] the Blessed One, has come.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then all three went to meet the Blessed One. One took his bowl and
outer robe, one prepared a seat, and one set out water for washing
the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready and washed
his feet. Then those three venerable ones paid homage to the Blessed
One and sat down at one side. When they were seated, the Blessed One
said to them: “I hope you are all keeping well, Anuruddha, I hope
you are all comfortable, I hope you are not having any trouble
getting almsfood.”</P>
<P  >“We
are keeping well, Blessed One, we are comfortable, and we are not
having any trouble getting almsfood.”</P>
<P  >6.
“1 hope, Anuruddha, that you are all living in concord, with mutual
appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water,
viewing each other with kindly eyes.”</P>
<P  >“Surely,
venerable sir, we are living in concord, with mutual appreciation,
without disputing, blending like milk and water, viewing each other
with kindly eyes.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Anuruddha, how do you live thus?”</P>
<P  >7.
“Venerable sir, as to that, I think thus: ‘It is a gain for me,
it is a great gain for me, that I am living with such companions in
the holy life.’ I maintain bodily acts of loving-kindness towards
those venerable ones both openly and privately; I maintain verbal
acts of loving-kindness towards them both openly and privately; I
maintain mental acts of loving-kindness towards them both openly and
privately.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote355anc" HREF="#sdendnote355sym"><SUP>ccclv</SUP></A></SUP>
I consider: ‘Why should I not [207] set aside what I wish to do and
do what these venerable ones wish to do?’ Then I set aside what I
wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do. We are
different in body, venerable sir, but one in mind.”</P>
<P  >The
venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila each spoke likewise,
adding: “That is how, venerable sir, we are living in concord, with
mutual appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water,
viewing each other with kindly eyes.”</P>
<P  >8.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. I hope that you all abide diligent, ardent,
and resolute.”</P>
<P  >“Surely,
venerable sir, we abide diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Anuruddha, how do you abide thus?”</P>
<P  >9.
“Venerable sir, as to that, whichever of us returns first from the
village with almsfood prepares the seats, sets out the water for
drinking and for washing, and puts the refuse bucket in its place.
Whichever of us returns last eats any food left over, if he wishes;
otherwise he throws it away where there is no greenery or drops it
into water where there is no life. He puts away the seats and the
water for drinking and for washing. He puts away the refuse bucket
after washing it and he sweeps out the refectory. Whoever notices
that the pots of water for drinking, washing, or the latrine are low
or empty takes care of them. If they are too heavy for him, he calls
someone else by a signal of the hand and they move it by joining
hands, but because of this we do not break out into speech. But every
five days we sit together all night discussing the Dhamma. That is
how we abide diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</P>
<P  >10.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. But while you abide thus diligent, ardent,
and resolute, have you attained any superhuman state, a distinction
in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable
abiding?”</P>
<P  >“Why
not, venerable sir? Here, venerable sir, whenever we want, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, we
enter upon and abide in the first jhana, which is accompanied by
applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion. Venerable sir, this is a superhuman state, a distinction
in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable
abiding, which we have attained while abiding diligent, ardent, and
resolute.”</P>
<P  >11-13.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. But is there any other superhuman state, a
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a
comfortable abiding, which you have attained by surmounting that
abiding, [208] by making that abiding subside?”</P>
<P  >“Why
not, venerable sir? Here, venerable sir, whenever we want, with the
stilling of applied and sustained thought, we enter upon and abide in
the second jhana … With the fading away as well of rapture … we
enter upon and abide in the third jhana … With the abandoning of
pleasure and pain … we enter upon and abide in the fourth jhana …
Venerable sir, this is another superhuman state, a distinction in
knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable abiding,
which we have attained by surmounting the preceding abiding, by
making that abiding subside.”</P>
<P  >14.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. But is there any other superhuman state …
which you have attained by surmounting that abiding, by making that
abiding subside?”</P>
<P  >“Why
not, venerable sir? Here, venerable sir, whenever we want, with the
complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance
of perceptions of sensory impact, with non-attention to perceptions
of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite,’ [209] we enter upon
and abide in the base of infinite space. Venerable sir, this is
another superhuman state … which we have attained by surmounting
the preceding abiding, by making that abiding subside.”</P>
<P  >15-17.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. But is there any other superhuman state …
which you have attained by surmounting that abiding, by making that
abiding subside?”</P>
<P  >“Why
not, venerable sir? Here, venerable sir, whenever we want, by
completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware that
‘consciousness is infinite,’ we enter upon and abide in the base
of infinite consciousness … By completely surmounting the base of
infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ we enter
upon and abide in the base of nothingness … By completely
surmounting the base of nothingness, we enter upon and abide in the
base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Venerable sir, this is
another superhuman state … which we have attained by surmounting
the preceding abiding, by making that abiding subside.”</P>
<P  >18.
“Good, good Anuruddha. But is there any other superhuman state, a
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a
comfortable abiding, which you have attained by surmounting that
abiding, by making that abiding subside?”</P>
<P  >“Why
not, venerable sir? Here, venerable sir, whenever we want, by
completely surmounting the base of
neither-perceptionnor-non-perception, we enter upon and abide in the
cessation of perception and feeling. And our taints are destroyed by
our seeing with wisdom. Venerable sir, this is another superhuman
state, a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble
ones, a comfortable abiding, which we have attained by surmounting
the preceding abiding, by making that abiding subside. And, venerable
sir, we do not see any other comfortable abiding higher or more
sublime than this one.”</P>
<P  >“Good,
good Anuruddha. There is no other comfortable abiding higher or more
sublime than that one.”</P>
<P  >19.
Then, when the Blessed One had instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, and the
venerable Kimbila with a talk on the Dhamma, he rose from his seat
and departed.</P>
<P  >20.
After they had accompanied the Blessed One a little way and turned
back again, the venerable [210] Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila
asked the venerable Anuruddha: “Have we ever reported to the
venerable Anuruddha that we have obtained those abidings and
attainments that the venerable Anuruddha, in the Blessed One’s
presence, ascribed to us up to the destruction of the taints?”</P>
<P  >“The
venerable ones have never reported to me that they have obtained
those abidings and attainments. Yet by encompassing the venerable
ones’ minds with my own mind, I know that they have obtained those
abidings and attainments. And deities have also reported to me:
‘These venerable ones have obtained those abidings and
attainments.’ Then I declared it when directly questioned by the
Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >21.
Then the spirit Digha Parajana<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote356anc" HREF="#sdendnote356sym"><SUP>ccclvi</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, he
stood at one side and said: “It is a gain for the Vajjians,
venerable sir, a great gain for the Vajjian people that the
Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened, dwells among them and
these three clansmen, the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya,
and the venerable Kimbila!” On hearing the exclamation of the
spirit Digha Parajana, the earth gods exclaimed: “It is a gain for
the Vajjians, a great gain for the Vajjian people that the Tathagata,
accomplished and fully enlightened, dwells among them and these three
clansmen, the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, and the
venerable Kimbila!” On hearing the exclamation of the earth gods,
the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings … the gods of the
heaven of the Thirty-three … the Yama gods … the gods of the
Tusita heaven … the gods who delight in creating … the gods who
wield power over others’ creations … the gods of Brahma’s
retinue exclaimed: “It is a gain for the Vajjians, a great gain for
the Vajjian people that the Tathagata, accomplished and fully
enlightened, dwells among them and these three clansmen, the
venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, and the venerable
Kimbila!” Thus at that instant, at that moment, those venerable
ones were known as far as the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >22.
[The Blessed One said:] “So it is, Digha, so it is! And if the clan
from which those three clansmen went forth from the home life into
homelessness should remember them with confident heart, that would
lead to the welfare and happiness of that clan for a long time. And
if the retinue of the clan from which those three clansmen went forth
[211] … the village from which they went forth … the town from
which they went forth … the city from which they went forth … the
country from which those three clansmen went forth from the home life
into homelessness should remember them with confident heart, that
would lead to the welfare and happiness of that country for a long
time. If all nobles should remember those three clansmen with
confident heart, that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the
nobles for a long time. If all brahmins … all merchants … all
workers should remember those three clansmen with confident heart,
that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the workers for a
long time. If the world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas,
this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its
people, should remember those three clansmen with confident heart,
that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long
time. See, Digha, how those three clansmen are practising for the
welfare and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world,
for the good, welfare and happiness of gods and humans.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The spirit Digha Parajana was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading33"  >
32. Mahagosinga Sutta - The Greater Discourse in Gosinga</H2>
<P  >[212]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Park of the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood together with a number of very
well-known elder disciples - the venerable Sariputta, the venerable
Maha Moggallana, the venerable Maha Kassapa, the venerable Anuruddha,
the venerable Revata, the venerable Ananda, and other very well-known
elder disciples.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Maha Moggallana rose from
meditation, went to the venerable Maha Kassapa, and said to him:
“Friend Kassapa, let us go to the venerable Sariputta to listen to
the Dhamma.” - “Yes, friend,” the venerable Maha Kassapa
replied. Then the venerable Maha Moggallana, the venerable Maha
Kassapa, and the venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Sariputta
to listen to the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >3.
The venerable Ananda saw them going to the venerable Sariputta to
listen to the Dhamma. Thereupon he went to the venerable Revata and
said to him: “Friend Revata, those true men are going to the
venerable Sariputta to listen to the Dhamma. Let us also go to the
venerable Sariputta to listen to the Dhamma.” - “Yes, friend,”
the venerable Revata replied. Then the venerable Revata and the
venerable Ananda went to the venerable Sariputta to listen to the
Dhamma.</P>
<P  >4.
The venerable Sariputta saw the venerable Revata and the venerable
Ananda coming in the distance and said to the venerable Ananda: “Let
the venerable Ananda come, welcome to the venerable Ananda, the
Blessed One’s attendant, who is always in the Blessed One’s
presence. Friend Ananda, the Gosinga Salatree Wood is delightful, the
night is moonlit, the sala trees are all in blossom, and heavenly
scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend
Ananda, could illuminate the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
friend [213] Sariputta, a bhikkhu has learned much, remembers what he
has learned, and consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as
are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
with the right meaning and phrasing, and which affirm a holy life
that is utterly perfect and pure - such teachings as these he has
learned much of, remembered, mastered verbally, investigated with the
mind, and penetrated well by view. And he teaches the Dhamma to the
four assemblies with well-rounded and coherent statements and phrases
for the eradication of the underlying tendencies.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote357anc" HREF="#sdendnote357sym"><SUP>ccclvii</SUP></A></SUP>
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.”</P>
<P  >5.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta addressed the venerable
Revata thus: “Friend Revata, the venerable Ananda has spoken
according to his own inspiration.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote358anc" HREF="#sdendnote358sym"><SUP>ccclviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Now we ask the venerable Revata: Friend Revata, the Gosinga Sala-tree
Wood is delightful, the night is moonlit, the sala trees are all in
blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What
kind of bhikkhu, friend Revata, could illuminate this Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
friend Sariputta, a bhikkhu delights in solitary meditation and takes
delight in solitary meditation; he is devoted to internal serenity of
mind, does not neglect meditation, possesses insight, and dwells in
empty huts.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote359anc" HREF="#sdendnote359sym"><SUP>ccclix</SUP></A></SUP>
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.”</P>
<P  >6.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta addressed the venerable
Anuruddha thus: “Friend Anuruddha, the venerable Revata has spoken
according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Anuruddha:
Friend Anuruddha, the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood is delightful … What
kind of bhikkhu, friend Anuruddha, could illuminate this Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
friend Sariputta, with the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, a bhikkhu surveys a thousand worlds. Just as a
man with good sight, when he has ascended to the upper palace
chamber, might survey a thousand wheel-rims, so too, with the divine
eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, a bhikkhu surveys a
thousand worlds.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote360anc" HREF="#sdendnote360sym"><SUP>ccclx</SUP></A></SUP>
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.”</P>
<P  >7.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta addressed the venerable
Maha Kassapa thus: “Friend Kassapa, the venerable Anuruddha has
spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable
Maha Kassapa: Friend Kassapa, the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood is
delightful … What kind of bhikkhu, friend Kassapa, [214] could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
friend Sariputta, a bhikkhu is a forest dweller himself and speaks in
praise of forest dwelling; he is an almsfood eater himself and speaks
in praise of eating almsfood; he is a refuserag wearer himself and
speaks in praise of wearing refuse-rag robes; he is a triple-robe
wearer himself and speaks in praise of wearing the triple robe;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote361anc" HREF="#sdendnote361sym"><SUP>ccclxi</SUP></A></SUP>
he has few wishes himself and speaks in praise of fewness of wishes;
he is content himself and speaks in praise of contentment; he is
secluded himself and speaks in praise of seclusion; he is aloof from
society himself and speaks in praise of aloofness from society; he is
energetic himself and speaks in praise of arousing energy; he has
attained to virtue himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of
virtue; he has attained to concentration himself and speaks in praise
of the attainment of concentration; he has attained to wisdom himself
and speaks in praise of the attainment of wisdom; he has attained to
deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of
deliverance; he has attained to the knowledge and vision of
deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of the
knowledge and vision of deliverance. That kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.”</P>
<P  >8.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta addressed the venerable
Maha Moggallana thus: “Friend Moggallana, the venerable Maha
Kassapa has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the
venerable Maha Moggallana: Friend Moggallana, the Gosinga Sala-tree
Wood is delightful … What kind of bhikkhu, friend Moggallana, could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
friend Sariputta, two bhikkhus engage in a talk on the higher Dhamma<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote362anc" HREF="#sdendnote362sym"><SUP>ccclxii</SUP></A></SUP>
and they question each other, and each being questioned by the other
answers without foundering, and their talk rolls on in accordance
with the Dhamma. That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood.”</P>
<P  >9.
When this was said, the venerable Maha Moggallana addressed the
venerable Sariputta thus: “Friend Sariputta, we have all spoken
according to our own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Sariputta:
Friend Sariputta, the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood is delightful, the night
is moonlit, the sala trees are all in blossom, and heavenly scents
seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend
Sariputta, could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
friend Moggallana, a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind, he does
not let the mind wield mastery over him. In the morning he abides in
whatever abiding or attainment he wants [215] to abide in during the
morning; at mid-day he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he
wants to abide in at mid-day; in the evening he abides in whatever
abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the evening.
Suppose a king or a king’s minister had a chest full of variously
coloured garments. In the morning he could put on whatever pair of
garments he wanted to put on in the morning; at mid-day he could put
on whatever pair of garments he wanted to put on at mid-day; in the
evening he could put on whatever pair of garments he wanted to put on
in the evening. So too, a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind, he
does not let the mind wield mastery over him. In the morning … at
mid-day … in the evening he abides in whatever abiding or
attainment he wants to abide in during the evening. That kind of
bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.”</P>
<P  >10.
Then the venerable Sariputta addressed those venerable ones thus:
“Friends, we have all spoken according to our own inspiration. Let
us go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him. As the
Blessed One answers, so let us remember it.” - “Yes, friend,”
they replied. Then those venerable ones went to the Blessed One, and
after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side. The venerable
Sariputta said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >11.
“Venerable sir, the venerable Revata and the venerable Ananda came
to me to listen to the Dhamma. I saw them coming in the distance and
[216] said to the venerable Ananda: ‘Let the venerable Ananda come,
welcome to the venerable Ananda … Friend Ananda, the Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood is delightful … What kind of bhikkhu, friend Ananda,
could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?’ When asked,
venerable sir, the venerable Ananda replied: ‘Here, friend
Sariputta, a bhikkhu has learned much … (as in §4) … That kind
of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.’“</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Sariputta. Ananda, speaking rightly, should speak just as he
did. For Ananda has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and
consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as are good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right
meaning and phrasing, and which affirm a holy life that is utterly
perfect and pure - such teachings as these he has learned much of,
remembered, mastered verbally, investigated with the mind, and
penetrated well by view. And he teaches the Dhamma to the four
assemblies with well-rounded and coherent statements and phrases for
the eradication of the underlying tendencies.”</P>
<P  >12.
“When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable
Revata thus: ‘Friend Revata … What kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?’ And the venerable Revata
replied: ‘Here, friend Sariputta, a bhikkhu delights in solitary
meditation … (as in §5) … That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate
this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.’“</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Sariputta. Revata, speaking rightly, should speak just as he
did. For Revata delights in solitary meditation, takes delight in
solitary meditation, is devoted to internal serenity of mind, does
not neglect meditation, possesses insight, and dwells in empty huts.”
[217]</P>
<P  >13.
“When that was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable
Anuruddha thus: ‘Friend Anuruddha … What kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?’ And the venerable
Anuruddha replied: ‘Here, friend Sariputta, with the divine eye …
(as in §6) … That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood.’”</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Sariputta. Anuruddha, speaking rightly, should speak just as he
did. For with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the
human, Anuruddha surveys a thousand worlds.”</P>
<P  >14.
“When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Maha
Kassapa thus: ‘Friend Kassapa … What kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?’ And the venerable Maha
Kassapa replied: ‘Here, friend Sariputta, a bhikkhu is a
forest-dweller himself … (as in §7) … That kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.’“[218]</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Sariputta. Kassapa, speaking rightly, should speak just as he
did. For Kassapa is a forest-dweller himself and speaks in praise of
forest dwelling … he has attained to the knowledge and vision of
deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of the
knowledge and vision of deliverance.”</P>
<P  >15.
“When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Maha
Moggallana thus: ‘Friend Moggallana … What kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?’ And the venerable Maha
Moggallana replied: ‘Here, friend Sariputta, two bhikkhus engage in
a talk on the higher Dhamma … (as in §8) … That kind of bhikkhu
could illuminate this Gosinga Salatree Wood.’“</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Sariputta. Moggallana, speaking rightly, should speak just as
he did. For Moggallana is one who talks on the Dhamma.”</P>
<P  >16.
When that was said, the venerable Maha Moggallana told the Blessed
One: “Then, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Sariputta
thus: ‘Friend Sariputta … What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate
this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?’ And the venerable Sariputta replied:
‘Here, friend Moggallana, a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind …
[219] (as in §9) … That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this
Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.’“</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Moggallana. Sariputta, speaking rightly, should speak just as
he did. For Sariputta wields mastery over his mind, he does not let
the mind wield mastery over him. In the morning he abides in whatever
abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the morning; at
mid-day he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide
in at mid-day; in the evening he abides in whatever abiding or
attainment he wants to abide in during the evening.”</P>
<P  >17.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta asked the Blessed One:
“Venerable sir, which of us has spoken well?”</P>
<P  >“You
have all spoken well, Sariputta, each in his own way. Hear also from
me what kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.
Here, Sariputta, when a bhikkhu has returned from his almsround,
after his meal, he sits down, folds his legs crosswise, sets his body
erect, and establishing mindfulness in front of him, resolves: ‘I
shall not break this sitting position until through not clinging my
mind is liberated from the taints.’ That kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala tree Wood.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote363anc" HREF="#sdendnote363sym"><SUP>ccclxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. Those venerable ones were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

33. Mahagopalaka Sutta - The Greater Discourse on the Cowherd</H2>
<P  >[220]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, when a cowherd possesses eleven factors, he is incapable
of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle. What eleven? Here a cowherd
has no knowledge of form, he is unskilled in characteristics, he
fails to pick out flies’ eggs, he fails to dress wounds, he fails
to smoke out the sheds, he does not know the watering place, he does
not know what it is to have drunk, he does not know the road, he is
unskilled in pastures, he milks dry, and he shows no extra veneration
to those bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. When a
cowherd possesses these eleven factors, he is incapable of keeping
and rearing a herd of cattle.</P>
<P  >3.
“So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses eleven qualities, he is
incapable of growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and
Discipline. What eleven? Here a bhikkhu has no knowledge of form, he
is unskilled in characteristics, he fails to pick out flies’ eggs,
he fails to dress wounds, he fails to smoke out the sheds, he does
not know the watering place, he does not know what it is to have
drunk, he does not know the road, he is unskilled in pastures, he
milks dry, and he shows no extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus
of long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of
the Sangha.</P>
<P  >4.
“How has a bhikkhu no knowledge of form? Here a bhikkhu does not
understand as it actually is thus: ‘All material form of whatever
kind consists of the four great elements and the material form
derived from the four great elements.’ That is how a bhikkhu has no
knowledge of form.</P>
<P  >5.
“How is a bhikkhu unskilled in characteristics? Here a bhikkhu does
not understand as it actually is thus: ‘A fool is characterised by
his actions; a wise man is characterised by his actions.’ That is
how a bhikkhu is unskilled in characteristics.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote364anc" HREF="#sdendnote364sym"><SUP>ccclxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“How does a bhikkhu fail to pick out flies’ eggs? Here, when a
thought of sensual desire has arisen, a bhikkhu tolerates it; he does
not abandon it, remove it, do away with it, and annihilate it. When a
thought of ill will has arisen … When a thought of cruelty has
arisen … When evil unwholesome states have arisen, a bhikkhu
tolerates them; [221] he does not abandon them, remove them, do away
with them, and annihilate them. That is how a bhikkhu fails to pick
out flies’ eggs.</P>
<P  >7.
“How does a bhikkhu fail to dress wounds? Here, on seeing a form
with the eye, a bhikkhu grasps at its signs and features. Even
though, when he leaves the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome
states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he does not
practise the way of its restraint, he does not guard the eye faculty,
he does not undertake the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a
sound with the ear … On smelling an odour with the nose … On
tasting a flavour with the tongue … On touching a tangible with the
body … On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, he grasps at its
signs and features. Even though, when he leaves the mind faculty
unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might
invade him, he does not practise the way of its restraint, he does
not guard the mind faculty, he does not undertake the restraint of
the mind faculty. That is how a bhikkhu fails to dress wounds.</P>
<P  >8.
“How does a bhikkhu fail to smoke out the sheds? Here a bhikkhu
does not teach others in detail the Dhamma as he has learned it and
mastered it. That is how a bhikkhu fails to smoke out the sheds.</P>
<P  >9.
“How does a bhikkhu not know the watering place? Here a bhikkhu
does not go from time to time to those bhikkhus who have learned
much, who are well versed in the tradition, who maintain the Dhamma,
the Discipline, and the Codes,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote365anc" HREF="#sdendnote365sym"><SUP>ccclxv</SUP></A></SUP>
and he does not enquire and ask questions of them thus: ‘How is
this, venerable sir? What is the meaning of this?’ These venerable
ones do not reveal to him what has not been revealed, do not clarify
what is not clear, or remove his doubts about the numerous things
that give rise to doubt. That is how a bhikkhu does not know the
watering place.</P>
<P  >10.
“How does a bhikkhu not know what it is to have drunk? Here, when
the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata is being
taught, a bhikkhu does not gain inspiration in the meaning, does not
gain inspiration in the Dhamma, does not gain gladness connected with
the Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote366anc" HREF="#sdendnote366sym"><SUP>ccclxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how a bhikkhu does not know what it is to have drunk.</P>
<P  >11.
“How does a bhikkhu not know the road? Here a bhikkhu does not
understand the Noble Eightfold Path as it actually is. That is how a
bhikkhu does not know the road.</P>
<P  >12.
“How is a bhikkhu unskilled in pastures? Here a bhikkhu does not
understand the four foundations of mindfulness as they actually are.
That is how [222] a bhikkhu is unskilled in pastures.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote367anc" HREF="#sdendnote367sym"><SUP>ccclxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
“How does a bhikkhu milk dry? Here, when faithful householders
invite a bhikkhu to take as much as he likes of robes, almsfood,
resting places, and medicinal requisites, the bhikkhu does not know
moderation in accepting. That is how a bhikkhu milks dry.</P>
<P  >14.
“How does a bhikkhu show no extra veneration to those elder
bhikkhus of long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and
leaders of the Sangha? Here a bhikkhu does not maintain bodily acts
of loving-kindness both openly and privately towards those elder
bhikkhus; he does not maintain verbal acts of loving-kindness towards
them both openly and privately; he does not maintain mental acts of
loving-kindness towards them both openly and privately. That is how a
bhikkhu shows no extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus of
long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of
the Sangha.</P>
<P  >“When
a bhikkhu possesses these eleven qualities, he is incapable of
growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline.</P>
<P  >15.
“Bhikkhus, when a cowherd possesses eleven factors, he is capable
of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle. What eleven? Here a cowherd
has knowledge of form, he is skilled in characteristics, he picks out
flies’ eggs, he dresses wounds, he smokes out the sheds, he knows
the watering place, he knows what it is to have drunk, he knows the
road, he is skilled in pastures, he does not milk dry, and he shows
extra veneration to those bulls who are fathers and leaders of the
herd. When a cowherd possesses these eleven factors, he is capable of
keeping and rearing a herd of cattle.</P>
<P  >16.
“So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses these eleven qualities,
he is capable of growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamrna and
Discipline. What eleven? Here a bhikkhu has knowledge of form, he is
skilled in characteristics, he picks out flies’ eggs, he dresses
wounds, he smokes out the sheds, he knows the watering place, he
knows what it is to have drunk, he knows the road, he is skilled in
pastures, he does not milk dry, and he shows extra veneration to
those elder bhikkhus of longstanding who have long since gone forth,
the fathers and leaders of the Sangha.</P>
<P  >17.
“How does a bhikkhu have knowledge of form? Here a bhikkhu
understands as it actually is thus: ‘All material form of whatever
kind consists of the four [223] great elements and the material form
derived from the four great elements.’ That is how a bhikkhu has
knowledge of form.</P>
<P  >18.
“How is a bhikkhu skilled in characteristics? Here a bhikkhu
understands as it actually is thus: ‘A fool is characterised by his
actions; a wise man is characterised by his actions.’ That is how a
bhikkhu is skilled in characteristics.</P>
<P  >19.
“How does a bhikkhu pick out flies’ eggs? Here, when a thought of
sensual desire has arisen, a bhikkhu does not tolerate it; he
abandons it, removes it, does away with it, and annihilates it. When
a thought of ill will has arisen … When a thought of cruelty has
arisen … When evil unwholesome states have arisen, a bhikkhu does
not tolerate them; he abandons them, removes them, does away with
them, and annihilates them. That is how a bhikkhu picks out flies’
eggs.</P>
<P  >20.
“How does a bhikkhu dress wounds? Here, on seeing a form with the
eye, a bhikkhu does not grasp at its signs and features. Since if he
left the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of
covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its
restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of
the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear … On smelling an
odour with the nose … On tasting a flavour with the tongue … On
touching a tangible with the body … On cognizing a mind-object with
the mind, a bhikkhu does not grasp at its signs and features. Since,
if he left the mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of
covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its
restraint, he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of
the mind faculty. That is how a bhikkhu dresses wounds.</P>
<P  >21.
“How does a bhikkhu smoke out the sheds? Here a bhikkhu teaches
others in detail the Dhamma as he has learned it and mastered it.
That is how a bhikkhu smokes out the sheds.</P>
<P  >22.
“How does a bhikkhu know the watering place? Here a bhikkhu goes
from time to time to such bhikkhus who have learned much, who are
well versed in the tradition, who maintain the Dhamma, the
Discipline, and the Codes, and he enquires and asks questions of them
thus: ‘How is this, venerable sir? What is the meaning of this?’
These venerable ones reveal to him what has not been revealed,
clarify what is not clear, and remove his doubts about the numerous
things that give rise to doubt. That is how a bhikkhu knows the
watering place.</P>
<P  >23.
“How does [224] a bhikkhu know what it is to have drunk? Here, when
the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata is being
taught, a bhikkhu gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration
in the Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. That is how
a bhikkhu knows what it is to have drunk.</P>
<P  >24.
“How does a bhikkhu know the road? Here a bhikkhu understands the
Noble Eightfold Path as it actually is. That is how a bhikkhu
understands the road.</P>
<P  >25.
“How is a bhikkhu skilled in pastures? Here a bhikkhu understands
the four foundations of mindfulness as they actually are. That is how
a bhikkhu is skilled in pastures.</P>
<P  >26.
“How does a bhikkhu not milk dry? Here, when faithful householders
invite a bhikkhu to take as much as he likes of robes, almsfood,
resting places, and medicinal requisites, the bhikkhu knows
moderation in accepting. That is how a bhikkhu does not milk dry.</P>
<P  >27.
“How does a bhikkhu show extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus

both openly and privately towards those elder bhikkhus; he maintains

34. Culagopalaka Sutta - The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd</H2>
<P  >[225]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Vajjian country at Ukkacela on the banks of the river Ganges.
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable
sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, there was once a foolish Magadhan cowherd who, in the
last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, without examining the
near shore or the further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle
across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had
no ford. Then the cattle bunched together in mid-stream in the river
Ganges, and they met with calamity and disaster. Why was that?
Because that foolish Magadhan cowherd, in the last month of the rainy
season, in the autumn, without examining the near shore or the
further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle across to the
other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had no ford.</P>
<P  >3.
“So too, bhikkhus, as to those recluses and brahmins who are
unskilled in this world and the other world, unskilled in Mara’s
realm and what is outside Mara’s realm, unskilled in the realm of
Death and what is outside the realm of Death - it will lead to the
harm and suffering for a long time of those who think they should
listen to them and place faith in them.</P>
<P  >4.
“Bhikkhus, there was once a wise Magadhan cowherd who, in the last
month of the rainy season, in the autumn, after examining the near
shore and the further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle
across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had
a ford. He made the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd, enter
first, and they breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely
across to the further shore. He made the strong cattle and the cattle
to be tamed enter next, and they</P>
<P  >too
breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the
further shore. He made the heifers and young oxen enter next, and
they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to
the further shore. He made the calves and the feeble cattle enter
next, and they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely
across to the further shore. At the time there was a tender calf just
born, and being urged on by its mother’s lowing, it too breasted
the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore.
Why was that? Because that wise Magadhan cowherd, [226] in the last
month of the rainy season, in the autumn, after examining the near
shore and the further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle
across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had
a ford.</P>
<P  >5.
“So too, bhikkhus, as to those recluses and brahmins who are
skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in Mara’s realm
and what is outside Mara’s realm, skilled in the realm of Death and
what is outside the realm of Death - it willl lead to the welfare and
happiness for a long time of those who think they should listen to
them and place faith in them.</P>
<P  >6.
“Bhikkhus, just as the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd,
breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the
further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints
destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done,
laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of
being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge - by
breasting Mara’s stream they have gotten safely across to the
further shore.</P>
<P  >7.
“Just as the strong cattle and the cattle to be tamed breasted the
stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so
too, those bhikkhus who, with the destruction of the five lower
fetters, will reappear spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there
attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world - by
breasting Mara’s stream they will get safely across to the further
shore.</P>
<P  >8.
“Just as the heifers and young oxen breasted the stream of the
Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those
bhikkhus who, with the destruction of three fetters and with the
attenuation of lust, hate, and delusion, are once-returners,
returning once to this world to make an end of suffering - by
breasting Mara’s stream they too will get safely across to the fur
ther shore.</P>
<P  >9.
“Just as the calves and the feeble cattle breasted the stream of
the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those
bhikkhus who, with the destruction of three fetters, are
stream-enterers, no longer subject to perdition, bound [for
deliverance], headed for enlightenment - by breasting Mara’s stream
they too will get safely across to the further shore.</P>
<P  >10.
“Just as that tender calf just born, being urged on by its mother’s
lowing, also breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across
to the further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who are Dhamma-followers
and faith-followers - by breasting Mara’s stream they too will get
safely across to the further shore.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote368anc" HREF="#sdendnote368sym"><SUP>ccclxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
“Bhikkhus, I am [227] skilled in this world and in the other world,
skilled in Mara’s realm and in what is outside Mara’s realm,
skilled in the realm of Death and in what is outside the realm of
Death. It will lead to the welfare and happiness for a long time of
those who think they should listen to me and place faith in me.”</P>
<P  >12.
That is what the Blessed One said. When the Sublime One had said
that, the Teacher said further:</P>
<P >
“Both this world and the world beyond</P>
<P >
Are well described by the one who knows,</P>
<P >
And what is still in Mara’s reach</P>
<P >
And what is out of reach of Death.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Knowing directly all the world,</P>
<P >
The Enlightened One who understands</P>
<P >
Opened the door to the deathless state</P>
<P >
By which Nibbana may be safely reached;</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
For Mara’s stream is breasted now,</P>
<P >
Its current blocked, its reeds removed;</P>
<P >
Rejoice then, bhikkhus, mightily</P>
<P >
And set your hearts where safety lies.”</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading36"  >
35. Culasaccaka Sutta - The Shorter Discourse to Saccaka</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was staying at
Vesali, a debater and a clever speaker regarded by many as a saint.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote369anc" HREF="#sdendnote369sym"><SUP>ccclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
He was making this statement before the Vesali assembly: “I see no
recluse or brahmin, the head of an order, the head of a group, the
teacher of a group, even one claiming to be accomplished and fully
enlightened, who would not shake, shiver, and tremble, and sweat
under the armpits if he were to engage in debate with me. Even if I
were to engage a senseless post in debate, it would shake, shiver,
and tremble if it were to engage in debate with me, so what shall I
say of a human being?”</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Assaji dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, went into Vesali for alms.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote370anc" HREF="#sdendnote370sym"><SUP>ccclxx</SUP></A></SUP>
As Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was walking and wandering for
exercise in Vesali, [228] he saw the venerable Assaji coming in the
distance and went up to him and exchanged greetings with him. When
this courteous and amiable talk was finished, Saccaka the Nigantha’s
son stood at one side and said to him:</P>
<P  >4.
“Master Assaji, how does the recluse Gotama discipline his
disciples? And how is the recluse Gotama’s instruction usually
presented to his disciples?”</P>
<P  >“This
is how the Blessed One disciplines his disciples, Aggivessana, and
this is how the Blessed One’s instruction is usually presented to
his disciples: ‘Bhikkhus, material form is impermanent, feeling is
impermanent, perception is impermanent, formations are impermanent,
consciousness is impermanent. Bhikkhus, material form is not self,
feeling is not self, perception is not self, formations are not self,
consciousness is not self. All formations are impermanent; all things
are not self.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote371anc" HREF="#sdendnote371sym"><SUP>ccclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how the Blessed One disciplines his disciples, and that is
how the Blessed One’s instruction is usually presented to his
disciples.”</P>
<P  >“If
this is what the recluse Gotama asserts, we hear indeed what is
disagreeable. Perhaps sometime or other we might meet Master Gotama
and have some conversation with him. Perhaps we might detach him from
that evil view.”</P>
<P  >5.
Now at that time five hundred Licchavis had met together in an
assembly hall for some business or other. Then Saccaka the Nigantha’s
son went to them and said: “Come forth, good Licchavis, come forth!
Today there will be some conversation between me and the recluse
Gotama. If the recluse Gotama maintains before me what was maintained
before me by one of his famous disciples, the bhikkhu named Assaji,
then just as a strong man might seize a long-haired ram by the hair
and drag him to and drag him fro and drag him round about, so in
debate I will drag the recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag
him round about. Just as a strong brewer’s workman might throw a
big brewer’s sieve into a deep water tank, and taking it by the
corners, drag it to and drag it fro and drag it round about, so in
debate I will drag the recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag
him round about. Just as a strong brewer’s mixer [229] might take a
strainer by the corners and shake it down and shake it up and thump
it about, so in debate I will shake the recluse Gotama down and shake
him up and thump him about. And just as a sixty-year-old elephant
might plunge into a deep pond and enjoy playing the game of
hemp-washing, so I shall enjoy playing the game of hemp-washing with
the recluse Gotama.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote372anc" HREF="#sdendnote372sym"><SUP>ccclxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Come forth, good Licchavis, come forth! Today there will be some
conversation between me and the recluse Gotama.”</P>
<P  >6.
Thereupon some Licchavis said: “How can the recluse Gotama refute
Saccaka the Nigantha’s son’s assertions? On the contrary, Saccaka
the Nigantha’s son will refute the recluse Gotama’s assertions.”
And some Licchavis said: “Who is Saccaka the Nigantha’s son that
he could refute the Blessed One’s assertions? On the contrary, the
Blessed One will refute Saccaka the Nigantha’s son’s assertions.”
Then Saccaka the Nigantha’s son went with five hundred Licchavis to
the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great Wood.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in
the open. Then Saccaka the Nigantha’s son went up to them and
asked: “Where is Master Gotama staying now, sirs? We want to see
Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“The
Blessed One has entered the Great Wood, Aggivessana, and is sitting
at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding.”</P>
<P  >8.
Then Saccaka the Nigantha’s son, together with a large following of
Licchavis, entered the Great Wood and went to the Blessed One. He
exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and after this courteous
and amiable talk was finished, sat down at one side. Some of the
Licchavis paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side;
some exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their
hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down
at one side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One’s
presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at
one side.</P>
<P  >9.
When Saccaka the Nigantha’s son had sat down, he said to the
Blessed One: “I would like to question Master Gotama on a certain
point, if Master Gotama would grant me the favour of an answer to the
question.”</P>
<P  >“Ask
what you like, Aggivessana.” [230]</P>
<P  >“How
does Master Gotama discipline his disciples? And how is Master
Gotama’s instruction usually presented to his disciples?”</P>
<P  >“This
is how I discipline my disciples, Aggivessana, and this is how my
instruction is usually presented to my disciples: ‘Bhikkhus,
material form is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is
impermanent, formations are impermanent, consciousness is
impermanent. Bhikkhus, material form is not self, feeling is not
self, perception is not self, formations are not self, consciousness
is not self. All formations are impermanent; all things are not
self.’ That is the way I discipline my disciples, and that is how
my instruction is usually presented to my disciples.”</P>
<P  >10.
“A simile occurs to me, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“Explain
how it occurs to you, Aggivessana,” the Blessed One said.</P>
<P  >“Just
as when seeds and plants, whatever their kind, reach growth,
increase, and maturation, all do so in dependence upon the earth,
based upon the earth; and just as when strenuous works, whatever
their kind, are done, all are done in dependence upon the earth,
based upon the earth - so too, Master</P>
<P  >Gotama,
a person has material form as self, and based upon material form he
produces merit or demerit. A person has feeling as self, and based
upon feeling he produces merit or demerit. A person has perception as
self, and based upon perception he produces merit or demerit. A
person has formations as self, and based upon formations he produces
merit or demerit. A person has consciousness as self, and based upon
consciousness he produces merit or demerit.”</P>
<P  >11.
“Aggivessana, are you not asserting thus: ‘Material form is my
self, feeling is my self, perception is my self, formations are my
self, consciousness is my self’?”</P>
<P  >“I
assert thus, Master Gotama: ‘Material form is my self, feeling is
my self, perception is my self, formations are my self, con
sciousness is my self.’ And so does this great multitude.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote373anc" HREF="#sdendnote373sym"><SUP>ccclxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“What
has this great multitude to do with you, Aggivessana? Please confine
yourself to your own assertion alone.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
Master Gotama, I assert thus: ‘Material form is my self, feeling is
my self, perception is my self, formations are my self, consciousness

“In that case, Aggivessana, I shall ask you a question in return.
Answer it as you choose. [231] What do you think, Aggivessana? Would
a head-anointed noble king - for example, King Pasenadi of Kosala or
King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha - exercise the power in his
own realm to execute those who should be executed, to fine those who
should be fined, and to banish those who should be banished?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Gotama, a head-anointed noble king - for example, King Pasenadi of
Kosala or King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha - would exercise the
power in his own realm to execute those who should be executed, to
fine those who should be fined, and to banish those who should be
banished. For even these [oligarchic] communities and societies such
as the Vajjians and the Mallians exercise the power in their own
realm to execute those who should be executed, to fine those who
should be fined, and to banish those who should be banished; so all
the more so should a head-anointed noble king such as King Pasenadi
of Kosala or King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha. He would
exercise it, Master Gotama, and he would be worthy to exercise it.”</P>
<P  >13.
“What do you think, Aggivessana? When you say thus: ‘Material

When this was said, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was silent.</P>
<P  >A
second time the Blessed One asked the same question, and a second
time Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was silent. Then the Blessed One
said to him: “Aggivessana, answer now. Now is not the time to be
silent. If anyone, when asked a reasonable question up to the third
time by the Tathagata, still does not answer, his head splits into
seven pieces there and then.”</P>
<P  >14.
Now on that occasion a thunderbolt-wielding spirit holding an iron
thunderbolt that burned, blazed, and glowed, appeared in the air
above Saccaka the Nigantha’s son, thinking: “If this Saccaka the
Nigantha’s son, when asked a reasonable question up to the third

The Blessed One saw the thunderbolt-wielding spirit and so did
Saccaka the Nigantha’s son. Then Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was
frightened, alarmed, and terrified. [232] Seeking his shelter,
asylum, and refuge in the Blessed One, he said: “Ask me, Master
Gotama, I will answer.”</P>

“It is as though a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood,
wandering in search of heartwood, were to take a sharp axe and enter
the wood, and there he would see a large plantain trunk, straight,
young, with no fruit-bud core. Then he would cut it down at the root,
cut off the crown, and unroll the leafsheaths; but as he went on
unrolling the leaf sheaths, he would never come even to any sapwood,
let alone heartwood. So too, Aggivessana, when you are pressed,
questioned, and cross questioned by me about your own assertion, you
turn out to be empty, vacant, and mistaken. But it was you who made
this statement before the Vesali assembly: ‘I see no recluse or
Brahmin, the head of an order, the head of a group, the teacher of a
group, even one claiming to be accomplished and fully enlightened,
who would not shake, shiver, and tremble and sweat under the armpits
if he were to engage in debate with me. Even if I were to engage a
senseless post in debate, it would shake, shiver, and tremble if it
were to engage in debate with me, so what shall I say of a human
being?’ Now there are drops of sweat on your forehead and they have
soaked through your upper robe and fallen to the ground. But there is
no sweat on my body now.” And the Blessed One uncovered his
goldencoloured body before the assembly. [234] When this was said,
Saccaka the Nigantha’s son sat silent, dismayed, with shoulders
drooping and head down, glum, and without response.</P>
<P  >23.
Then Dummukha, the son of the Licchavis, seeing Saccaka the
Nigantha’s son in such a condition, said to the Blessed One: “A
simile occurs to me, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“Explain
how it occurs to you, Dummukha.”</P>
<P  >“Suppose,
venerable sir, not far from a village or town there was a pond with a
crab in it. And then a party of boys and girls went out from the town
or village to the pond, went into the water, and pulled the crab out
of the water and put it on dry land. And whenever the crab extended a
leg, they cut it off, broke it, and smashed it with sticks and
stones, so that the crab with all its legs cut off, broken, and
smashed, would be unable to get back to the pond as before. So too,
all Saccaka the Nigantha’s son’s contortions, writhings, and
vacillations have been cut off, broken, and smashed by the Blessed
One, and now he cannot get near the Blessed One again for the purpose
of debate.”</P>
<P  >24.
When this was said, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son told him: “Wait,
Dummukha, wait! We are not speaking with you, here we are speaking
with Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >[Then
he said]: “Let that talk of ours be, Master Gotama. Like that of
ordinary recluses and brahmins, it was mere prattle, I think. But in
what way is a disciple of the recluse Gotama one who carries out his
instruction, who responds to his advice, who has crossed beyond
doubt, become free from perplexity, gained intrepidity, and become
independent of others in the Teacher’s Dispensation?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote377anc" HREF="#sdendnote377sym"><SUP>ccclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Here,

“Master Gotama, in what way is a bhikkhu an arahant with taints

When a bhikkhu is thus liberated, he still honours, reveres, and
venerates the Tathagata thus: ‘The Blessed One is enlightened and
he teaches the Dhamma for the sake of enlightenment. The Blessed One
is tamed and he teaches the Dhamma for taming oneself. The Blessed
One is at peace and he teaches the Dhamma for the sake of peace. The
Blessed One has crossed over and he teaches the Dhamma for crossing
over. The Blessed One has attained Nibbana and he teaches the Dhamma
for attaining Nibbana.’“</P>
<P  >27.
When this was said, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son [236] replied:
“Master Gotama, we were bold and impudent in thinking we could
attack Master Gotama in debate. A man might attack a mad elephant and
find safety, yet he could not attack Master Gotama and find safety. A
man might attack a blazing mass of fire and find safety, yet he could
not attack Master Gotama and find safety. A man might attack a
terrible poisonous snake and find safety, yet he could not attack
Master Gotama and find safety. We were bold and impudent in thinking
we could attack Master Gotama in debate.</P>
<P  >“Let
the Blessed One together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to
accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Blessed One consented in
silence.</P>
<P  >28.
Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, Saccaka the
Nigantha’s son addressed the Licchavis: “Hear me, Licchavis. The
recluse Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus has been invited
by me for tomorrow’s meal. You may bring to me whatever you think
would be suitable for him.”</P>
<P  >29.
Then, when the night had ended, the Licchavis brought five hundred
ceremonial dishes of milk rice as gifts of food. Then Saccaka the
Nigantha’s son had good food of various kinds prepared in his own
park and had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It is time,
Master Gotama, the meal is ready.”</P>
<P  >30.
Then, it being morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl
and outer robe, he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the park of
Saccaka the Nigantha’s son and sat down on the seat made ready.
Then, with his own hands, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son served and
satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the
various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One had eaten and had
withdrawn his hand from the bowl, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son took a
low seat, sat down at one side, and said to the Blessed One: “Master
Gotama, may the merit and the great meritorious fruits of this act of
giving be for the happiness of the givers.”</P>
<P  >“Aggivessana,
whatever comes about from giving to a recipient such as yourself -
one who is not free from lust, not free from hate, not free from

<P  >2.
Now on that occasion, when it was morning, the Blessed One had
finished dressing and had taken his bowl and outer robe, desiring to
go into Vesali for alms.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, as Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was walking and wandering for

Wood.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote380anc" HREF="#sdendnote380sym"><SUP>ccclxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
The venerable Ananda saw him coming in the distance and said to the

The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready. Then Saccaka the

“Master Gotama, there are some recluses and brahmins who abide
pursuing development of body, but not development of mind.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote382anc" HREF="#sdendnote382sym"><SUP>ccclxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
They are touched by bodily painful feeling. In the past, when one was
touched by bodily painful feeling, one’s thighs would become rigid,
one’s heart would burst, hot blood would gush from one’s mouth,
and one would go mad, go out of one’s mind. So then the mind was
subservient to the body, the body wielded mastery over it. Why is
that? [238] Because the mind was not developed. But there are some
recluses and brahmins who abide pursuing development of mind, but not
development of body. They are touched by mental painful feeling. In
the past, when one was touched by mental painful feeling, one’s
thighs would become rigid, one’s heart would burst, hot blood would
gush from one’s mouth, and one would go mad, go out of one’s
mind. So then the body was subservient to the mind, the mind wielded
mastery over it. Why is that? Because the body was not developed.
Master Gotama, it has occurred to me: ‘Surely Master Gotama’s
disciples abide pursuing development of mind, but not development of
body.’“</P>
<P  >5.
“But, Aggivessana, what have you learned about development of
body?”</P>
<P  >“Well,
there are, for example, Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sankicca, Makkhali
Gosala.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote383anc" HREF="#sdendnote383sym"><SUP>ccclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
They go naked, rejecting conventions, licking their hands, not coming
when asked, not stopping when asked; they do not accept food brought
or food specially made or an invitation to a meal; they receive
nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across a threshold, across a stick,
across a pestle, from two eating together, from a pregnant woman,
from a woman giving suck, from a woman lying with a man, from where
food is advertised to be distributed, from where a dog is waiting,
from where flies are buzzing; they accept no fish or meat, they drink
no liquor, wine, or fermented brew. They keep to one house, to one
morsel; they keep to two houses, to two morsels … they keep to
seven houses, to seven morsels. They live on one saucerful a day, on
two saucerfuls a day … on seven saucerfuls a day. They take food
once a day, once every two days … once every seven days, and so on
up to once every fortnight; they dwell pursuing the practice of
taking food at stated intervals.”</P>
<P  >6.
“But do they subsist on so little, Aggivessana?”</P>
<P  >“No,
Master Gotama, sometimes they consume excellent hard food, eat
excellent soft food, taste excellent delicacies, drink excellent
drinks. Thereby they again regain their strength, fortify themselves,
and become fat.”</P>
<P  >“What
they earlier abandoned, Aggivessana, they later gather together
again. That is how there is increase and decrease of this body. But
what have you learned about development of mind?” [239]</P>
<P  >When
Saccaka the Nigantha’s son was asked by the Blessed One about
development of mind, he was unable to answer.</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One told him: “What you have just spoken of as
development of body, Aggivessana, is not development of body
according to the Dhamma in the Noble One’s</P>
<P  >Discipline.
Since you do not know what development of body is, how could you know
what development of mind is? Nevertheless, Aggivessana, as to how one
is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind, listen and attend
closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes, sir,” Saccaka the
Nigantha’s son replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >8.
“How, Aggivessana, is one undeveloped in body and undeveloped in
mind? Here, Aggivessana, pleasant feeling arises in an untaught
ordinary person. Touched by that pleasant feeling, he lusts after
pleasure and continues to lust after pleasure. That pleasant feeling
of his ceases. With the cessation of the pleasant feeling, painful
feeling arises. Touched by that painful feeling, he sorrows, grieves,
and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught. When
that pleasant feeling has arisen in him, it invades his mind and
remains because body is not developed. And when that painful feeling
has arisen in him, it invades his mind and remains because mind is
not developed. Anyone in whom, in this double manner, arisen pleasant
feeling invades his mind and remains because body is not developed,
and arisen painful feeling invades his mind and remains because mind
is not developed, is thus undeveloped in body and undeveloped in
mind.</P>
<P  >9.
“And how, Aggivessana, is one developed in body and developed in
mind? Here, Aggivessana, pleasant feeling arises in a well-taught
noble disciple. Touched by that pleasant feeling, he does not lust
after pleasure or continue to lust after pleasure. That pleasant
feeling of his ceases. With the cessation of the pleasant feeling,
painful feeling arises. Touched by that painful feeling, he does not
sorrow, grieve, and lament, he does not weep beating his breast and
become distraught. When that pleasant feeling has arisen in him, it
does not invade his mind and remain because body is developed. And
when that painful feeling has arisen in him, it does not invade his
mind and remain because mind is developed. Anyone in whom, in this
double manner, arisen pleasant feeling [240] does not invade his mind
and remain because body is developed, and arisen painful feeling does

“I have confidence in Master Gotama thus: ‘Master Gotama is
developed in body and developed in mind.’“</P>
<P  >“Surely,
Aggivessana, your words are offensive and discourteous, but still I
will answer you. Since I shaved off my hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness, it
has not been possible for arisen pleasant feeling to invade my mind
and remain or for arisen painful feeling to invade my mind and
remain.”</P>
<P  >11.
“Has there never arisen in Master Gotama a feeling so pleasant that
it could invade his mind and remain? Has there never arisen in Master
Gotama a feeling so painful that it could invade his mind and

<P  >12.
“Why not, Aggivessana?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote385anc" HREF="#sdendnote385sym"><SUP>ccclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, Aggivessana, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an
unenlightened Bodhisatta, I thought: ‘Household life is crowded and
dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living in
a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished
shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe,
and go forth from the home life into homelessness.’</P>
<P  >13-16.
“Later, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with

“Now these three similes occurred to me spontaneously, never heard
before. Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood lying in water,
and a man came with an upper fire-stick, thinking: ‘I shall light a

the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper fire-stick
and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood lying in the
water?”</P>
<P  >“No,

weariness and disappointment.”</P>

“1 thought: ‘Suppose, with my teeth clenched and my tongue
pressed against the roof of my mouth, I beat down, constrain, and
crush mind with mind.’ So, with my teeth clenched and my tongue
pressed against the roof of my mouth, I beat down, constrained, and
crushed mind with mind. While I did so, sweat ran from my armpits.
Just as a strong man might seize a weaker man by the head or
shoulders and beat him down, constrain him, and crush him, so too,
with my teeth clenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my
mouth, I beat down, constrained, and crushed mind with mind, and
sweat ran from my armpits. But although tireless energy was aroused
in me and unremitting mindfulness was established, my body was

“I thought: ‘Suppose I practise the breathingless meditation.’
So I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth and
nose. While I did so, there was a loud sound of winds coming out from
my earholes. Just as there is a loud sound when a smith’s bellows
are blown, so too, while I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths
through my nose and ears, there was a loud sound of winds coming out
from my earholes. But although tireless energy was aroused in me and
unremitting mindfulness was established, my body was overwrought and
uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful striving. But such
painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >22.
“I thought: ‘Suppose I practise further the breathingless
meditation.’ So I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my
mouth, nose, and ears. While I did so, violent winds cut through my
head. Just as if a strong man were splitting my head open with a
sharp sword, so too, while I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths
through my mouth, nose, and ears, violent winds cut through my head.
But although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting
mindfulness was established, my body was overwrought and uncalm
because I was exhausted by the painful striving. But such painful
feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >23.
“I thought: ‘Suppose I practise further the breathingless
meditation.’ So I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my
mouth, nose, and ears. While I did so, there were violent pains in my
head. Just as if a strong man [244] were tightening a tough leather
strap around my head as a headband, so too, while I stopped the
in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and ears, there
were violent pains in my head. But although tireless energy was
aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established, my body
was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful
striving. But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my
mind and remain.</P>
<P  >24.
“I thought: ‘Suppose I practise further the breathingless
meditation.’ So I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my
mouth, nose, and ears. While I did so, violent winds carved up my
belly. Just as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve
up an ox’s belly with a sharp butcher’s knife, so too, while I
stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and
ears, violent winds carved up my belly. But although tireless energy
was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established, my
body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the
painful striving. But such painful feeling that arose in me did not
invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >25.
“I thought: ‘Suppose I practise further the breathingless
meditation.’ So I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my
mouth, nose, and ears. While I did so, there was a violent burning in
my body. Just as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both
arms and roast him over a pit of hot coals, so too, while I stopped
the in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and ears,
there was a violent burning in my body. But although tireless energy
was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established, my
body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the
painful striving. But such painful feeling that arose in me did not
invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >26.
“Now when [245] deities saw me, some said: ‘The recluse Gotama is
dead.’ Other deities said: ‘The recluse Gotama is not dead, he is
dying.’ And other deities said: ‘The recluse Gotama is not dead
nor dying; he is an arahant, for such is the way arahants abide.’</P>
<P  >27.
“I thought: ‘Suppose I practise entirely cutting off food.’
Then deities came to me and said: ‘Good sir, do not practise
entirely cutting off food. If you do so, we shall infuse heavenly
food into the pores of your skin and you will live on that.’ I
considered: ‘If I claim to be completely fasting while these
deities infuse heavenly food into the pores of my skin and I live on
that, then I shall be lying.’ So I dismissed those deities, saying:
‘There is no need.’</P>
<P  >28.
“I thought: ‘Suppose I take very little food, a handful each
time, whether of bean soup or lentil soup or vetch soup or pea soup.’
So I took very little food, a handful each time, whether of bean soup
or lentil soup or vetch soup or pea soup. While I did so, my body
reached a state of extreme emaciation. Because of eating so little my
limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems.
Because of eating so little my backside became like a camel’s hoof.
Because of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth
like corded beads. Because of eating so little my ribs jutted out as
gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn. Because of eating
so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets,
looking like the gleam of water that has sunk far down in a deep
well. Because of eating so little my scalp shrivelled and withered as
[246] a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sun.
Because of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone;
thus if I touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone and if I
touched my backbone I encountered my belly skin. Because of eating so
little, if I urinated or defecated, I fell over on my face there.
Because of eating so little, if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my
limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell from my body
as I rubbed.</P>
<P  >29.
“Now when people saw me, some said: ‘The recluse Gotama is
black.’ Other people said: ‘The recluse Gotama is not black, he
is brown.’ Other people said: ‘The recluse Gotama is neither
black nor brown, he is golden-skinned.’ So much had the clear,
bright colour of my skin deteriorated through eating so little.</P>
<P  >30.
“1 thought: ‘Whatever recluses or brahmins in the past have
experienced painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, this
is the utmost, there is none beyond this. And whatever recluses and
brahmins in the future will experience painful, racking, piercing
feelings due to exertion, this is the utmost, there is none beyond
this. And whatever recluses and brahmins at present experience
painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, this is the
utmost, there is none beyond this. But by this racking practice of
austerities I have not attained any superhuman states, any
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Could
there be another path to enlightenment?’</P>
<P  >31.
“1 considered: ‘I recall that when my father the Sakyan was
occupied, while I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree,
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, I entered upon and abided in the first jhana, which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote389anc" HREF="#sdendnote389sym"><SUP>ccclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Could that be the path to enlightenment?’ Then, following on that
memory, came the realisation: ‘That is the path to enlightenment.’</P>
<P  >32.
“I thought: ‘Why [247] am I afraid of that pleasure that has
nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states?’ I
thought: ‘I am not afraid of that pleasure since it has nothing to
do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote390anc" HREF="#sdendnote390sym"><SUP>cccxc</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >33.
“I considered: ‘It is not easy to attain that pleasure with a
body so excessively emaciated. Suppose I ate some solid food - some
boiled rice and bread.’ And I ate some solid food - some boiled
rice and bread. Now at that time five bhikkhus were waiting upon me,
thinking: ‘If our recluse Gotama achieves some higher state, he
will inform us.’ But when I ate the boiled rice and bread, the five
bhikkhus were disgusted and left me, thinking: ‘The recluse Gotama
now lives luxuriously; he has given up his striving and reverted to
luxury.’</P>
<P  >34.
“Now when I had eaten solid food and regained my strength, then
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, I entered upon and abided in the first jhana, which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion. But such pleasant feeling that arose in
me did not invade my mind and remain.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote391anc" HREF="#sdendnote391sym"><SUP>cccxci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >35-37.
“With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, I entered upon
and abided in the second jhana … With the fading away as well of
rapture … I entered upon and abided in the third jhana … With the
abandoning of pleasure and pain … I entered upon and abided in the
fourth jhana … But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not
invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >38.
“When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, [248] I directed it to knowledge of the
recollection of past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives,
that is, one birth, two births … (as Sutta 4, §27) … Thus with
their aspects and particulars I recollected my manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >39.
“This was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute. But such pleasant feeling that arose
in me did not invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >40.
“When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 4, §29) … Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings pass on
according to their actions.</P>
<P  >41.
“This was the second true knowledge attained by me in the second
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
[249] darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who
abides diligent, ardent, and resolute. But such pleasant feeling that
arose in me did not invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >42.
“When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’;
… ’This is the origin of suffering’; … ’This is the
cessation of suffering’; … ’This is the way leading to the
cessation of suffering’; … ’These are the taints’; … ’This
is the origin of the taints’; … ’This is the cessation of the
taints’; … ’This is the way leading to the cessation of the
taints.’</P>
<P  >43.
“When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of
sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it was liberated there came the knowledge: ‘It is
liberated.’ I directly knew: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’</P>
<P  >44.
“This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the third
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute. But such pleasant feeling that arose
in me did not invade my mind and remain.</P>

“Aggivessana, I recall teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many
hundreds. Perhaps each person thinks: ‘The recluse Gotama is
teaching the Dhamma especially for me.’ But it should not be so
regarded; the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma to others only to give
them knowledge. When the talk is finished, Aggivessana, then I steady
my mind internally, quieten it, bring it to singleness, and
concentrate it on that same sign of concentration as before, in which
I constantly abide.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote392anc" HREF="#sdendnote392sym"><SUP>cccxcii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“I recall, Aggivessana, in the last month of the hot season, on
returning from my almsround, after my meal I lay out my outer robe
folded in four, and lying down on my right side, I fall asleep
mindful and fully aware.”</P>
<P  >“Some
recluses and brahmins call that abiding in delusion, Master Gotama.”
[250]</P>
<P  >“It
is not in such a way that one is deluded or undeluded, Aggivessana.
As to how one is deluded or undeluded, listen and attend closely to
what I shall say.” - “Yes, sir,” Saccaka the Nigantha’s son
replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >47.
“Him I call deluded, Aggivessana, who has not abandoned the taints
that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in
suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death; for it is
with the non-abandoning of the taints that one is deluded. Him I call
undeluded who has abandoned the taints that defile, bring renewal of
being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth,
ageing, and death; for it is with the abandoning of the taints that
one is undeluded. The Tathagata, Aggivessana, has abandoned the
taints that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in
suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death; he has cut
them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with
them so that they are no longer subject to future arising. Just as a
palm tree whose crown is cut off is incapable of further growth, so
too, the Tathagata has abandoned the taints that defile … done away
with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising.”</P>
<P  >48.
When this was said, Saccaka the Nigantha’s son said: “It is
wonderful, Master Gotama, it is marvellous how when Master Gotama is
spoken to offensively again and again, assailed by discourteous
courses of speech, the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of
his face clears, as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and
fully enlightened. I recall, Master Gotama, engaging Purana Kassapa
in debate, and then he prevaricated, led the talk aside, and showed
anger, hate, and bitterness. But when Master Gotama is spoken to
offensively again and again, assaulted by discourteous courses of
speech, the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of his face
clears, as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and fully
enlightened. I recall, Master Gotama, engaging Makkhali Gosala …
Ajita Kesakambalin … Pakudha Kaccayana … Sanjaya Belatthiputta …
the Nigantha Nataputta in debate, [251] and then he prevaricated, led
the talk aside, and showed anger, hate, and bitterness. But when
Master Gotama is spoken to offensively again and again, assailed by
discourteous courses of speech, the colour of his skin brightens and
the colour of his face clears, as is to be expected of one who is
accomplished and fully enlightened. And now, Master Gotama, we
depart. We are busy and have much to do.”</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time, Aggivessana, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >Then
Saccaka the Nigantha’s son, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One’s words, got up from his seat and departed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote394anc" HREF="#sdendnote394sym"><SUP>cccxciv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

37 Culatanhasankhaya Sutta<BR>The Shorter Discourse on
the<BR>Destruction of Craving</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara’s Mother.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Sakka, ruler of gods, went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, he stood at one side and asked: “Venerable sir, how
in brief is a bhikkhu liberated by the destruction of craving, one
who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate security from bondage,
the ultimate holy life, the ultimate goal, one who is foremost among
gods and humans?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote395anc" HREF="#sdendnote395sym"><SUP>cccxcv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
“Here, ruler of gods, a bhikkhu has heard that nothing is worth
adhering to. When a bhikkhu has heard that nothing is worth adhering
to, he directly knows everything; having directly known everything,
he fully understands everything; having fully understood everything,
whatever feeling he feels, whether pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he abides contemplating impermanence in
those feelings, contemplating fading away, contemplating cessation,
contemplating relinquishment. Contemplating thus, he does not cling
to anything in the world. When he does not cling, he is not agitated.
When he is not agitated, he personally attains Nibbana.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote396anc" HREF="#sdendnote396sym"><SUP>cccxcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
[252] He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being.’ Briefly, it is in this way, ruler of gods,
that a bhikkhu is liberated by the destruction of craving, one who
has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate security from bondage, the
ultimate holy life, the ultimate goal, one who is foremost among gods
and humans.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then Sakka, ruler of gods, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed
One’s words, paid homage to the Blessed One, and keeping him on his
right, he vanished at once.</P>
<P  >5.
Now on that occasion the venerable Maha Moggallana was sitting not
far from the Blessed One. Then he considered: “Did that spirit
penetrate to the meaning of the Blessed One’s words when he
rejoiced, or did he not? Suppose I found out whether he did or not.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or
flex his extended arm, the venerable Maha Moggallana vanished from
the Palace of Migara’s Mother in the Eastern Park and appeared
among the gods of the Thirty-three.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion Sakka, ruler of gods, was furnished and endowed
a hundredfold with the five kinds of heavenly music, and he was
enjoying it in the Pleasure Park of the Single Lotus. When he saw the
venerable Maha Moggallana coming in the distance, he dismissed the
music, went to the venerable Maha Moggallana, and said to him: “Come,
good sir Moggallana! Welcome, good sir Moggallana! It is long, good
sir Moggallana, since you found an opportunity to come here. Sit
down, good sir Moggallana; this seat is ready.”</P>
<P  >The
venerable Maha Moggallana sat down on the seat made ready, and Sakka
took a low seat and sat down at one side. The venerable Maha
Moggallana then asked him:</P>
<P  >8.
“Kosiya,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote397anc" HREF="#sdendnote397sym"><SUP>cccxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
how did the Blessed One state to you in brief deliverance through the
destruction of craving? It would be good if we might also get to hear
that statement.”</P>
<P  >“Good
sir Moggallana, we are so busy, we have so much to do, not only with
our own business, but also with the business of the gods of the
Thirty-three. Besides, good sir Moggallana, what is well heard, well
learned, [253] well attended to, well remembered, does not vanish all
of a sudden. Good sir Moggallana, it once happened that war broke out
between the gods and the titans.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote398anc" HREF="#sdendnote398sym"><SUP>cccxcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
In that war the gods won and the titans were defeated. When I had won
that war and returned from it as a conqueror, I had the Vejayanta
Palace built. Good sir Moggallana, the Vejayanta Palace has a hundred
towers, and each tower has seven hundred upper chambers, and each
upper chamber has seven nymphs, and each nymph has seven maids. Would
you like to see the loveliness of the Vejayanta Palace, good sir
Moggallana?” The venerable Maha Moggallana consented in silence.</P>
<P  >9.
Then Sakka, ruler of gods, and the divine King Vessavana<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote399anc" HREF="#sdendnote399sym"><SUP>cccxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the Vejayanta Palace, giving precedence to the venerable Maha
Moggallana. When the maids of Sakka saw the venerable Maha Moggallana
coming in the distance, they were embarrassed and ashamed and they
went each into their own rooms. Just as a daughter-in-law is
embarrassed and ashamed on seeing her father-in-law, so too, when the
maids of Sakka saw the venerable Maha Moggallana coming, they were
embarrassed and ashamed and they went each into their own rooms.</P>
<P  >10.
Then Sakka, ruler of gods, and the divine King Vessavana had the
venerable Maha Moggallana walk all over and explore the Vejayanta
Palace: “See, good sir Moggallana, this loveliness of the Vejayanta
Palace! See, good sir Moggallana, this loveliness of the Vejayanta
Palace!”</P>
<P  >“It
does the venerable Kosiya credit as one who has formerly made merit;
and whenever human beings see anything lovely, they say: ‘Sirs, it
does credit to the gods of the Thirty-three!’ It does the venerable
Kosiya credit as one who has formerly made merit.”</P>
<P  >11.
Then the venerable Maha Moggallana considered thus: “This spirit is
living much too negligently. What if I stirred up a sense of urgency
in him?” Then the venerable Maha Moggallana performed such a feat
of supernormal power that with the point of his toe he made the
Vejayanta Palace shake and quake and tremble.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote400anc" HREF="#sdendnote400sym"><SUP>cd</SUP></A></SUP>
[254] Sakka and the divine King Vessavana and the gods of the
Thirty-three were filled with wonder and amazement, and they said:
“Sirs, it is wonderful, it is marvellous, what power and might the
recluse has, that with the point of his toe he makes the heavenly
region shake and quake and tremble!”</P>
<P  >12.
When the venerable Maha Moggallana knew that Sakka, ruler of the
gods, was stirred to a sense of urgency with his hair standing on
end, he asked him: “Kosiya, how did the Blessed One state to you in
brief deliverance through the destruction of craving? It would be
good if we might also get to hear that statement.”</P>
<P  >“Good
sir Moggallana, I went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to
him, I stood at one side and said: ‘Venerable sir, … [as in §2]
… of gods and humans?’ When this was said, good sir Moggallana,
the Blessed One told me: ‘Here, ruler of gods, … [as in §3] …
of gods and humans.’ That is how the Blessed One stated to me in
brief deliverance through the destruction of craving, good sir
Moggallana.”</P>
<P  >13.
Then the venerable Maha Moggallana delighted and rejoiced in the
words of Sakka, ruler of gods. [255] Then, just as quickly as a
strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, he
vanished from among the gods of the Thirtythree and appeared in the
Eastern Park in the Palace of Migara’s Mother.</P>
<P  >14.
Then, soon after the venerable Maha Moggallana had gone, the
attendants of Sakka, ruler of gods, asked him: “Good sir, was that
your teacher, the Blessed One?” - “No, good sirs, that was not my
teacher, the Blessed One. That was one of my companions in the holy
life, the venerable Maha Moggallana.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote401anc" HREF="#sdendnote401sym"><SUP>cdi</SUP></A></SUP>
- “Good sir, it is a gain for you that your companion in the holy
life has such power and might. Oh, how much more so that the Blessed
One is your teacher!”</P>
<P  >15.
Then the venerable Maha Moggallana went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and asked him:
“Venerable sir, does the Blessed One recall stating in brief - to a
certain one of the renowned spirits with a great following
-deliverance through the destruction of craving?”</P>
<P  >“I
do recall doing so, Moggallana. Here Sakka, ruler of gods, came to
me, and after paying homage to me, he stood at one side and asked:
‘Venerable sir, how in brief is a bhikkhu liberated by the
destruction of craving, one who has reached the ultimate end, the
ultimate security from bondage, the ultimate holy life, the ultimate
goal, one who is foremost among gods and humans?’ When this was
said, I told him: ‘Here, ruler of gods, a bhikkhu has heard that
nothing is worth adhering to. When a bhikkhu has heard that nothing
is worth adhering to, he directly knows everything; having directly
known everything, he fully understands everything; having fully
understood everything, whatever feeling he feels, whether pleasant or
painful or neitherpainful-nor-pleasant, he abides contemplating
impermanence in those feelings, contemplating fading away,
contemplating cessation, contemplating relinquishment. Contemplating
thus, he does not cling to anything in the world. When he does not
cling, he is not agitated. When he is not agitated, he personally
attains</P>
<P  >Nibbana.
He understands: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived,
[256] what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being.” Briefly, it is in this way, ruler of gods,
that a bhikkhu is liberated by the destruction of craving … one who
is foremost among gods and humans.’ That is how I recall stating in
brief to Sakka, ruler of gods, deliverance through the destruction of
craving.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Maha Moggallana was
satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading39"  >
38. Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta - The Greater Discourse on the
Destruction of Craving</H2>
<H3 >(SETTING)</H3>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named
Sati, son of a fisherman, thus: “As I understand the Dhamma taught
by the Blessed One, it is this same consciousness that runs and
wanders through the round of rebirths, not another. “<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote402anc" HREF="#sdendnote402sym"><SUP>cdii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Several bhikkhus, having heard about this, went to the bhikkhu Sati
and asked him: “Friend Sati, is it true that such a pernicious view
has arisen in you?”</P>
<P  >“Exactly
so, friends. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it
is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of
rebirths, not another.”</P>
<P  >Then
those bhikkhus, desiring to detach him from that pernicious view,
pressed and questioned and cross-questioned him thus: “Friend Sati,
do not say so. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is not good to
misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus.
For in many discourses the Blessed One has stated consciousness to be
dependently arisen, [257] since without a condition there is no
origination of consciousness.”</P>
<P  >Yet
although pressed and questioned and cross-questioned by those
bhikkhus in this way, the bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, still
obstinately adhered to that pernicious view and continued to insist
upon it.</P>
<P  >4.
Since the bhikkhus were unable to detach him from that pernicious
view, they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him,
they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurred, adding:
“Venerable sir, since we could not detach the bhikkhu Sati, son of
a fisherman, from this pernicious view, we have reported this matter
to the Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: “Come, [258]
bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, in my name that
the Teacher calls him.” - “Yes, venerable sir,” he replied, and
he went to the bhikkhu Sati and told him: “The Teacher calls you,
friend Sati.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
friend,” he replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One then
asked him: “Sati, is it true that the following pernicious view has

consciousness arises dependent on the mind and mind-objects, it is

without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless

the middle watch of the night we will lie down on the right side in
the lion’s pose with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and

<H3 >(ABANDONING OF THE HINDRANCES)</H3>
<P  >12.
“What more is to be done? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu resorts to a
secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a
ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open
space, a heap of straw.</P>
<P  >13.
“On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down,
folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect and establishing
mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he
abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from
covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind
free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living
beings; [275] he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred.
Abandoning sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor,
percipient of light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind
from sloth and torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides
unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from
restlessness and remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone
beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his
mind from doubt.</P>
<P  >14.
“Bhikkhus, suppose a man were to take a loan and undertake business
and his business were to succeed so that he could repay all the money
of the old loan and there would remain enough extra to maintain a
wife; then on considering this, he would be glad and full of joy. Or
suppose a man were afflicted, suffering and gravely ill, and his food
would not agree with him and his body had no strength, but later he
would recover from the affliction and his food would agree with him
and his body would regain strength; then on considering this, he
would be glad and full of joy. Or suppose a man were imprisoned in a
prisonhouse, but later he would be released from prison, safe and
secure, with no loss to his property; then on considering this, he
would be glad and full of joy. Or suppose a man were a slave, not
self-dependent but dependent on others, unable to go where he wants,
but later on he would be released from slavery, self-dependent,
independent of others, a freed man able to go where he wants; then on
considering this, [276] he would be glad and full of joy. Or suppose
a man with wealth and property were to enter a road across a desert,
but later on he would cross over the desert, safe and secure, with no
loss to his property; then on considering this, he would be glad and
full of joy. So too, bhikkhus, when these five hindrances are
unabandoned in himself, a bhikkhu sees them respectively as a debt, a
disease, a prisonhouse, slavery, and a road across a desert. But when
these five hindrances have been abandoned in himself, he sees that as
freedom from debt, healthiness, release from prison, freedom from
slavery, and a land of safety.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote418anc" HREF="#sdendnote418sym"><SUP>cdxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(THE FOUR JHANAS)</H3>
<P  >15.
“Having abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the mind
that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the first
jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He makes the rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this
body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. Just as a skilled bath man or
a bath man’s apprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basin and,
sprinkling it gradually with water, kneads it until the moisture wets
his ball of bath powder, soaks it, and pervades it inside and out,
yet the ball itself does not ooze; so too, a bhikkhu makes the
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and
pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</P>
<P  >16.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which
has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.
He makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench,
steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his
whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of
concentration. Just as though there were a lake whose waters welled
up from below [277] and it had no inflow from east, west, north, or
south, and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of
rain, then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make
the cool water drench, steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that
there would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water; so
too, a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of
concentration.</P>
<P  >17.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the fading away as well of rapture, a
bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still
feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the
third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a
pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’ He makes the
pleasure divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this
body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the
pleasure divested of rapture. Just as, in a pond of blue or red or
white lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water
thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and cool water
drenches, steeps, fills, and pervades them to their tips and their
roots, so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by
cool water; so too, a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapture.</P>
<P  >18.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and
with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity. He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so
that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright
mind. Just as though a man were sitting covered from the head down
with a white cloth, so that there would be no part of his whole [278]
body unpervaded by the white cloth; so too, a bhikkhu sits pervading
this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his
whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mind.</P>
<H3 >(THE THREE TRUE KNOWLEDGES)</H3>
<P  >19.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one
birth, two births … (as Sutta 4, §27) … Thus with their aspects
and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. Just as a man
might go from his own village to another village and then back again
to his own village, he might think: ‘I went from my own village to
that village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way,
spoke in such a way, kept silent in such a way; and from that village
I went to that other village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in
such a way, spoke in such a way, kept silent in such a way; and from
that village I came back again to my own village.’ So too, a
bhikkhu recollects his manifold past lives … Thus with their
aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >20.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 4, §29) [279] … Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions. Just as though there were two houses with
doors and a man with good sight standing there between them saw
people entering the houses and coming out and passing to and fro, so
too, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human,
a bhikkhu sees beings passing away and reappearing … and he
understands how beings pass on according to their actions.</P>
<P  >21.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. He understands as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’;
… ’This is the origin of suffering’; … ’This is the
cessation of suffering’; … ’This is the way leading to the
cessation of suffering’; … ’These are the taints’; … ’This
is the origin of the taints’; … ’This is the cessation of the
taints’; … ’This is the way leading to the cessation of the
taints.’</P>
<P  >“When
he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of
sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It is
liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’</P>
<P  >“Just
as if there were a lake in a mountain recess, clear, limpid, and
undisturbed, so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could
see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming
about and resting, he might think: ‘There is this lake, clear,
limpid, and undisturbed, and there are these [280] shells, gravel,
and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about and
resting.’ So too, a bhikkhu understands as it actually is: ‘This
is suffering.’ … He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy
life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no
more coming to any state of being.’</P>

40. Cula-Assapura Sutta - The Shorter Discourse at Assapura</H2>
<P  >[281]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Angan country at a town of the Angans named Assapura. There the
Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable
sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“‘Recluses, recluses,’ bhikkhus, that is how people perceive
you. And when you are asked, ‘What are you?’ you claim that you
are recluses. Since that is what you are designated and what you
claim to be, you should train thus: ‘We will practise the way
proper to the recluse<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote422anc" HREF="#sdendnote422sym"><SUP>cdxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
so that our designations may be true and our claims genuine, and so
that the services of those whose robes, almsfood, resting place, and
medicinal requisites we use shall bring them great fruit and benefit,
and so that our going forth shall not be in vain but fruitful and
fertile.’</P>
<P  >3.
“How, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu not practise the way proper to the
recluse? For so long as a bhikkhu who is covetous has not abandoned
covetousness, who has a mind of ill will has not abandoned ill will,
who is angry has not abandoned anger, who is revengeful has not
abandoned revenge, who is contemptuous has not abandoned contempt,
who is domineering has not abandoned his domineering attitude, who is
envious has not abandoned envy, who is avaricious has not abandoned
avarice, who is fraudulent has not abandoned fraud, who is deceitful
has not abandoned deceit, who has evil wishes has not abandoned evil
wishes, who has wrong view has not abandoned wrong view,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote423anc" HREF="#sdendnote423sym"><SUP>cdxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
for so long he does not practise the way proper to the recluse, I
say, because of his failure to abandon these stains for the recluse,
these faults for the recluse, these dregs for the recluse, which are
grounds for rebirth in a state of deprivation and whose results are
to be experienced in an unhappy destination.</P>
<P  >4.
“Suppose the weapon called a mataja, well whetted on both edges,
were enclosed and encased in a patchwork sheath. I say that such a
bhikkhu’s going forth is comparable to that.</P>
<P  >5.
“I do not say that the recluse’s status comes about in a
patchwork-cloak wearer through the mere wearing of the patchwork
cloak, nor in a naked ascetic through mere nakedness, nor in a
dweller in dust and dirt through mere dust and dirt, nor in a washer
in water through mere washing in water, nor in a treeroot dweller
through mere [282] dwelling at the root of a tree, nor in an open-air
dweller through mere dwelling in the open air, nor in a practitioner
of continuous standing through mere continuous standing, nor in a
taker of food at stated intervals through mere taking of food at
stated intervals, nor in a reciter of incantations through mere
recitation of incantations; nor do I say that the recluse’s status
comes about in a matted-hair ascetic through mere wearing of the hair
matted.</P>
<P  >6.
“Bhikkhus, if through the mere wearing of the patchwork cloak a
patchwork-cloak wearer who was covetous abandoned covetousness, who
had a mind of ill will abandoned ill will … who had wrong view
abandoned wrong view, then his friends and companions, his kinsmen
and relatives, would make him a patchwork-cloak wearer as soon as he
was born and have him undertake the patchwork-cloak wearing thus:
‘Come, my dear, be a patchwork-cloak wearer so that, as a
patchwork-cloak wearer, when you are covetous you will abandon
covetousness, when you have a mind of ill will you will abandon ill
will … when you have wrong view you will abandon wrong view.’ But
I see here a patchwork-cloak wearer who is covetous, who has a mind
of ill will … who has wrong view; and that is why I do not say that
the recluse’s status comes about in a patchwork-cloak wearer
through the mere wearing of the patchwork cloak.</P>
<P  >“If
through mere nakedness a naked ascetic who was covetous abandoned
covetousness … If through mere dust and dirt … if through mere

recluse, these faults for the recluse, these dregs for the recluse,
which are grounds for rebirth in a state of deprivation and whose

“He sees himself purified of all these evil unwholesome states, he
sees himself liberated from them. When he sees this, gladness is born

feels pleasure; in one who feels pleasure, the mind becomes

“He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with

nobles goes forth from the home life into homelessness, and after
encountering the</P>

and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata, develops loving-kindness,
compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity, and thereby gains
internal peace, then because of that internal peace he practises the

1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering
by stages in the Kosalan Country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and
eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahmin village named Sala.</P>
<P  >2.
The brahmin householders of Sala heard: “The recluse Gotama, the
son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been
wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and
has come to Sala. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread
to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with
its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this generation with its
recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, which he has
himself realised with direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma good in
the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the
right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is
utterly perfect and pure.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then the brahmin householders of Sala went to the Blessed One. Some
paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their hands in
reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one
side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One’s
presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at
one side.</P>
<P  >4.
When they were seated, they said to the Blessed One: “Master
Gotama, what is the cause and condition why some beings here, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in states of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell?
And what is the cause and condition why some beings here, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world?”</P>
<P  >5.
“Householders, it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with
the Dhamma, by reason of unrighteous conduct that some beings here,
on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in states of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.
It is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, by reason
of righteous conduct that some beings here, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, reappear in a happy destination, even in the
heavenly world.” [286]</P>
<P  >6.
“We do not understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama’s
utterance, which he has spoken in brief without expounding the
detailed meaning. It would be good if Master Gotama would teach us
the Dhamma so that we might understand the detailed meaning of his
utterance.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
householders, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >7.
“Householders, there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in
accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct. There are four kinds
of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous
conduct. There are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance
with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.</P>
<P  >8.
“And how, householders, are there three kinds of bodily conduct not
in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone
kills living beings; he is murderous, bloodyhanded, given to blows
and violence, merciless to living beings. He takes what is not given;
he takes by way of theft the wealth and property of others in the
village or forest. He misconducts himself in sensual pleasures; he
has intercourse with women who are protected by their mother, father,
mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives, who have a husband,
who are protected by law, and even with those who are garlanded in
token of betrothal. That is how there are three kinds of bodily
conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.</P>
<P  >9.
“And how, householders, are there four kinds of verbal conduct not
in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone
speaks falsehood; when summoned to a court, or to a meeting, or to
his relatives’ presence, or to his guild, or to the royal family’s
presence, and questioned as a witness thus: ‘So, good man, tell
what you know,’ not knowing, he says, ‘I know,’ or knowing, he
says, ‘I do not know’; not seeing, he says, ‘I see,’ or
seeing, he says, ‘I do not see’; in full awareness he speaks
falsehood for his own ends, or for another’s ends, or for some
trifling worldly end. He speaks maliciously; he repeats elsewhere
what he has heard here in order to divide [those people] from these,
or he repeats to these people what he has heard elsewhere in order to
divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who divides those
who are united, a creator of divisions, who enjoys discord, rejoices
in discord, delights in discord, a speaker of words that create
discord. He speaks harshly; he utters such words as are rough, hard.,
hurtful to others, offensive to others, bordering on anger,
unconducive to concentration. [287] He is a gossip; he speaks at the
wrong time, speaks what is not fact, speaks what is useless, speaks
contrary to the Dhamma and the Discipline; at the wrong time he
speaks such words as are worthless, unreasonable, immoderate, and
unbeneficial. That is how there are four kinds of verbal conduct not
in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct.</P>
<P  >10.
“And how, householders, are there three kinds of mental conduct not
in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone is
covetous; he covets the wealth and property of others thus: ‘Oh,
may what belongs to another be mine!’ Or he has a mind of ill will
and intentions of hate thus: ‘May these beings be slain and
slaughtered, may they be cut off, perish, or be annihilated!’ Or he
has wrong view, distorted vision, thus: ‘There is nothing given,
nothing offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and
bad actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no
beings who are reborn spontaneously; no good and virtuous recluses
and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct
knowledge and declare this world and the other world.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote425anc" HREF="#sdendnote425sym"><SUP>cdxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how there are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance
with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct. So, householders, it is by
reason of such conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, by reason
of such unrighteous conduct that some beings here on the dissolution
of the body, after death, reappear in states of deprivation, in an
unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.</P>
<P  >11.
“Householders, there are three kinds of bodily conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct. There are four kinds
of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct.
There are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct.</P>
<P  >12.
“And how, householders, are there three kinds of bodily conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone,
abandoning the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living
beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gentle and kindly, he abides
compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is
not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; he does not
take by way of theft the wealth and property of others in the village
or in the forest. Abandoning misconduct in sensual pleasures, he
abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasures; he does not have
intercourse with women who are protected by their mother, father,
mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives, who have a husband,
who are protected by law, or with those who are garlanded in token of
betrothal. That is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct. [288]</P>
<P  >13.
“And how, householders, are there four kinds of verbal conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone,
abandoning false speech, abstains from false speech; when summoned to
a court, or to a meeting, or to his relatives’ presence, or to his
guild, or to the royal family’s presence, and questioned as a
witness thus: ‘So, good man, tell what you know,’ not knowing, he
says, ‘I do not know,’ or knowing, he says, ‘I know’; not
seeing, he says, ‘I do not see,’ or seeing, he says, ‘I see’;
he does not in full awareness speak falsehood for his own ends, or
for another’s ends, or for some trifling worldly end. Abandoning
malicious speech, he abstains from malicious speech; he does not
repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those
people] from these, nor does he repeat to these people what he has
heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people] from those; thus he
is one who reunites those who are divided, a promoter of friendships,
who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord, delights in concord, a
speaker of words that promote concord. Abandoning harsh speech, he
abstains from harsh speech; he speaks such words as are gentle,
pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to the heart, are courteous,
desired by many, and agreeable to many. Abandoning gossip, he
abstains from gossip; he speaks at the right time, speaks what is
fact, speaks on what is good, speaks on the Dhamma and the
Discipline; at the right time he speaks such words as are worth
recording, reasonable, moderate, and beneficial. That is how there
are four kinds of verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma,
righteous conduct.</P>
<P  >14.
“And how, householders, are there three kinds of mental conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone is not
covetous; he does not covet the wealth and property of others thus:
‘Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!’ His mind is without
ill will and he has intentions free from hate thus: ‘May these
beings be free from enmity, affliction and anxiety! May they live
happily!’ He has right view, undistorted vision, thus: ‘There is
what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed; there is
fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world and the
other world; there is mother and father; there are beings who are
reborn spontaneously; there are good and virtuous recluses and
brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct
knowledge and declare this world and the other world.’ That is how
there are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct. So, householders, it is by reason of such
conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, by reason of such righteous
conduct that some beings here, on the dissolution of the body, after
death, reappear in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world.

“If, householders, one who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: ‘Oh, that on the
dissolution of the body, after death, I might reappear in the company
of well-to-do nobles!’ it is possible that, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, he will reappear in the company of well-to-do
nobles. Why is that? Because he observes conduct that is in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct.</P>
<P  >16-17.
“If, householders, one who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: ‘Oh, that on the
dissolution of the body, after death, I might reappear in the company

householders!’ it is possible that, on the dissolution of the body,
after death, he will reappear in the company of</P>
<P  >well-to-do
householders. Why is that? Because he observes conduct that is in

“If, householders, one who observes conduct in accordance with the

of the gods of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Why is that?
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous
conduct.</P>
<P  >43.
“If, householders, one who observes conduct in accordance with the

myself with direct knowledge I might here and now enter upon and

by realising for himself with direct knowledge, he will here and now

that? Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma,

When this was said, the brahmin householders of Sala said to the
Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master
Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as
though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a
lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms. We go to
Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama accept us as lay followers who
have gone to him for refuge for life.”</P>

42. Veranjaka Sutta - The Brahmins of Veranja</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion some brahmin householders of Veranja were on a
visit to Savatthi for some business or other. [291]</P>
<P  >3-44.
[The text of this sutta is the same as that of Sutta 41, except that
where the preceding sutta is phrased in terms of “conduct not in
accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct” (§§7-10) and
“conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct”
(§§11-14), this sutta is phrased in terms of “one who does not
observe conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, one of unrighteous
conduct” and “one who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, one of righteous conduct”; substitute “Veranja” for
“Sala” throughout.]</P>

43. Mahavedalla Sutta - The Greater Series of Questions and Answers</H2>
<P  >[292]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >Then,
when it was evening, the venerable Maha Kotthita rose from
meditation, went to the venerable Sariputta, and exchanged greetings
with him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote428anc" HREF="#sdendnote428sym"><SUP>cdxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and said to the venerable Sariputta:</P>
<H3 >(WISDOM)</H3>
<P  >2.
“‘One who is unwise, one who is unwise’ is said, friend. With
reference to what is this said, ‘one who is unwise’?”</P>
<P  >“‘One
does not wisely understand, one does not wisely understand,’
friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is unwise.’ And what
doesn’t one wisely understand? One does not wisely understand:
‘This is suffering’; one does not wisely understand: ‘This is
the origin of suffering’; one does not wisely understand: ‘This
is the cessation of suffering’; one does not wisely understand:
‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ ‘One
does not wisely understand, one does not wisely understand,’
friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is unwise.’“</P>
<P  >Saying,
“Good, friend,” the venerable Maha Kotthita delighted and
rejoiced in the venerable Sariputta’s words. Then he asked him a
further question:</P>
<P  >3.
“‘One who is wise, one who is wise,’ is said, friend. With
reference to what is this said, ‘one who is wise’?”</P>
<P  >“‘One
wisely understands, one wisely understands,’ friend; that is why it
is said, ‘one who is wise.’ What does one wisely understand? One
wisely understands: ‘This is suffering’; one wisely understands:
‘This is the origin of suffering’; one wisely understands: ‘This
is the cessation of suffering’; one wisely understands: ‘This is
the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ ‘One wisely
understands, one wisely understands,’ friend; that is why it is

“‘Consciousness, consciousness’ is said, friend. With reference
to what is ‘consciousness’ said?”</P>
<P  >“‘It
cognizes, it cognizes,’ friend; that is why ‘consciousness’ is
said.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote430anc" HREF="#sdendnote430sym"><SUP>cdxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
What does it cognize? It cognizes: ‘[This is] pleasant’; it

friend; that is why ‘consciousness’ is said.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote431anc" HREF="#sdendnote431sym"><SUP>cdxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Wisdom and consciousness, friend - are these states conjoined or
disjoined? And is it possible to separate each of these states from
the other in order to describe the difference between them?”</P>
<P  >“Wisdom
and consciousness, friend - these states are conjoined, not
disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states from
the other in order to describe the difference between them. For what
one wisely understands, that one cognizes, and what one cognizes,
that one wisely understands. [293] That is why these states are
conjoined, not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of
these states from the other in order to describe the difference
between them.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote432anc" HREF="#sdendnote432sym"><SUP>cdxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“What is the difference, friend, between wisdom and consciousness,
these states that are conjoined, not disjoined?”</P>
<P  >“The
difference, friend, between wisdom and consciousness, these states
that are conjoined, not disjoined, is this: wisdom is to be
developed, consciousness is to be fully understood.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote433anc" HREF="#sdendnote433sym"><SUP>cdxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(FEELING)</H3>
<P  >7.
“‘Feeling, feeling’ is said, friend. With reference to what is
‘feeling’ said?”</P>
<P  >“‘It
feels, it feels,’ friend; that is why ‘feeling’ is said. What
does it feel? It feels pleasure, it feels pain, it feels
neither-pain-norpleasure. ‘It feels, it feels,’ friend, that is

“‘Perception, perception,’ is said, friend. With reference to
what is ‘perception’ said?”</P>
<P  >“‘It
perceives, it perceives,’ friend; that is why ‘perception’ is
said. What does it perceive? It perceives blue, it perceives yellow,
it perceives red, and it perceives white. ‘It perceives, it
perceives,’ friend; that is why ‘perception’ is said.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote435anc" HREF="#sdendnote435sym"><SUP>cdxxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

them?”</P>
<P  >“Feeling,
perception, and consciousness, friend - these states are conjoined,
not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states
from the others in order to describe the difference between them. For
what one feels, that one perceives; and what one perceives, that one
cognizes. That is why these states are conjoined, not disjoined, and

“Friend, what can be known by purified mind-consciousness released
from the five faculties?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
by purified mind-consciousness released from the five faculties the
base of infinite space can be known thus: ‘Space is infinite’;
the base of infinite consciousness can be known thus: ‘Consciousness
is infinite’; and the base of nothingness can be known thus: ‘There
is nothing.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote437anc" HREF="#sdendnote437sym"><SUP>cdxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

purpose of wisdom, friend, is direct knowledge, its purpose is full

<H3 >(RIGHT VIEW)</H3>

13. “Friend, how many conditions are there for the arising of right
view?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
there are two conditions for the arising of right view: the voice of
another and wise attention. These are the two conditions for the
arising of right view.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote440anc" HREF="#sdendnote440sym"><SUP>cdxl</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Friend, by how many factors is right view assisted when it has
deliverance of mind for its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit
and benefit, when it has deliverance by wisdom for its fruit,
deliverance by wisdom for its fruit and benefit?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
right view is assisted by five factors when it has deliverance of
mind for its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit and benefit,
when it has deliverance by wisdom for its fruit, deliverance by
wisdom for its fruit and benefit. Here, friend, right view is
assisted by virtue, learning, discussion, serenity, and insight.
Right view assisted by these five factors has deliverance of mind for
its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit and benefit; it has
deliverance by wisdom for its fruit, deliverance by wisdom for its

fine-material being, and immaterial being.”</P>
<P  >16.
“Friend, how is renewal of being in the future generated?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
renewal of being in the future is generated through the delighting in

<H3 >(THE FIRST JHANA)</H3>
<P  >18.
“Friend, what is the first jhana?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
friend, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. This is called the first
jhana.”</P>

“Friend, how many factors does the first jhana have?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
the first jhana has five factors. Here, when a bhikkhu has entered
upon the first jhana, there occur applied thought, sustained thought,
rapture, pleasure, and unification of mind. That is how the first
jhana has five factors.”</P>
<P  >20.
“Friend, how many factors are abandoned in the first jhana and how
many factors are possessed?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
in the first jhana five factors are abandoned and five factors are
possessed. Here, when a bhikkhu has entered upon the first jhana,
sensual desire is abandoned, ill will is abandoned, sloth and torpor
are abandoned, restlessness and remorse [295] are abandoned, and
doubt is abandoned; and there occur applied thought, sustained
thought, rapture, pleasure, and unification of mind. That is how in
the first jhana five factors are abandoned and five factors are
possessed.”</P>
<H3 >(THE FIVE FACULTIES)</H3>
<P  >21.
“Friend, these five faculties each have a separate field, a
separate domain, and do not experience each other’s field and
domain, that is, the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty,
the tongue faculty, and the body faculty. Now of these five
faculties, each having a separate field, a separate domain, not

their fields and domains.”</P>

ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, and the body
faculty - what do these five faculties stand in dependence on?”</P>

now, friend, we understood the venerable Sariputta to have said:
‘Vitality stands in dependence on heat’; and now we understand
him to say: ‘Heat stands in dependence on vitality.’ How should
the meaning of these statements be regarded?”</P>
<P  >“In
that case, friend, I shall give you a simile, for some wise men here
understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile. Just as
when an oil-lamp is burning, its radiance is seen in dependence on
its flame and its flame is seen in dependence on its radiance; so

dependence on vitality.”</P>
<H3 >(VITAL FORMATIONS)</H3>
<P  >23.
“Friend, are vital formations states of feeling or are vital
formations one thing and states of feeling another?” [296]</P>
<P  >“Vital
formations, friend, are not states of feeling.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote446anc" HREF="#sdendnote446sym"><SUP>cdxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
If vital formations were states of feeling, then when a bhikkhu has
entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling, he would not be
seen to emerge from it. Because vital formations are one thing and
states of feeling another, when a bhikkhu has entered upon the
cessation of perception and feeling, he can be seen to emerge from
it.”</P>

discarded and forsaken, left lying senseless like a log?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote447anc" HREF="#sdendnote447sym"><SUP>cdxlvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Friend,
when this body is bereft of three states - vitality, heat, and
consciousness - it is then discarded and forsaken, left lying
senseless like a log.”</P>
<P  >25.
“Friend, what is the difference between one who is dead, who has
completed his time, and a bhikkhu who has entered upon the cessation
of perception and feeling?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
in the case of one who is dead, who has completed his time, his
bodily formations have ceased and subsided, his verbal formations
have ceased and subsided, his mental formations have ceased and
subsided, his vitality is exhausted, his heat has been dissipated,
and his faculties are fully broken up. In the case of a bhikkhu who
has entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling, his bodily
formations have ceased and subsided, his verbal formations have
ceased and subsided, his mental formations have ceased and subsided,
but his vitality is not exhausted, his heat has not been dissipated,
and his faculties become exceptionally clear.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote448anc" HREF="#sdendnote448sym"><SUP>cdxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the difference between one who is dead, who has completed his

<H3 >(DELIVERANCE OF MIND)</H3>
<P  >26.
“Friend, how many conditions are there for the attainment of the
neither-painful-nor-pleasant deliverance of mind?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
there are four conditions for the attainment of the
neither-painful-nor-pleasant deliverance of mind: here, with the
abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance
of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth
jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness
due to equanimity. These are the four conditions for the attainment
of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant deliverance of mind.”</P>
<P  >27.
“Friend, how many conditions are there for the attainment of the
signless deliverance of mind?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
there are two conditions for the attainment of the signless

<P  >“Friend,
there are three conditions for the persistence of the signless
deliverance of mind: [297] non-attention to all signs, attention to
the signless element, and the prior determination [of its duration].
These are the three conditions for the persistence of the signless

“Friend, the immeasurable deliverance of mind, the deliverance of
mind through nothingness, the deliverance of mind through voidness,

<P  >31.
“What, friend, is the way in which these states are different in

likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and
everywhere, and to all as to himself, he abides pervading the
all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness,
abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill

compassion … He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued

immeasurable deliverance of mind.</P>

“And what, friend, is the deliverance of mind through nothingness?
Here, with the complete surmounting of the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ a bhikkhu enters

deliverance of mind through nothingness.</P>
<P  >33.
“And what, friend, is the deliverance of mind through voidness?

44. Culavedalla Sutta - The Shorter Series of Questions and Answers</H2>
<P  >[299]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Then the
lay follower Visakha went to the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote459anc" HREF="#sdendnote459sym"><SUP>cdlix</SUP></A></SUP>
and after paying homage to her, he sat down at one side and asked
her:</P>
<H3 >(PERSONALITY)</H3>
<P  >2.
“Lady, ‘personality, personality’ is said. What is called
personality by the Blessed One?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, these five aggregates affected by clinging are called
personality by the Blessed One; that is, the material form aggregate
affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the
perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate
affected by clinging, and the consciousness aggregate affected by
clinging. These five aggregates affected by clinging are called
personality by the Blessed One.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote460anc" HREF="#sdendnote460sym"><SUP>cdlx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Saying,
“Good, lady,” the lay follower Visakha delighted and rejoiced in
the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna’s words. Then he asked her a further
question:</P>
<P  >3.
“Lady, ‘origin of personality, origin of personality’ is said.
What is called the origin of personality by the Blessed One?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, it is craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied
by delight and lust, and delights in this and that; that is, craving
for sensual pleasures, craving for being, and craving for non-being.
This is called the origin of personality by the Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >4.
“Lady, ‘cessation of personality, cessation of personality’ is
said. What is called the cessation of personality by the Blessed
One?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, it is the remainderless fading away and ceasing, the giving
up, relinquishing, letting go, and rejecting of that same craving.
This is called the cessation of personality by the Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >5.
“Lady, ‘the way leading to the cessation of personality, the way
leading to the cessation of personality’ is said. What is called
the way leading to the cessation of personality by the Blessed One?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, it is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view,
right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.”</P>
<P  >6.
“Lady, is that clinging the same as these five aggregates affected
by clinging, or is the clinging something apart from the five
aggregates affected by clinging?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, that clinging is neither the same as these five aggregates
affected by clinging [300] nor is clinging something apart from the
five aggregates affected by clinging. It is the desire and lust in
regard to the five aggregates affected by clinging that is the
clinging there.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote461anc" HREF="#sdendnote461sym"><SUP>cdlxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(PERSONALITY VIEW)</H3>
<P  >7.
“Lady, how does personality view come to be?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
friend Visakha, an untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for
noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who
has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in
their Dhamma, regards material form as self, or self as possessed of
material form, or material form as in self, or self as in material
form. He regards feeling as self, or self as possessed of feeling, or
feeling as in self, or self as in feeling. He regards perception as
self, or self as possessed of perception, or perception as in self,
or self as in perception. He regards formations as self, or self as
possessed of formations, or formations as in self, or self as in
formations. He regards consciousness as self, or self as possessed of
consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in
consciousness. That is how personality view comes to be.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote462anc" HREF="#sdendnote462sym"><SUP>cdlxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
“Lady, how does personality view not come to be?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
friend Visakha, a well-taught noble disciple, who has regard for
noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has
regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma,
does not regard material form as self, or self as possessed of
material form, or material form as in self, or self as in material
form. He does not regard feeling as self, or self as possessed of
feeling, or feeling as in self, or self as in feeling. He does not
regard perception as self, or self as possessed of perception, or
perception as in self, or self as in perception. He does not regard
formations as self, or self as possessed of formations, or formations
as in self, or self as in formations. He does not regard
consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or
consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how
personality view does not come to be.”</P>
<H3 >(THE NOBLE EIGHTFOLD PATH)</H3>
<P  >9.
“Lady, what is the Noble Eightfold Path?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, it is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view,
right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.”</P>
<P  >10.
“Lady, is the Noble Eightfold Path conditioned or unconditioned?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, the Noble Eightfold Path is [301] conditioned.” 11. “Lady,
are the three aggregates included by the Noble Eightfold Path, or is
the Noble Eightfold Path included by the three aggregates?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote463anc" HREF="#sdendnote463sym"><SUP>cdlxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“The
three aggregates are not included by the Noble Eightfold Path, friend
Visakha, but the Noble Eightfold Path is included by the three
aggregates. Right speech, right action, and right livelihood - these
states are included in the aggregate of virtue. Right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration - these states are included in
the aggregate of concentration. Right view and right intention -
these states are included in the aggregate of wisdom.”</P>
<H3 >(CONCENTRATION)</H3>
<P  >12.
“Lady, what is concentration? What is the basis of concentration?
What is the equipment of concentration? What is the development of
concentration?”</P>
<P  >“Unification
of mind, friend Visakha, is concentration; the four foundations of
mindfulness are the basis of concentration; the four right kinds of
striving are the equipment of concentration; the repetition,
development, and cultivation of these same states is the development
of concentration therein.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote464anc" HREF="#sdendnote464sym"><SUP>cdlxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(FORMATIONS)</H3>
<P  >13.
“Lady, how many formations are there?”</P>
<P  >“There
are these three formations, friend Visakha: the bodily formation, the
verbal formation, and the mental formation.”</P>
<P  >14.
“But, lady, what is the bodily formation? What is the verbal
formation? What is the mental formation?”</P>
<P  >“In-breathing
and out-breathing, friend Visakha, are the bodily formation; applied
thought and sustained thought are the verbal formation; perception
and feeling are the mental formation.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote465anc" HREF="#sdendnote465sym"><SUP>cdlxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
“But, lady, why are in-breathing and out-breathing the bodily
formation? Why are applied thought and sustained thought the verbal
formation? Why are perception and feeling the mental formation?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, in-breathing and out-breathing are bodily, these are states
bound up with the body; that is why in-breathing and out-breathing
are the bodily formation. First one applies thought and sustains
thought, and subsequently one breaks out into speech; that is why
applied thought and sustained thought are the verbal formation.
Perception and feeling are mental, these are states bound up with the
mind; that is why perception and feeling are the mental formation.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote466anc" HREF="#sdendnote466sym"><SUP>cdlxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(THE ATTAINMENT OF CESSATION)</H3>
<P  >16.
“Lady, how does the attainment of the cessation of perception and
feeling come to be?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and
feeling, it does not occur to him: ‘I shall attain the cessation of
perception and feeling,’ or ‘I am attaining the cessation of
perception and feeling,’ or ‘I have attained the cessation of
perception and feeling’; but rather his mind has previously been
developed in such a way that it leads him to that state.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote467anc" HREF="#sdendnote467sym"><SUP>cdlxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
[302]</P>
<P  >17.
“Lady, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and
feeling, which states cease first in him: the bodily formation, the
verbal formation, or the mental formation?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and
feeling, first the verbal formation ceases, then the bodily
formation, then the mental formation.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote468anc" HREF="#sdendnote468sym"><SUP>cdlxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >18.
“Lady, how does emergence from the attainment of the cessation of
perception and feeling come to be?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, it does not occur to him: ‘I
shall emerge from the attainment of the cessation of perception and
feeling,’ or ‘I am emerging from the attainment of the cessation
of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I have emerged from the
attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling’; but rather
his mind has previously been developed in such a way that it leads
him to that state.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote469anc" HREF="#sdendnote469sym"><SUP>cdlxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >19.
“Lady, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, which states arise first in him:
the bodily formation, the verbal formation, or the mental formation?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, first the mental formation
arises, then the bodily formation, then the verbal formation.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote470anc" HREF="#sdendnote470sym"><SUP>cdlxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >20.
“Lady, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact touch
him?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, three kinds of contact touch
him: voidness contact, signless contact, desireless contact.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote471anc" HREF="#sdendnote471sym"><SUP>cdlxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >21.
“Lady, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, to what does his mind incline,
to what does it lean, to what does it tend?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the
cessation of perception and feeling, his mind inclines to seclusion,
leans to seclusion, tends to seclusion.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote472anc" HREF="#sdendnote472sym"><SUP>cdlxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(FEELING)</H3>
<P  >22.
“Lady, how many kinds of feeling are there?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, there are three kinds of feeling: pleasant feeling, painful
feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.”</P>
<P  >23.
“But, lady, what is pleasant feeling? What is painful feeling? What
is neither painful-nor-pleasant feeling?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, whatever is felt bodily or mentally as pleasant and soothing
is pleasant feeling. Whatever is felt bodily or mentally as painful
and hurting is painful feeling. Whatever is felt bodily or mentally
as neither soothing nor hurting [303] is neither-painful-nor-pleasant
feeling.”</P>
<P  >24.
“Lady, what is pleasant and what is painful in regard to pleasant
feeling? What is painful and what is pleasant in regard to painful
feeling? What is pleasant and what is painful in regard to
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, pleasant feeling is pleasant when it persists and painful
when it changes. Painful feeling is painful when it persists and
pleasant when it changes. Neither-painful-norpleasant feeling is
pleasant when there is knowledge [of it] and painful when there is no
knowledge [of it].”</P>
<H3 >(UNDERLYING TENDENCIES)</H3>
<P  >25.
“Lady, what underlying tendency underlies pleasant feeling? What
underlying tendency underlies painful feeling? What underlying
tendency underlies neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?”</P>

Visakha, the underlying tendency to lust underlies pleasant feeling.
The underlying tendency to aversion underlies painful feeling. The

neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote473anc" HREF="#sdendnote473sym"><SUP>cdlxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Lady, does the underlying tendency to lust underlie all pleasant
feeling? Does the underlying tendency to aversion underlie all
painful feeling? Does the underlying tendency to ignorance underlie
all neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Visakha, the underlying tendency to lust does not underlie all
pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to aversion does not
underlie all painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance
does not underlie all neither-painful-norpleasant feeling.”</P>
<P  >27.
“Lady, what should be abandoned in regard to pleasant feeling? What

neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.”</P>
<P  >28.
“Lady, does the underlying tendency to lust have to be abandoned in

<P  >“Here,
friend Visakha, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first

not able to grasp the limit to questions.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote479anc" HREF="#sdendnote479sym"><SUP>cdlxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
For the holy life, friend Visakha, merges in Nibbana, culminates in

Blessed One and ask him about the meaning of this. As the Blessed One
explains it to you, so you should remember it.”</P>
<H3 >(CONCLUSION)</H3>
<P  >30.
Then the lay follower Visakha, having delighted and rejoiced in the
bhikkhuni Dhammadinna’s words, rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to her, keeping her on his right, he went to the Blessed One.
After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told the
Blessed One his entire conversation with the bhikkhuni Dhammadinna.
When he finished speaking, the Blessed One told him:</P>
<P  >31.
“The bhikkhuni Dhammadinna is wise, Visakha, the bhikkhuni
Dhammadinna has great wisdom. If you had asked me the meaning of
this, I would have explained it to you [305] in the same way that the
bhikkhunl Dhammadinna has explained it. Such is its meaning, and so
you should remember it.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote480anc" HREF="#sdendnote480sym"><SUP>cdlxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>

they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, there are four ways of undertaking things. What are the
four? There is a way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and
ripens in the future as pain. There is a way of undertaking things
that is painful now and ripens in the future as pain. There is a way
of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as
pleasure. There is a way of undertaking things that is pleasant now
and ripens in the future as pleasure.</P>
<P  >3.
“What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is pleasant
now and ripens in the future as pain? Bhikkhus, there are certain
recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘There is no
harm in sensual pleasures.’ They take to gulping down sensual
pleasures and divert themselves with women wanderers who wear their
hair bound in a topknot. They say thus: ‘What future fear do these
good recluses and brahmins see in sensual pleasures when they speak
of abandoning sensual pleasures and describe the full understanding
of sensual pleasures? Pleasant is the touch of this woman wanderer’s
tender soft downy arm!’ Thus they take to gulping down sensual
pleasures, and having done so, on the dissolution of the body, after
death, they reappear in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy
destination, in perdition, even in hell. There they feel painful,
racking, piercing feelings. They say thus: ‘This is the future fear
those good recluses and brahmins saw in sensual pleasures when they
spoke of abandoning sensual pleasures and described the full
understanding of sensual pleasures. For it is by reason of sensual
pleasures, [306] owing to sensual pleasures, that we are now feeling
painful, racking, piercing feelings.’</P>
<P  >4.
“Bhikkhus, suppose that in the last month of the hot season a
maluva-creeper pod burst open and a maluva-creeper seed fell at the
foot of a sala tree. Then a deity living in that tree became fearful,
perturbed, and frightened; but the deity’s friends and companions,
kinsmen and relatives - garden deities, park deities, tree deities,
and deities inhabiting medicinal herbs, grass, and forest-monarch
trees - gathered together and reassured that deity thus: ‘Have no
fear, sir, have no fear. Perhaps a peacock will swallow the
maluva-creeper seed or a wild animal will eat it or a forest fire
will burn it or woodsmen will carry it off or white ants will devour
it or it may not even be fertile.’ But no peacock swallowed that
seed, no wild animal ate it, no forest fire burned it, no woodsmen
carried it off, no white ants devoured it, and it was in fact
fertile. Then, being moistened by rain from a rainbearing cloud, the
seed in due course sprouted and the maluva creeper’s tender soft
downy tendril wound itself around that sala tree. Then the deity
living in the sala tree thought: ‘What future fear did my friends
and companions, kinsmen and relatives … see in that maluva-creeper
seed when they gathered together and reassured me as they did?
Pleasant is the touch of this maluva creeper’s tender soft downy
tendril!’ Then the creeper enfolded the sala tree, made a canopy
over it, draped a curtain all around it, and split the main branches
of the tree. The deity who lived in the tree then realised: ‘This
is the future fear they saw in that maluva-creeper seed. [307]
Because of that maluva-creeper seed I am now feeling painful,
racking, piercing feelings.’</P>
<P  >“So
too, bhikkhus, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine
and view is this: ‘There is no harm in sensual pleasures.’ …
They say thus: ‘This is the future fear those good recluses and
brahmins saw in sensual pleasures … that we are now feeling
painful, racking, piercing feelings.’ This is called the way of
undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as
pain.</P>
<P  >5.
“And what, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
painful now and ripens in the future as pain? Here, bhikkhus, someone
goes naked, rejecting conventions, licking his hands, not coming when
asked, not stopping when asked … (as Sutta 12, §45) [308] … He
dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily
including the evening. Thus in such a variety of ways he dwells
pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body. On the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.
This is called the way of undertaking things that is painful now and
ripens in the future as pain.</P>
<P  >6.
“And what, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
painful now and ripens in the future as pleasure? Here, bhikkhus,
someone by nature has strong lust, and he constantly experiences pain
and grief born of lust; by nature he has strong hate, and he
constantly experiences pain and grief born of hate; by nature he has
strong delusion, and he constantly experiences pain and grief born of
delusion. Yet in pain and grief, weeping with tearful face, he leads
the perfect and pure holy life. On the dissolution of the body, after
death, he reappears in a happy destination, even in the heavenly
world. This is called the way of undertaking things that is painful
now and ripens in the future as pleasure.</P>
<P  >7.
“And what, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
pleasant now and ripens in the future as pleasure? Here, bhikkhus,
someone by nature does not have strong lust, and he does not
constantly experience pain and grief born of lust; by nature he does
not have strong hate, and he does not constantly experience pain and
grief born of hate; by nature he does not have strong delusion, [309]
and he does not constantly experience pain and grief born of
delusion. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the first jhana …
With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon
and abides in the second jhana … With the fading away as well of
rapture … he enters upon and abides in the third jhana … With the
abandoning of pleasure and pain … he enters upon and abides in the
fourth jhana … On the dissolution of the body, after death, he
reappears in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world. This is
called the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens
in the future as pleasure. These, bhikkhus, are the four ways of
undertaking things.”</P>

is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

46. Mahadhammasamadana Sutta - The Greater Discourse on Ways of
Undertaking Things</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, for the most part beings have this wish, desire, and
longing: ‘If only unwished for, undesired, disagreeable things
would diminish and wished for, desired, agreeable things would
increase!’ Yet although beings have this wish, desire, and longing,
unwished for, undesired, disagreeable things increase for them and
wished for, desired, agreeable things diminish. Now, bhikkhus, what
do you think is the reason for that?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, [310] guided by the
Blessed One, have the Blessed One as their resort. It would be good
if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these words. Having
heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
“Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for
noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who
has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in
their Dhamma, does not know what things should be cultivated and what
things should not be cultivated, he does not know what things should
be followed and what things should not be followed. Not knowing this,
he cultivates things that should not be cultivated and does not
cultivate things that should be cultivated, he follows things that
should not be followed and does not follow things that should be
followed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote481anc" HREF="#sdendnote481sym"><SUP>cdlxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
It is because he does this that unwished for, undesired, disagreeable
things increase for him and wished for, desired, agreeable things
diminish. Why is that? That is what happens to one who does not see.</P>
<P  >4.
“The well-taught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and
is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for true
men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, knows what things
should be cultivated and what things should not be cultivated, he
knows what things should be followed and what things should not be
followed. Knowing this, he cultivates things that should be
cultivated and does not cultivate things that should not be
cultivated, he follows things that should be followed and does not
follow things that should not be followed. It is because he does this
that unwished for, undesired, disagreeable things diminish for him
and wished for, desired, agreeable things increase. Why is that? That
is what happens to one who sees.</P>
<P  >5.
“Bhikkhus, there are four ways of undertaking things. What are the
four? There is a way of undertaking things that is painful now and
ripens in the future as pain. There is [311] a way of undertaking
things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pain. There

<H3 >(THE FOUR WAYS)</H3>
<P  >14.
(1) “What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
painful now and ripens in the future as pain? Here, bhikkhus, someone
in pain and grief kills living beings, and he experiences pain and
grief that have killing of living beings as condition. In pain and
grief he takes what is not given … misconducts himself in sensual
pleasures … speaks falsehood … speaks maliciously … speaks
harshly … gossips … is covetous … has a mind of ill will …
holds wrong view, and he experiences pain and grief that have wrong

that is painful now and ripens in the future as pain.</P>

(2) “What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
pleasant now and ripens in the future as pain? Here, bhikkhus,
someone in pleasure and joy kills living beings, and he experiences
pleasure and joy that have killing of living beings as condition. In
pleasure and joy he takes what is not given … [314] … holds wrong
view, and he experiences pleasure and joy that have wrong view as

(3) “What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
painful now and ripens in the future as pleasure? Here, bhikkhus,
someone in pain and grief abstains from killing living beings, and he
experiences pain and grief that have abstention from killing living

(1) “Bhikkhus, suppose there were a bitter gourd mixed with poison,
and a man came who wanted to live, not to die, who wanted pleasure
and recoiled from pain, and they told him: ‘Good man, this bitter
gourd is mixed with poison. Drink from it if you want; [316] as you
drink from it, its colour, smell, and taste will not agree with you,
and after drinking from it, you will come to death or deadly
suffering.’ Then he drank from it without reflecting and did not
relinquish it. As he drank from it, its colour, smell, and taste did
not agree with him, and after drinking from it, he came to death or
deadly suffering. Similar to that, I say, is the way of undertaking
things that is painful now and ripens in the future as pain.</P>

<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is an inquirer, not knowing how to gauge
another’s mind,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote482anc" HREF="#sdendnote482sym"><SUP>cdlxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
should make an investigation of the Tathagata in order to find out
whether or not he is fully enlightened.”</P>

“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided
by the Blessed One, have the Blessed One as their resort. It would be
good if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these words.
Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely to [318] what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >4.
“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is an inquirer, not knowing how to gauge
another’s mind, should investigate the Tathagata with respect to
two kinds of states, states cognizable through the eye and through
the ear thus: ‘Are there found in the Tathagata or not any defiled
states cognizable through the eye or through the ear?’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote483anc" HREF="#sdendnote483sym"><SUP>cdlxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
When he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘No defiled states
cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the

through the eye or through the ear?’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote484anc" HREF="#sdendnote484sym"><SUP>cdlxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
When he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘No mixed states
cognizable through the eye or through the ear are found in the

<P  >6.
“When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: ‘Are
there found in the Tathagata or not cleansed states cognizable
through the eye or through the ear?’ When he investigates him, he
comes to know: ‘Cleansed states cognizable through the eye or
through the ear are found in the Tathagata.’</P>
<P  >7.
“When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: ‘Has
this venerable one attained this wholesome state over a long time or
did he attain it recently?’ When he investigates him, he comes to
know: ‘This venerable one has attained this wholesome state over a
long time; he did not attain it only recently.’</P>
<P  >8.
“When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: ‘Has
this venerable one acquired renown and attained fame, so that the
dangers [connected with renown and fame] are found in him?’ For,
bhikkhus, as long as a bhikkhu has not acquired renown and attained
fame, the dangers [connected with renown and fame] are not found in
him; but when he has acquired renown and attained fame, those dangers
are found in him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote485anc" HREF="#sdendnote485sym"><SUP>cdlxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
When he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘This venerable one has
acquired renown and attained fame, but the dangers [connected with
renown and fame] are not found in him.’</P>
<P  >9.
“When he comes to know this, [319] he investigates him further
thus: ‘Is this venerable one restrained without fear, not
restrained by fear, and does he avoid indulging in sensual pleasures
because he is without lust through the destruction of lust?’ When
he investigates him, he comes to know: ‘This venerable one is
restrained without fear, not restrained by fear, and he avoids
indulging in sensual pleasure because he is without lust through the
destruction of lust.’</P>
<P  >10.
“Now, bhikkhus, if others should ask that bhikkhu thus: ‘What are
the venerable one’s reasons and what is his evidence whereby he
says: “That venerable one is restrained without fear, not
restrained by fear, and he avoids indulging in sensual pleasures
because he is without lust through the destruction of lust”?’ -
answering rightly, that bhikkhu would answer thus: ‘Whether that
venerable one dwells in the Sangha or alone, while some there are
well-behaved and some are ill-behaved and some there teach a group,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote486anc" HREF="#sdendnote486sym"><SUP>cdlxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
while some here are seen concerned about material things and some are
unsullied by material things, still that venerable one does not
despise anyone because of that.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote487anc" HREF="#sdendnote487sym"><SUP>cdlxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
And I have heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips:
“I am restrained without fear, not restrained by fear, and I avoid
indulging in sensual pleasures because I am without lust through the
destruction of lust.’“</P>
<P  >11.
“The Tathagata, bhikkhus, should be questioned further about that
thus: ‘Are there found in the Tathagata or not any defiled states
cognizable through the eye or through the ear?’ The Tathagata would
answer thus: ‘No defiled states cognizable through the eye or
through the ear are found in the Tathagata.’</P>
<P  >12.
“If asked, ‘Are there found in the Tathagata or not any mixed
states cognizable through the eye or through the ear?’ the
Tathagata would answer thus: ‘No mixed states cognizable through
the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata.’</P>
<P  >13.
“If asked, ‘Are there found in the Tathagata or not cleansed
states cognizable through the eye or through the ear?’ the
Tathagata would answer thus: ‘Cleansed states cognizable through
the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathagata. They are my
pathway and my domain, yet I do not identify with them.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote488anc" HREF="#sdendnote488sym"><SUP>cdlxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
“Bhikkhus, a disciple should approach the Teacher who speaks thus
in order to hear the Dhamma. The Teacher teaches him the Dhamma with
its higher and higher levels, with its more and more sublime levels,
with its dark and bright counterparts. As the Teacher teaches the
Dhamma to a bhikkhu in this way, through direct knowledge of a
certain teaching here in that Dhamma, [320] the bhikkhu comes to a
conclusion about the teachings.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote489anc" HREF="#sdendnote489sym"><SUP>cdlxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
He places confidence in the Teacher thus: ‘The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >15.
“Now if others should ask that bhikkhu thus: ‘What are the
venerable one’s reasons and what is his evidence whereby he says,
“The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well
proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha is practising the good
way”?’ - answering rightly, that bhikkhu would answer thus:
‘Here, friends, I approached the Blessed One in order to hear the
Dhamma. The Blessed One taught me the Dhamma with its higher and
higher levels, with its more and more sublime levels, with its dark
and bright counterparts. As the Blessed One taught the Dhamma to me
in this way, through direct knowledge of a certain teaching here in
that Dhamma, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I placed
confidence in the Teacher thus: “The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha is practising the good way.’“</P>
<P  >16.
“Bhikkhus, when anyone’s faith has been planted, rooted, and
established in the Tathagata through these reasons, terms, and
phrases, his faith is said to be supported by reasons, rooted in
vision, firm;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote490anc" HREF="#sdendnote490sym"><SUP>cdxc</SUP></A></SUP>
it is invincible by any recluse or brahmin or god or Mara or Brahma
or by anyone in the world. That is how, bhikkhus, there is an
investigation of the Tathagata in accordance with the Dhamma, and
that is how the Tathagata is well investigated in accordance with the
Dhamma.”</P>

Now on that occasion the bhikkhus at Kosambi had taken to quarrelling
and brawling and were deep in disputes, stabbing each other with
verbal daggers. They could neither convince each other nor be
convinced by others; they could neither persuade each other nor be
persuaded by others.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote491anc" HREF="#sdendnote491sym"><SUP>cdxci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then [321] a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and informed him of
what was happening.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: “Come,
bhikkhu, tell those bhikkhus in my name that the Teacher calls them.”
- “Yes, venerable sir,” he replied, and he went to those bhikkhus
and told them: “The Teacher calls the venerable ones.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
friend,” they replied, and they went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, they sat down at one side. The Blessed One then
asked them: “Bhikkhus, is it true that you have taken to
quarrelling and brawling and are deep in disputes, stabbing each
other with verbal daggers; that you can neither convince each other
nor be convinced by others, that you can neither persuade each other
nor be persuaded by others?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >5.
“Bhikkhus, what do you think? When you take to quarrelling and
brawling and are deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal
daggers, do you on that occasion maintain acts of loving-kindness by
body, speech, and mind in public and in private towards your
companions in the holy life?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“So,
bhikkhus, when you take to quarrelling and brawling and are deep in
disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers, on that occasion
you do not maintain acts of loving-kindness by body, speech, and mind
in public and in private towards your companions in the holy life.
Misguided men, what can you possibly know, what can you see, that you
take to quarrelling and brawling and are deep in disputes, [322]
stabbing each other with verbal daggers? That you can neither
convince each other nor be convinced by others, that you can neither
persuade each other nor be persuaded by others? Misguided men, that
will lead to your harm and suffering for a long time.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, there
are these six memorable qualities that create love and respect and
conduce to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.
What are the six?</P>
<P  >“Here
a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of loving-kindness both in public and
in private towards his companions in the holy life. This is a
memorable quality that creates love and respect, and conduces to
helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.</P>
<P  >“Again,
a bhikkhu maintains verbal acts of loving-kindness both in public and
in private towards his companions in the holy life. This is a
memorable quality that creates love and respect, and conduces to …
unity.</P>
<P  >“Again,
a bhikkhu maintains mental acts of loving-kindness both in public and
in private towards his companions in the holy life. This is a
memorable quality that creates love and respect, and conduces to …
unity.</P>
<P  >“Again,
a bhikkhu uses things in common with his virtuous companions in the
holy life; without making reservations, he shares with them any gain
of a kind that accords with the Dhamma and has been obtained in a way
that accords with the Dhamma, including even the contents of his
bowl. This is a memorable quality that creates love and respect, and
conduces to … unity.</P>
<P  >“Again,
a bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private possessing in common
with his companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken,
untorn, unblotched, unmottled, liberating, commended by the wise, not
misapprehended, and conducive to concentration. This too is a
memorable quality that creates love and respect, and conduces to …
unity.</P>
<P  >“Again,
a bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private possessing in common
with his companions in the holy life that view that is noble and
emancipating, and leads one who practises in accordance with it to
the complete destruction of suffering.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote492anc" HREF="#sdendnote492sym"><SUP>cdxcii</SUP></A></SUP>
This too is a memorable quality that creates love and respect, and
conduces to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.</P>
<P  >“These
are the six memorable qualities that create love and respect, and
conduce to helpfulness, to non-dispute, to concord, and to unity.</P>
<P  >7.
“Of these memorable qualities, the highest, the most comprehensive,
the most conclusive is this view that is noble and emancipating, and
leads the one who practises in accordance with it to the complete
destruction of suffering. Just as the highest, the most
comprehensive, the most conclusive part of a pinnacled building is
the pinnacle itself, so too, [323] of these six memorable qualities,
the highest … is this view that is noble and emancipating …</P>
<P  >8.
“And how does this view that is noble and emancipating lead the one
who practises in accordance with it to the complete destruction of
suffering?</P>
<P  >“Here
a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty
hut, considers thus: ‘Is there any obsession unabandoned in myself
that might so obsess my mind that I cannot know or see things as they
actually are?’ If a bhikkhu is obsessed by sensual lust, then his
mind is obsessed. If he is obsessed by ill will, then his mind is
obsessed. If he is obsessed by sloth and torpor, then his mind is
obsessed. If he is obsessed by restlessness and remorse, then his
mind is obsessed. If he is obsessed by doubt, then his mind is
obsessed. If a bhikkhu is absorbed in speculation about this world,
then his mind is obsessed. If a bhikkhu is absorbed in speculation
about the other world, then his mind is obsessed. If a bhikkhu takes
to quarrelling and brawling and is deep in disputes, stabbing others
with verbal daggers, then his mind is obsessed.</P>

<H2 NAME="Heading50"  >
49. Brahmanimantanika Sutta - The Invitation of a Brahma</H2>
<P  >[326]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatth-1 in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, on one occasion I was living at Ukkattha in the Subhaga
Grove at the root of a royal sala tree.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote499anc" HREF="#sdendnote499sym"><SUP>cdxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
Now on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in Baka the Brahma
thus: ‘This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal,
this is total, this is not subject to pass away; for this neither is
born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor reappears, and beyond this
there is no escape.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote500anc" HREF="#sdendnote500sym"><SUP>d</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
“1 knew with my mind the thought in the mind of Baka the Brahma, so
just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex
his extended arm, I vanished from the root of the royal sala tree in
the Subhaga Grove at Ukkattha and appeared in that Brahma-world. Baka
the Brahma saw me coming in the distance and said: ‘Come, good sir!
Welcome, good sir! It is long, good sir, since you found an
opportunity to come here. Now, good sir, this is permanent, this is
everlasting, this is eternal, this is total, this is not subject to
pass away; for this neither is born nor ages nor dies nor passes away
nor reappears, and beyond this there is no escape.’</P>
<P  >4.
“When this was said, I told Baka the Brahma: ‘The worthy Baka the
Brahma has lapsed into ignorance; he has lapsed into ignorance in
that he says of the impermanent that it is permanent, of the
transient that it is everlasting, of the non-eternal that it is
eternal, of the incomplete that it is total, of what is subject to
pass away that it is not subject to pass away, of what is born, ages,
dies, passes away, and reappears, that it neither is born nor ages
nor dies nor passes away nor reappears; and when there is an escape
beyond this, he says that there is no escape beyond this.’</P>
<P  >5.
“Then Mara the Evil One took possession of a member of the Brahma’s
Assembly,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote501anc" HREF="#sdendnote501sym"><SUP>di</SUP></A></SUP>
and he told me: ‘Bhikkhu, bhikkhu, do not disbelieve him, do not
disbelieve him; for this Brahma is the Great Brahma, [327] the
Overlord, the Untranscended, of Infallible Vision, Wielder of
Mastery, Lord Maker and Creator, Most High Providence, Master and
Father of those that are and ever can be. Before your time, bhikkhu,
there were recluses and brahmins in the world who condemned earth
through disgust with earth,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote502anc" HREF="#sdendnote502sym"><SUP>dii</SUP></A></SUP>
who condemned water through disgust with water, who condemned fire
through disgust with fire, who condemned air through disgust with
air, who condemned beings through disgust with beings, who condemned
gods through disgust with gods, who condemned Pajapati through
disgust with Pajapati, who condemned Brahma through disgust with
Brahma; and on the dissolution of the body, when their life was cut
off, they became established in an inferior body.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote503anc" HREF="#sdendnote503sym"><SUP>diii</SUP></A></SUP>
Before your time, bhikkhu, there were also recluses and brahmins in
the world who lauded earth through delight in earth’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote504anc" HREF="#sdendnote504sym"><SUP>div</SUP></A></SUP>
who lauded water through delight in water, who lauded fire through
delight in fire, who lauded air through delight in air, who lauded
beings through delight in beings, who lauded gods through delight in
gods, who lauded Pajapati through delight in Pajapati, who lauded
Brahma through delight in Brahma; and on the dissolution of the body,
when their life was cut off, they became established in a superior
body.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote505anc" HREF="#sdendnote505sym"><SUP>dv</SUP></A></SUP>
So, bhikkhu, I tell you this: Be sure, good sir, to do only as the
Brahma says; never overstep the word of the Brahma. If you overstep
the word of the Brahma, bhikkhu, then, like a man trying to deflect
an approaching beam of light with a stick, or like a man losing his
hold on the earth with his hands and feet as he slips into a deep
chasm, so it will befall you, bhikkhu. Be sure, good sir, to do only
as the Brahma says; never overstep the word of the Brahma. Do you not
see the Brahma’s Assembly seated here, bhikkhu?’ And Mara the
Evil One thus called to witness the Brahma’s Assembly.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote506anc" HREF="#sdendnote506sym"><SUP>dvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“When this was said, I told Mara the Evil One: ‘I know you, Evil
One. Do not think: “He does not know me.” You are Mara, Evil One,
and the Brahma and the Brahma’s Assembly and the members of the
Brahma’s Assembly have all fallen into your hands, they have all
fallen into your power. You, Evil One, think: “This one too has
fallen into my hands, he too has fallen into my power”; but I have
not fallen into your hands, Evil One, I have not fallen into your
power.’</P>
<P  >7.
“When this was said, Baka the Brahma told me: ‘Good sir, I say of
the permanent that it is permanent, [328] of the everlasting that it
is everlasting, of the eternal that it is eternal, of the total that
it is total, of what is not subject to pass away that it is not
subject to pass away, of what neither is born nor ages nor dies nor
passes away nor reappears that it neither is born nor ages nor dies
nor passes away nor reappears; and when there is no escape beyond
this, I say that there is no escape beyond this. Before your time,
bhikkhu, there were recluses and brahmins in the world whose
asceticism lasted as long as your whole life. They knew, when there
is an escape beyond, that there is an escape beyond, and when there
is no escape beyond, that there is no escape beyond. So, bhikkhu, I
tell you this: You will find no escape beyond, and eventually you
will reap only weariness and disappointment. If you will hold to
earth, you will be close to me, within my domain, for me to work my
will upon and punish.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote507anc" HREF="#sdendnote507sym"><SUP>dvii</SUP></A></SUP>
If you hold to water … to fire … to air … to beings … to gods

<P  >8.
“‘I know that too, Brahma. If I will hold to earth, I shall be
close to you, within your domain, for you to work your will upon and
punish. If I will hold to water … to fire … to air … to beings
… to gods … to Pajapati … to Brahma, I shall be close to you,
within your domain, for you to work your will upon and punish.
Further, I understand your reach and your sway to extend thus: Baka
the Brahma has this much power, this much might, this much
influence.’</P>
<P  >“‘Now,
good sir, how far do you understand my reach and my sway to extend?’</P>
<P  >9.

<P  >28.
“At that the Brahma and the Brahma’s Assembly and the members of
the Brahma’s Assembly were struck with wonder and amazement,
saying: ‘It is wonderful, sirs, it is marvellous, the great power
and great might of the recluse Gotama! We have never before seen or
heard of any other recluse or brahmin who had such great power and
such great might as has this recluse Gotama, who went forth from a
Sakyan clan. Sirs, though living in a generation that delights in
being, that takes delight in being, that rejoices in being, he has
extirpated being together with its root.’</P>
<P  >29.
“Then Mara the Evil One took possession of a member of the Brahma’s
Assembly, and he said to me: ‘Good sir, if that is what you know,
if that is what you have discovered, do not guide your [lay]
disciples or those gone forth, do not teach the Dhamma to your [lay]
disciples or to those gone forth, create no yearning in your [lay]
disciples or in those gone forth. Before your time, bhikkhu, there
were recluses and brahmins in the world claiming to be accomplished
and fully enlightened, and they guided their [lay] disciples and
those gone forth; they taught the Dhamma to their [lay] disciples and
to those gone forth; they created yearning in their [lay] disciples
and in those gone forth; and on the dissolution of the body, when
their life was cut off, they became established in an inferior body.
Before your time, bhikkhu, there were also recluses and brahmins in
the world claiming to be accomplished and fully enlightened,</P>
<P  >[331]
and they did not guide their [lay] disciples or those gone forth;
they did not teach the Dhamma to their [lay] disciples or to those
gone forth; they created no yearning in their [lay] disciples or in
those gone forth; and on the dissolution of the body, when their life
was cut off, they became established in a superior body. So, bhikkhu,
I tell you this: Be sure, good sir, to abide inactive, devoted to a
pleasant abiding here and now; this is better left undeclared, and
so, good sir, inform no one else.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote515anc" HREF="#sdendnote515sym"><SUP>dxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >30.
“When this was said, I told Mara the Evil One: ‘I know you, Evil
One. Do not think: “He does not know me.” You are Mara, Evil One.
It is not out of compassion for their welfare that you speak thus, it
is without compassion for their welfare that you speak thus. You
think thus, Evil One: “Those to whom the recluse Gotama teaches the
Dhamma will escape from my sphere.” Those recluses and brahmins of
yours, Evil One, who claimed to be accomplished and fully
enlightened, were not accomplished and fully enlightened. But I, who
claim to be accomplished and fully enlightened, am accomplished and
fully enlightened. If the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma to disciples
he is such, Evil One, and if the Tathagata does not teach the Dhamma
to disciples he is such.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote516anc" HREF="#sdendnote516sym"><SUP>dxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
If the Tathagata guides disciples he is such, Evil One, and if the
Tathagata does not guide disciples he is such. Why is that? Because
the Tathagata has abandoned the taints that defile, bring renewal of
being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth,
ageing, and death; he has cut them off at the root, made them like a
palm stump, done away with them so that they are no longer subject to
future arising. Just as a palm tree whose crown is cut off is
incapable of further growth, so too, the Tathagata has abandoned the
taints that defile … cut them off at the root, made them like a
palm stump, done away with them so that they are no longer subject to
future arising.’“</P>

50. Maratajjaniya Sutta - The Rebuke to Mara</H2>

was living in the Bhagga country at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala
Grove, the Deer Park.</P>

Now on that occasion the venerable Maha Moggallana was walking up and
down in the open. And on that occasion Mara the Evil One went into
the venerable Maha Moggallana’s belly and entered his bowels. Then
the venerable Maha Moggallana considered thus: “Why is my belly so
heavy? One would think it full of beans.” Thus he left the walk and
went into his dwelling, where he sat down on a seat made ready.</P>
<P  >3.
When he had sat down, he gave thorough attention to himself, and he
saw that Mara the Evil One had gone into his belly and had entered
his bowels. When he saw this, he said: “Come out, Evil One! Come
out, Evil One! Do not harass the Tathagata, do not harass the
Tathagata’s disciple, or it will lead to your harm and suffering
for a long time.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then Mara the Evil One thought: “This recluse does not know me, he
does not see me when he says that. Even his teacher would not know me
so soon, so how can this disciple know me?”</P>
<P  >5.
Then the venerable Maha Moggallana said: “Even thus I know you,
Evil One. Do not think: ‘He does not know me.’ You are Mara, Evil
One. You were thinking thus, Evil One: ‘This recluse does not know
me, he does not see me when he says that. Even his teacher would not
know me so soon, so how can this disciple know me?’“</P>
<P  >6.
Then Mara the Evil One thought: “The recluse knew me, he saw me
when he said that,” whereupon he [333] came up from the venerable
Maha Moggallana’s mouth and stood against the door bar.</P>
<P  >7.
The venerable Maha Moggallana saw him standing there and said: “I
see you there too, Evil One. Do not think: ‘He does not see me.’
You are standing against the door bar, Evil One.</P>
<P  >8.
“It happened once, Evil One, that I was a Mara named Dusi,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote517anc" HREF="#sdendnote517sym"><SUP>dxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
and I had a sister named Kali. You were her son, so you were my
nephew.</P>
<P  >9.
“Now on that occasion the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and
fully enlightened, had appeared in the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote518anc" HREF="#sdendnote518sym"><SUP>dxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
The Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, had
an auspicious pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sanjiva.
Among all the disciples of the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished
and fully enlightened, there was none equal to the venerable Vidhura
in teaching the Dhamma. That was how the venerable Vidhura came to
have the designation ‘Vidhura.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote519anc" HREF="#sdendnote519sym"><SUP>dxix</SUP></A></SUP>
But the venerable Sanjiva, gone to the forest or to the root of a
tree or to an empty hut, entered without difficulty upon the
cessation of perception and feeling.</P>
<P  >10.
“It happened once, Evil One, that the venerable Sanjiva had seated
himself at the root of a certain tree and entered upon the cessation
of perception and feeling. Some cowherds, shepherds, and ploughmen
passing by saw the venerable Sanjiva sitting at the root of the tree
having entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling, and they
thought: ‘It is wonderful, sirs, it is marvellous! There is this
recluse sitting here dead. Let us cremate him.’ Then the cowherds,
shepherds, and ploughmen collected grass, wood, and cowdung, and
having piled it up against the venerable Sanjiva’s body, they set
fire to it and went on their way.</P>
<P  >11.
“Now, Evil One, when the night had ended, the venerable Sanjiva
emerged from the attainment.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote520anc" HREF="#sdendnote520sym"><SUP>dxx</SUP></A></SUP>
He shook his robe, and then, it being morning, he dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, he went into the village for alms. The
cowherds, shepherds, and ploughmen passing by saw the venerable
Sanjiva wandering for alms, and they thought: ‘It is wonderful,
sirs, it is marvellous! This recluse who was sitting there dead has
come back to life!’ [334] That was how the venerable Sanjiva came
to have the designation ‘Sanjiva.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote521anc" HREF="#sdendnote521sym"><SUP>dxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
“Then, Evil One, the Mara Dusi considered thus: ‘There are these
virtuous bhikkhus of good character, but I do not know their coming
or their going. Let me now take possession of the brahmin
householders, telling them: “Come now, abuse, revile, scold, and
harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when
they are abused, reviled, scolded, and harassed by you, some change
will come about in their minds whereby the Mara Dusi may find an
opportunity.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote522anc" HREF="#sdendnote522sym"><SUP>dxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

brahmin householders, they abused, reviled, scolded, and harassed the
virtuous bhikkhus of good character thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote523anc" HREF="#sdendnote523sym"><SUP>dxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>

drooping, heads down and all limp, they meditate, premeditate,
outmeditate, and mismeditate.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote525anc" HREF="#sdendnote525sym"><SUP>dxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as an owl on a branch waiting for a mouse meditates,
premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates, or just as a jackal on
a river-bank waiting for fish meditates, premeditates, out-meditates,
and mismeditates, or just as a cat by a door-post or a dust-bin or a
drain, waiting for a mouse, meditates, premeditates, out-meditates,
and mismeditates, or just as a donkey unladen, standing by a
door-post or a dust-bin or a drain, meditates, premeditates,
out-meditates, and mismeditates, so too, these bald-pated recluses,
these swarthy menial offspring of the Kinsman’s feet, claim: “We
are meditators, we are meditators!” and with shoulders drooping,
heads down and all limp, they meditate, premeditate, out-meditate,
and mismeditate.’ Now, Evil One, on that occasion most of those
human beings, when they died, reappeared on the dissolution of the
body, after death, in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy
destination, in perdition, even in hell. [335]</P>
<P  >14.
“Then the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully
enlightened, addressed the bhikkhus thus: ‘Bhikkhus, the Mara Dusi
has taken possession of the brahmin householders, telling them: “Come
now, abuse, revile, scold, and harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good
character; then perhaps, when they are abused, reviled, scolded, and
harassed by you, some change will come about in their mind whereby
the Mara Dusi may find an opportunity.” Come, bhikkhus, abide
pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness,
likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so
above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to yourselves,
abide pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility
and without ill will. Abide pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with compassion … with a mind imbued with appreciative joy … with
a mind imbued with equanimity … abundant, exalted, immeasurable,
without hostility and without ill will.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote526anc" HREF="#sdendnote526sym"><SUP>dxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
“So, Evil One, when those bhikkhus had been thus advised and
instructed by the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully
enlightened, then, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to
an empty hut, they abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with loving-kindness … with a mind imbued with compassion … with

“Then, Evil One, the Mara Dusi considered thus: ‘Though I do as I

“Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One Kakusandha,
accomplished and fully enlightened, dressed, and taking his bowl and
outer robe, he went into the village for alms with the venerable
Vidhura as his attendant.</P>
<P  >21.
“Then the Mara Dusi took possession of a certain boy, and picking
up a stone, he struck the venerable Vidhura on the head with it and
cut his head. With blood running from his cut head, [337] the
venerable Vidhura followed close behind the Blessed One Kakusandha,
accomplished and fully enlightened. Then the Blessed One Kakusandha,
accomplished and fully enlightened, turned around and looked at him
with the elephant look: ‘This Mara Dusi- knows no bounds.’ And
with that look, Evil One, the Mara Dusi fell from that place and
reappeared in the Great Hell.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote529anc" HREF="#sdendnote529sym"><SUP>dxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Now, Evil One, there are three names for the Great Hell: the hell

and the hell to be felt for oneself.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote530anc" HREF="#sdendnote530sym"><SUP>dxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
Then, Evil One, the wardens of hell came up to me and said: ‘Good

have been roasting in hell for a thousand years.’“</P>
<P  >23.
“For many a year, Evil One, for many a century, for many a

51. Kandaraka Sutta - To Kandaraka</H2>
<P  >[339]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Campa on the banks of the Gaggara Lake with a large Sangha of
bhikkhus. Then Pessa, the elephant driver’s son, and Kandaraka the
wanderer went to the Blessed One. Pessa, after paying homage to the
Blessed One, sat down at one side, while Kandaraka exchanged
greetings with the Blessed One, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he stood at one side.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote538anc" HREF="#sdendnote538sym"><SUP>dxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Standing there, he surveyed the Sangha of bhikkhus sitting in
complete silence,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote539anc" HREF="#sdendnote539sym"><SUP>dxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
and then he said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >2.
“It is wonderful, Master Gotama, it is marvellous how the Sangha of
bhikkhus has been led to practise the right way by Master Gotama.
Those who were Blessed Ones, accomplished and fully enlightened in
the past, at most only led the Sangha of bhikkhus to practise the
right way as is done by Master Gotama now. And those who will be
Blessed Ones, accomplished and fully enlightened in the future, at
most will only lead the Sangha of bhikkhus to practise the right way
as is done by Master Gotama now.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote540anc" HREF="#sdendnote540sym"><SUP>dxl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
“So it is, Kandaraka, so it is! Those who were Blessed Ones,
accomplished and fully enlightened in the past, at most only led the
Sangha of bhikkhus to practise the right way as is done by me now.
And those who will be Blessed Ones, accomplished and fully
enlightened in the future, at most will only lead the Sangha of
bhikkhus to practise the right way as is done by me now.</P>
<P  >“Kandaraka,
in this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who are arahants with
taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be
done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the
fetters of being, and who are completely liberated through final
knowledge. In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus in higher
training, of constant virtue, living a life of constant virtue,
sagacious, living a life of constant sagacity. They abide with their
minds well established in the four foundations of mindfulness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote541anc" HREF="#sdendnote541sym"><SUP>dxli</SUP></A></SUP>
What four? Here, Kandaraka, [340] a bhikkhu abides contemplating the
body as a body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating
feelings as feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put
away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating
mind as mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating
mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful,
having put away covetousness and grief for the world.”</P>
<P  >4.
When this was said, Pessa, the elephant driver’s son, said: “It
is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous how well the four
foundations of mindfulness have been made known by the Blessed One:
for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and
lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the
attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbana. From time
to time, venerable sir, we white-clothed lay people also abide with
our minds well established in these four foundations of mindfulness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote542anc" HREF="#sdendnote542sym"><SUP>dxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, venerable sir, we abide contemplating the body as a body …
feelings as feelings … mind as mind … mind-objects as
mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world. It is wonderful, venerable sir,
it is marvellous how amid man’s tangle, corruption, and deceptions,
the Blessed One knows the welfare and harm of beings. For humankind
is a tangle but the animal is open enough. Venerable sir, I can drive
an elephant to be tamed, and in the time it takes to make a trip back
and forth in Campa, that elephant will show every kind of deception,
duplicity, crookedness, and fraud [he is capable of].<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote543anc" HREF="#sdendnote543sym"><SUP>dxliii</SUP></A></SUP>
But those who are called our slaves, messengers, and servants behave
in one way with the body, in another way by speech, while their minds
work in still another way. It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is
marvellous how amid man’s tangle, corruption, and deceptions, the
Blessed One knows the welfare and harm of beings. For humankind is a
tangle but the animal is open enough.”</P>
<P  >5.
“So it is, Pessa, so it is! [341] Humankind is a tangle but the
animal is open enough. Pessa, there are four kinds of persons to be
found existing in the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote544anc" HREF="#sdendnote544sym"><SUP>dxliv</SUP></A></SUP>
What four? Here a certain kind of person torments himself and pursues
the practice of torturing himself. Here a certain kind of person
torments others and pursues the practice of torturing others. Here a
certain kind of person torments himself and pursues the practice of
torturing himself, and he also torments others and pursues the
practice of torturing others. Here a certain kind of person does not
torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself, and he
does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others.
Since he torments neither himself nor others, he is here and now
hungerless, extinguished, and cooled, and he abides experiencing
bliss, having himself become holy.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote545anc" HREF="#sdendnote545sym"><SUP>dxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
Which of these four kinds of persons satisfies your mind, Pessa?”</P>
<P  >“The
first three do not satisfy my mind, venerable sir, but the last one
satisfies my mind.”</P>
<P  >6.
“But, Pessa, why don’t the first three kinds of persons satisfy
your mind?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, the kind of person who torments himself and pursues the practice
of torturing himself, torments and tortures himself though he desires
pleasure and recoils from pain; that is why this kind of person does
not satisfy my mind. And the kind of person who torments others and
pursues the practice of torturing others, torments and tortures
others who desire pleasure and recoil from pain; that is why this
kind of person does not satisfy my mind. And the kind of person who
torments himself and pursues the practice of torturing himself, and
who also torments others and pursues the practice of torturing
others, torments and tortures himself and others, both of whom desire
pleasure and recoil from pain; that is why this kind of person does
not satisfy my mind. [342] But the kind of person who does not
torment himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who
does not torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others;
who, since he torments neither himself nor others, is here and now
hungerless, extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing bliss,
having himself become holy - he does not torment and torture either
himself or others, both of whom desire pleasure and recoil from pain.
That is why this kind of person satisfies my mind. And now, venerable
sir, we depart. We are busy and have much to do.”</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time, Pessa, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >Then
Pessa, the elephant driver’s son, having delighted and rejoiced in
the Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.</P>
<P  >7.
Soon after he had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:
“Bhikkhus, Pessa, the elephant driver’s son, is wise, he has
great wisdom. If he had sat a while longer until I had expounded for
him in detail these four kinds of persons, he would have greatly
benefited. Still he has already greatly benefited even as it is.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote546anc" HREF="#sdendnote546sym"><SUP>dxlvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“This
is the time, Blessed One, this is the time, Sublime One, for the
Blessed One to expound in detail these four kinds of persons. Having
heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
bhikkhus, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” “Yes,
venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >8.
“Bhikkhus, what kind of person torments himself and pursues the
practice of torturing himself?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote547anc" HREF="#sdendnote547sym"><SUP>dxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here a certain person goes naked, rejecting conventions, licking his
hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when asked; he does not
accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a
meal; he receives nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across a
threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating together,
from a pregnant woman, from a woman giving suck, from a woman lying
with a man, from where food is advertised to be distributed, from
where a dog is waiting, from where flies are buzzing; he accepts no
fish or meat, he drinks no liquor, wine, or fermented brew. He keeps
to one house, to one morsel; he keeps to two houses to two morsels; …
he keeps to seven houses, to seven morsels. He lives on one saucerful
a day, on two saucerfuls a day … on seven saucerfuls a day. He
takes food once a day, [343] once every two days … once every seven
days, and so on up to once every fortnight; he dwells pursuing the
practice of taking food at stated intervals. He is an eater of greens
or millet or wild rice or hide-parings or moss or ricebran or
rice-scum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung. He lives on forest
roots and fruits, he feeds on fallen fruits. He clothes himself in
hemp, in hemp mixed cloth, in shrouds, in refuse rags, in tree bark,
in antelope hide, in strips of antelope hide, in kusa-grass fabric,
in bark fabric, in wood-shavings fabric, in head-hair wool, in animal
wool, in owls’ wings. He is one who pulls out hair and beard,
pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard. He is one who
stands continuously, rejecting seats. He is one who squats
continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting position. He is
one who uses a mattress of spikes; he makes a mattress of spikes his
bed. He dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times
daily including the evening. Thus in such a variety of ways he dwells
pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body. This is
called the kind of person who torments himself and pursues the
practice of torturing himself.</P>
<P  >9.
“What kind of person, bhikkhus, torments others and pursues the
practice of torturing others? Here a certain person is a butcher of
sheep, a butcher of pigs, a fowler, a trapper of wild beasts, a
hunter, a fisherman, a thief, an executioner, a prison warden, or one
who follows any other such bloody occupation. This is called the kind
of person who torments others and pursues the practice of torturing
others.</P>
<P  >10.
“What kind of person, bhikkhus, torments himself and pursues the
practice of torturing himself and also torments others and pursues
the practice of torturing others? Here some person is a head-anointed
noble king or a well-to-do Brahmin.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote548anc" HREF="#sdendnote548sym"><SUP>dxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Having had a new sacrificial temple built to the east of the city,
and having shaved off his hair and beard, dressed himself in rough
hide, and greased his body with ghee and oil, scratching his back
with a deer’s horn, he enters the sacrificial temple together with
his chief queen and his brahmin high priest. There he lies down on
the bare ground with the grass on it. The king lives on the milk in
the first teat of a cow with a calf of the same colour [344] while
the chief queen lives on the milk in the second teat and the brahmin
high priest lives on the milk in the third teat; the milk in the
fourth teat they pour onto the fire, and the calf lives on what is
left. He says thus: ‘Let so many bulls be slaughtered for
sacrifice, let so many bullocks be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so
many heifers be slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many goats be
slaughtered for sacrifice, let so many sheep be slaughtered for
sacrifice, let so many trees be felled for the sacrificial posts, let
so much grass be cut for the sacrificial grass.’ And then his
slaves, messengers, and servants make preparations, weeping with
tearful faces, being spurred on by threats of punishment and by fear.
This is called the kind of person who torments himself and pursues
the practice of torturing himself and who torments others and pursues
the practice of torturing others.</P>
<P  >11.
“What kind of person, bhikkhus, does not torment himself or pursue
the practice of torturing himself and does not torment others or
pursue the practice of tormenting others - the one who, since he
torments neither himself nor others, is here and now hungerless,
extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing bliss, having
himself become holy?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote549anc" HREF="#sdendnote549sym"><SUP>dxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Here, bhikkhus, a Tathagata appears in the world, accomplished,
fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime,
knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher
of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with
its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this generation with its
recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, which he has
himself realised by direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma good in
the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the
right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is
utterly perfect and pure.</P>
<P  >13.
“A householder or householder’s son or one born in some other
clan hears that Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in
the Tathagata. Possessing that faith, he considers thus: ‘Household
life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not
easy, while living in a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect
and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard,
put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into
homelessness.’ On a later occasion, abandoning a small or a large
fortune, [345] abandoning a small or a large circle of relatives, he
shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the yellow robe, and goes
forth from the home life into homelessness.</P>
<P  >14.
“Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus’ training and
way of life, abandoning the killing of living beings, he abstains
from killing living beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gentle
and kindly, he abides compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning
the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not
given; taking only what is given, expecting only what is given, by
not stealing he abides in purity. Abandoning incelibacy, he observes
celibacy, living apart, abstaining from the vulgar practice of sexual
intercourse.</P>
<P  >“Abandoning
false speech, he abstains from false speech; he speaks truth, adheres
to truth, is trustworthy and reliable, one who is no deceiver of the
world. Abandoning malicious speech, he abstains from malicious
speech; he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order
to divide [those people] from these, nor does he repeat to these
people what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people]
from those; thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a
promoter of friendships, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord,
delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote concord.
Abandoning harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks
such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to
the heart, are courteous, desired by many and agreeable to many.
Abandoning gossip, he abstains from gossip; he speaks at the right
time, speaks what is fact, speaks on what is good, speaks on the
Dhamma and the Discipline; at the right time he speaks such words as
are worth recording, reasonable, moderate, and beneficial.</P>
<P  >“He
abstains from injuring seeds and plants. He practises eating only in
one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and outside the
proper time. He abstains from dancing, singing, music, and theatrical
shows. He abstains from wearing garlands, smartening himself with
scent, and embellishing himself with unguents. He abstains from high
and large couches. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He
abstains from accepting raw grain. He abstains from accepting raw
meat. He abstains from accepting women and girls. He abstains from
accepting men and women slaves. He abstains from accepting goats and
sheep. He abstains from accepting fowl and pigs. He abstains from
accepting elephants, cattle, horses, and mares. He abstains from
accepting fields and land. He abstains from going on errands and
running messages. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstains
from false weights, false metals, and false measures. [346] He
abstains from cheating, deceiving, defrauding, and trickery. He
abstains from wounding, murdering, binding, brigandage, plunder, and
violence.</P>

“He becomes content with robes to protect his body and with
almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out
taking only these with him. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies
with its wings as its only burden, so too, the bhikkhu becomes
content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain
his stomach, and wherever he goes he sets out taking only these with
him. Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue, he experiences within
himself a bliss that is blameless.</P>
<P  >16.
“On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at its signs and
features. Since, if he left the eye faculty unguarded, evil
unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he
practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he
undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with
the ear … On smelling an odour with the nose … On tasting a
flavour with the tongue … On touching a tangible with the body …
On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, he does not grasp at its
signs and features. Since, if he left the mind faculty unguarded,
evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade him,
he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the, mind faculty,
he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty. Possessing this
noble restraint of the faculties, he experiences within himself a
bliss that is unsullied.</P>
<P  >17.
“He becomes one who acts in full awareness when going forward and
returning; who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking
away; who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his
limbs; who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying
his outer robe and bowl; who acts in full awareness when eating,
drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts in full awareness
when defecating and urinating; who acts in full awareness when
walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and
keeping silent.</P>
<P  >18.
“Possessing this aggregate of noble virtue, and this noble
restraint of the faculties, and possessing this noble mindfulness and
full awareness, he resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest,
the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel
ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.</P>
<P  >19.
“On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down,
folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing
mindfulness before him. [347] Abandoning covetousness for the world,
he abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind
from covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a
mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living
beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning
sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of
light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and
torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated
with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness
and remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt,
unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.</P>
<P  >20.
“Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</P>
<P  >21.
“Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he
enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has selfconfidence
and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of concentration.</P>
<P  >22.
“Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, he abides in
equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with
the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on account of
which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding who has
equanimity and is mindful.’</P>
<P  >23.
“Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, he enters upon and abides in
the fourth jhana, which has neither-painnor-pleasure and purity of
mindfulness due to equanimity.</P>
<P  >24.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one
birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten
births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a
hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many
aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of worldexpansion, many aeons
of world-contraction and expansion: ‘There I was so named, of such
a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my
experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away
from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of
such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my
experience of pleasure and pain, [348] such my life-term; and passing
away from there, I reappeared here.’ Thus with their aspects and
particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >25.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing,
inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. He
understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus:
‘These worthy beings who were ill-conducted in body, speech, and
mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to
wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after
death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad
destination, in perdition, even in hell; but these worthy beings who
were wellconducted in body, speech, and mind, not revilers of noble
ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in their
actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared
in a good destination, even in the heavenly world.’ Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions.</P>
<P  >26.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. He understands as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’;
he understands as it actually is: ‘This is the origin of
suffering’; he understands as it actually is: ‘This is the
cessation of suffering’; he understands as it actually is: ‘This
is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ He understands
as it actually is: ‘These are the taints’; he understands as it
actually is: ‘This is the origin of the taints’; he understands
as it actually is: ‘This is the cessation of the taints’; he
understands as it actually is: ‘This is the way leading to the
cessation of the taints.’</P>
<P  >27.
“When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It is
liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’</P>
<P  >28.
“This, bhikkhus, is called the kind of person who does not torment
himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not
torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others [349] - the
one who, since he torments neither himself nor others, is here and
now hungerless, extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing
bliss, having himself become holy.”</P>

THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Venerable Ananda was living at
Beluvagamaka near Vesali.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara had
arrived at Pataliputta for some business or other. Then he went to a
certain bhikkhu in Kukkuta’s Park, and after paying homage to him,
he sat down at one side and asked him: “Where does the venerable
Ananda live now, venerable sir? I wish to see the venerable Ananda.”</P>
<P  >“The
venerable Ananda is living at Beluvagamaka near Vesali, householder.”</P>
<P  >3.
When the householder Dasama had completed his business at
Pataliputta, he went to the venerable Ananda at Beluvagamaka near
Vesali. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and asked
him:</P>
<P  >“Venerable

“Here, householder, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the

Then the householder Dasama of Atthakanagara assembled the Sangha of

53. Sekha Sutta - The Disciple in Higher Training</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a new assembly hall had recently been built for
the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu and it had not yet been inhabited by any
recluse or brahmin or human being at all. Then the Sakyans of
Kapilavatthu went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him,
they sat down at one side and said to him:</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, a new assembly hall has recently been built here for the Sakyans
of Kapilavatthu and it has not yet been inhabited by any recluse or
brahmin or human being at all. Venerable sir, let the Blessed One be
the first to use it. When the Blessed One has used it first, then the
Sakyans of Kapilavatthu will use it afterwards. That will lead to
their welfare and happiness for a long time.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote557anc" HREF="#sdendnote557sym"><SUP>dlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
[354]</P>
<P  >3.
The Blessed One consented in silence. Then, when they saw that he had
consented, they got up from their seats, and after paying homage to
him, keeping him on their right, they went to the assembly hall. They
covered it completely with coverings and prepared seats, and they put
out a large water jug and hung up an oil-lamp. Then they went to the
Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they stood at one side
and said:</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, the assembly hall has been covered completely with coverings and
seats have been prepared, a large water jug has been put out and an
oil-lamp hung up. Now is the time for the Blessed One to do as he
thinks fit.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he
went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the assembly hall. When he
arrived, he washed his feet and then entered the hall and sat down by
the central pillar facing the east. And the bhikkhus washed their
feet and then entered the hall and sat down by the western wall
facing the east, with the Blessed One before them. And the Sakyans of
Kapilavatthu washed their feet and entered the hall and sat down by
the eastern wall facing the west, with the Blessed One before them.</P>
<P  >5.
Then, when the Blessed One had instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu with talk on the Dhamma for
much of the night, he said to the venerable Ananda: “Ananda, speak
to the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu about the disciple in higher training
who has entered upon the way.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote558anc" HREF="#sdendnote558sym"><SUP>dlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
My back is uncomfortable. I will rest it.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” the venerable Ananda replied.</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One prepared his patchwork cloak folded in four and lay
down on his right side in the lion’s pose, with one foot
overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in his
mind the time for rising.</P>
<P  >6.
Then the venerable Ananda addressed Mahanama the Sakyan thus:</P>
<P  >“Mahanama,
here a noble disciple is possessed of virtue, guards the doors of his
sense faculties, is moderate in eating, and devoted to wakefulness;
he possesses seven good qualities; and he is one who obtains at will,
without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that constitute the
higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now. [355]</P>
<P  >7.
“And how is a noble disciple possessed of virtue? Here a noble
disciple is virtuous, he dwells restrained with the restraint of the
Patimokkha, he is perfect in conduct and resort, and seeing fear in
the slightest fault, he trains by undertaking the training precepts.
This is how a noble disciple is possessed of virtue.</P>
<P  >8.
“And how does a noble disciple guard the doors of his sense
faculties? On seeing a form with the eye, a noble disciple does not
grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the eye faculty
unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might
invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards the eye
faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a
sound with the ear … On smelling an odour with the nose … On
tasting a flavour with the tongue … On touching a tangible with the
body … on cognizing a mind-object with the mind, a noble disciple
does not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if he left the mind
faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief
might invade him, he practises the way of its restraint, he guards
the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty.
That is how a noble disciple guards the doors of his sense faculties.</P>
<P  >9.
“And how is a noble disciple moderate in eating? Here, reflecting
wisely, a noble disciple takes food neither for amusement nor for
intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness,
but only for the endurance and continuance of this body, for ending
discomfort, and for assisting the holy life, considering: ‘Thus I
shall terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I
shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort.’ That is
how a noble disciple is moderate in eating.</P>
<P  >10.
“And how is a noble disciple devoted to wakefulness? Here, during
the day, while walking back and forth and sitting, a noble disciple
purifies his mind of obstructive states. In the first watch of the
night, while walking back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind
of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night he lies down
on the right side in the lion’s pose with one foot overlapping the
other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in his mind the time for
rising. After rising, in the third watch of the night, while walking
back and forth and sitting, he purifies his mind of obstructive
states. That is how a noble disciple is devoted to wakefulness. [356]</P>
<P  >11.
“And how does a noble disciple possess seven good qualities? Here a
noble disciple has faith; he places his faith in the Tathagata’s
enlightenment thus: ‘The Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’</P>
<P  >12.
“He has shame; he is ashamed of misconduct in body, speech, and
mind, ashamed of engaging in evil unwholesome deeds.</P>
<P  >13.
“He has fear of wrongdoing; he is afraid of misconduct in body,
speech, and mind, afraid of engaging in evil unwhole some deeds.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote559anc" HREF="#sdendnote559sym"><SUP>dlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
“He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and
consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as are good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right
meaning and phrasing, and affirm a holy life that is utterly perfect
and pure - such teachings as these he has learned much of,
remembered, recited verbally, investigated with the mind and
penetrated well by view.</P>
<P  >15.
“He is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in
undertaking wholesome states; he is steadfast, firm in striving, not
remiss in developing wholesome states.</P>
<P  >16.
“He has mindfulness; he possesses the highest mindfulness and
skill; he recalls and recollects what was done long ago and spoken
long ago.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote560anc" HREF="#sdendnote560sym"><SUP>dlx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >17.
“He is wise; he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance
that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction
of suffering.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote561anc" HREF="#sdendnote561sym"><SUP>dlxi</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how a noble disciple possesses seven good qualities.</P>
<P  >18.
“And how is a noble disciple one who obtains at will, without
trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that constitute the higher
mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now? Here, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a
noble disciple enters upon and abides in the first jhana … With the
stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon and abides
in the second jhana … With the fading away as well of rapture …
he enters upon and abides in the third jhana … With the abandoning
of pleasure and pain … he enters upon and abides in the fourth
jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness
due to equanimity. That is how a noble disciple is one who obtains at
will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that constitute
the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now.</P>
<P  >19.
“When a noble disciple has thus become one who is possessed of
virtue, who guards the doors of his sense faculties, who is moderate
in eating, who is devoted to wakefulness, who possesses seven good
qualities, [357] who obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty,
the four jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a
pleasant abiding here and now, he is called one in higher training
who has entered upon the way. His eggs are unspoiled; he is capable
of breaking out, capable of enlightenment, capable of attaining the
supreme security from bondage.</P>
<P  >“Suppose
there were a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs, which she had
covered, incubated, and nurtured properly.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote562anc" HREF="#sdendnote562sym"><SUP>dlxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Even
though she did not wish: ‘Oh, that my chicks might pierce their
shells with the points of their claws and beaks and hatch out
safely!’ yet the chicks are capable of piercing their shells with
the points of their claws and beaks and hatching out safely. So too,
when a noble disciple has thus become one who is possessed of virtue
… he is called one in higher training who has entered upon the way.
His eggs are unspoiled; he is capable of breaking out, capable of
enlightenment, capable of attaining the supreme security from
bondage.</P>
<P  >20.
“Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is
due to equanimity,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote563anc" HREF="#sdendnote563sym"><SUP>dlxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
this noble disciple recollects his manifold past lives … (as Sutta
51, §24) … Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects
his manifold past lives. This is his first breaking out like that of
the hen’s chicks from their shells.</P>
<P  >21.
“Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is
due to equanimity, with the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, this noble disciple sees beings passing away and
reappearing … (as Sutta 51, §25) … he understands how beings
pass on according to their actions. This is his second breaking out
like that of the hen’s chicks from their shells.</P>
<P  >22.
“Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is
due to equanimity, by realising for himself with direct knowledge,
this noble disciple here and now enters upon and abides in the
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with
the destruction of the taints. [358] This is his third breaking out
like that of the hen’s chicks from their shells.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote564anc" HREF="#sdendnote564sym"><SUP>dlxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
“When a noble disciple is possessed of virtue, that is his conduct.
When he guards the doors of his sense faculties, that is his conduct.
When he is moderate in eating, that is his conduct. When he is
devoted to wakefulness, that is his conduct. When he possesses seven
good qualities, that is his conduct. When he is one who obtains at
will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhanas that constitute
the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now, that is
his conduct.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote565anc" HREF="#sdendnote565sym"><SUP>dlxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >24.
“When he recollects his manifold past lives … with their aspects
and particulars, that is his true knowledge. When, with the divine
eye … he sees beings passing away and reappearing and understands
how beings pass on according to their actions, that is his true
knowledge. When, by realising for himself with</P>
<P  >direct
knowledge, he here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance
of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the
destruction of the taints, that is his true knowledge.</P>
<P  >25.
“This noble disciple is thus said to be perfect in true knowledge,
perfect in conduct, perfect in true knowledge and conduct. And this
stanza was uttered by the Brahma Sanankumara:</P>
<P >
‘The noble clan is held to be</P>
<P >
The best of people as to lineage;</P>
<P >
But best of gods and humans is one</P>
<P >
Perfect in true knowledge and conduct.’</P>
<P  >“Now
that stanza was well sung by the Brahma Sanankumara, not ill-sung; it
was well spoken, not ill-spoken; it has a meaning, and is not
meaningless; and it was approved by the Blessed One.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote566anc" HREF="#sdendnote566sym"><SUP>dlxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >26.
Then the Blessed One rose and addressed the venerable Ananda thus:
“Good, good, Ananda! It is good that you have spoken to the Sakyans
of Kapilavatthu about the disciple in higher training who has entered
upon the way.” [359]</P>
<P  >That
is what the venerable Ananda said. The Teacher approved. The Sakyans
of Kapilavatthu were satisfied and delighted in the venerable
Ananda’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading55"  >
54. Potaliya Sutta - To Potaliya</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
country of the Anguttarapans at a town of theirs named Apana.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Apana for alms. When he had wandered
for alms in Apana and had returned from his almsround, after his meal
he went to a certain grove for the day’s abiding. Having entered
the grove, he sat down at the root of a tree.</P>
<P  >3.
Potaliya the householder, while walking and wandering for exercise,
wearing full dress with parasol and sandals, also went to the grove,
and having entered the grove, he went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he stood at one side. The Blessed One said to him:
“There are seats, householder, sit down if you like.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the householder Potaliya thought: “The recluse
Gotama addresses me as ‘householder,’“and angry and displeased,
he remained silent.</P>
<P  >A
second time the Blessed One said to him: “There are seats,
householder, sit down if you like.” And a second time the
householder Potaliya thought: “The recluse Gotama addresses me as
‘householder,’“and angry and displeased, he remained silent.</P>
<P  >A
third time the Blessed One said to him: “There are seats,
householder, sit down if you like.” When this was said, the
householder Potaliya thought: “The recluse Gotama addresses me as
‘householder,’“and angry and displeased, he said to the Blessed
One: [360] “Master Gotama, it is neither fitting nor proper that
you address me as ‘householder.’“</P>
<P  >“Householder,
you have the aspects, marks, and signs of a householder.”</P>
<P  >“Nevertheless,
Master Gotama, I have given up all my works and cut off all my
affairs.”</P>
<P  >“In
what way have you given up all your works, householder, and cut off
all your affairs?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Gotama, I have given all my wealth, grain, silver, and gold to my
children as their inheritance. Without advising or admonishing them,
I live merely on food and clothing. That is how I have given up all
my works and cut off all my affairs.”</P>
<P  >“Householder,
the cutting off of affairs as you describe it is one thing, but in
the Noble One’s Discipline the cutting off of affairs is
different.”</P>
<P  >“What
is the cutting off of affairs like in the Noble One’s Discipline,
venerable sir? It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One
would teach me the Dhamma, showing what the cutting off of affairs is
like in the Noble One’s Discipline.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, householder, and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” Potaliya the householder replied. The Blessed One
said this:</P>
<P  >4.
“Householder, there are these eight things in the Noble One’s
Discipline that lead to the cutting off of affairs. What are the
eight? With the support of the non-killing of living beings, the
killing of living beings is to be abandoned. With the support of
taking only what is given, the taking of what is not given is to be
abandoned. With the support of truthful speech, false speech is to be
abandoned. With the support of unmalicious speech, malicious speech
is to be abandoned. With the support of refraining from rapacious
greed’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote567anc" HREF="#sdendnote567sym"><SUP>dlxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
rapacious greed is to be abandoned. With the support of refraining
from spiteful scolding, spiteful scolding is to be abandoned. With
the support of refraining from angry despair, angry despair is to be
abandoned. With the support of non-arrogance, arrogance is to be
abandoned. These are the eight things, stated in brief without being
expounded in detail, that lead to the cutting off of affairs in the
Noble One’s Discipline.”</P>
<P  >5.
“Venerable sir, it would be good if, out of compassion, the Blessed
One would expound to me in detail these eight things that lead to the
cutting off of affairs in the Noble One’s Discipline, which have
been stated in brief by the Blessed One without being expounded in
detail.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, householder, and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” Potaliya the householder replied. The Blessed One
said this: [361]</P>
<P  >6.
“‘With the support of the non-killing of living beings, the
killing of living beings is to be abandoned.’ So it was said. And
with reference to what was this said? Here a noble disciple considers
thus: ‘I am practising the way to the abandoning and cutting off of
those fetters because of which I might kill living beings. If I were
to kill living beings, I would blame myself for doing so; the wise,
having investigated, would censure me for doing so; and on the
dissolution of the body, after death, because of killing living
beings an unhappy destination would be expected. But this killing of
living beings is itself a fetter and a hindrance.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote568anc" HREF="#sdendnote568sym"><SUP>dlxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
And while taints, vexation, and fever might arise through the killing
of living beings, there are no taints, vexation, and fever in one who
abstains from killing living beings.’ So it is with reference to
this that it was said: ‘With the support of the non-killing of
living beings, the killing of living beings is to be abandoned.’</P>
<P  >7.
“‘With the support of taking only what is given, the taking of
what is not given is to be abandoned.’ So it was said …</P>
<P  >8.
“‘With the support of truthful speech, false speech is to be
abandoned.’ So it was said … [362]</P>
<P  >9.
“‘With the support of unmalicious speech, malicious speech is to
be abandoned.’ So it was said …</P>
<P  >10.
“‘With the support of refraining from rapacious greed, rapacious
greed is to be abandoned.’ So it was said …</P>
<P  >11.
“‘With the support of refraining from spiteful scolding, spiteful
scolding is to be abandoned.’ So it was said … [363]</P>
<P  >12.
“‘With the support of refraining from angry despair, angry
despair is to be abandoned.’ So it was said …</P>
<P  >13.
“‘With the support of non-arrogance, arrogance is to be
abandoned.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this
said? Here a noble disciple considers thus: ‘I am practising the
way to the abandoning and cutting off of those fetters because of
which I might be arrogant. If I were to be arrogant, I would blame
myself for this; the wise, having investigated, would censure me for
this; and on the dissolution of the body, after death, because of
being arrogant an unhappy destination would be expected. But this
arrogance is itself a fetter and a hindrance. And while taints,
vexation, and fever might arise through arrogance, there are no
taints, vexation, and fever for one who is not arrogant.’ So it is
with reference to this that it was said: ‘With the support of
non-arrogance, arrogance is to be abandoned.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote569anc" HREF="#sdendnote569sym"><SUP>dlxix</SUP></A></SUP>
[364]</P>
<P  >14.
“These eight things that lead to the cutting off of affairs in the
Noble One’s Discipline have now been expounded in detail. But the
cutting off of affairs in the Noble One’s Discipline has not yet
been achieved entirely and in all ways.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, how is the cutting off of affairs in the Noble One’s
Discipline achieved entirely and in all ways? It would be good,
venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma, showing
me how the cutting off of affairs in the Noble One’s Discipline is
achieved entirely and in all ways.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, householder, and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” Potaliya the householder replied. The Blessed One
said this:</P>
<P  >15.
“Householder, suppose a dog, overcome by hunger and weakness, was
waiting by a butcher’s shop.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote570anc" HREF="#sdendnote570sym"><SUP>dlxx</SUP></A></SUP>
Then a skilled butcher or his apprentice would cut out a skeleton of
meatless bones smeared with blood and toss it to the dog. What do you
think, householder? Would that dog get rid of his hunger and weakness
by gnawing such a skeleton of meatless bones smeared with blood?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because that skeleton consisted only of
meatless bones smeared with blood. Eventually that dog would reap
weariness and disappointment.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual
pleasures have been compared to a skeleton by the Blessed One; they
provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in them is
great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdom,
he avoids the equanimity that is diversified, based on diversity, and
develops the equanimity that is unified, based on unity,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote571anc" HREF="#sdendnote571sym"><SUP>dlxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
where clinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases
without remainder.</P>
<P  >16.
“Householder, suppose a vulture, a crow, or a hawk seized a piece
of meat and flew away, and then vultures, crows, and hawks flew up
and pecked and clawed it. What do you think, householder? If that
vulture, crow, or hawk does not quickly let go of that piece of meat,
wouldn’t it incur death or deadly suffering because of that?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual
pleasures have been compared to a piece of meat by the Blessed One;
they provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in
them is great.’ [365] Having seen this thus as it actually is with
proper wisdom … clinging to the material things of the world
utterly ceases without remainder.</P>
<P  >17.
“Householder, suppose a man took a blazing grass torch and went
against the wind. What do you think, householder? If that man does
not quickly let go of that blazing grass torch, wouldn’t that
blazing grass torch burn his hand or his arm or some other part of
his body, so that he might incur death or deadly suffering because of
that?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual
pleasures have been compared to a grass torch by the Blessed One;
they provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in
them is great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom … clinging to the material things of the world utterly
ceases without remainder.</P>
<P  >18.
“Householder, suppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a man’s
height full of glowing coals without flame or smoke. Then a man came
who wanted to live and not to die, who wanted pleasure and recoiled
from pain, and two strong men seized him by both arms and dragged him
towards that charcoal pit. What do you think, householder? Would that
man twist his body this way and that?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because that man knows that if he falls
into that charcoal pit, he will incur death or deadly suffering
because of that.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual
pleasures have been compared to a charcoal pit by the Blessed One;

them is great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom … clinging to the material things of the world utterly
ceases without remainder.</P>
<P  >19.
“Householder, suppose a man dreamt about lovely parks, lovely
groves, lovely meadows, and lovely lakes, and on waking he saw
nothing of it. So too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus:
‘Sensual pleasures have been compared to a dream by the Blessed
One; they provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger
in them is great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with
proper wisdom … clinging to the material things of the world
utterly ceases without remainder.</P>
<P  >20.
“Householder, suppose a man borrowed goods on loan [366] - a fancy
carriage and fine-jewelled earrings - and preceded and surrounded by
those borrowed goods he went to the marketplace. Then people, seeing
him, would say: ‘Sirs, that is a rich man! That is how the rich
enjoy their wealth!’ Then the owners, whenever they saw him, would
take back their things. What do you think, householder? Would that be
enough for that man to become dejected?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because the owners took back their
things.”</P>
<P  >“So

<P  >21.
“Householder, suppose there were a dense grove not far from some
village or town, within which there was a tree laden with fruit but
none of its fruit had fallen to the ground. Then a man came needing
fruit, seeking fruit, wandering in search of fruit, and he entered
the grove and saw the tree laden with fruit. Thereupon he thought:
‘This tree is laden with fruit but none of its fruit has fallen to
the ground. I know how to climb a tree, so let me climb this tree,
eat as much fruit as I want, and fill my bag.’ And he did so. Then
a second man came needing fruit, seeking fruit, wandering in search
of fruit, and taking a sharp axe, he too entered the grove and saw
that tree laden with fruit. Thereupon he thought: ‘This tree is
laden with fruit but none of its fruit has fallen to the ground. I do
not know how to climb a tree, so let me cut this tree down at its
root, eat as much fruit as I want, and fill my bag.’ And he did so.
What do you think, householder? If that first man who had climbed the
tree doesn’t come down quickly, when the tree falls, wouldn’t he
break his hand or his foot or some other part of his body, [367] so
that he might incur death or deadly suffering because of that?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“So

pleasures have been compared to a fruit tree by the Blessed One; they
provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in them is
great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdom,
he avoids the equanimity that is diversified, based on diversity, and
develops the equanimity that is unified, based on unity, where

“At this point, householder, the cutting off of affairs in the

<P  >“Venerable
sir, who am I that I should possess any cutting off of affairs
entirely and in all ways like that in the Noble One’s Discipline? I
am far indeed, venerable sir, from that cutting off of affairs in the

all ways. For, venerable sir, though the wanderers of other sects are
not thoroughbreds, we imagined that they are thoroughbreds;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote572anc" HREF="#sdendnote572sym"><SUP>dlxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
though they are not thoroughbreds, we fed them the food of
thoroughbreds; though they are not thoroughbreds, we set them in the
place of thoroughbreds. But though the bhikkhus are thoroughbreds, we
imagined that they are not thoroughbreds; though they are
thoroughbreds, we fed them the food of those who are not
thoroughbreds; though they are thoroughbreds, we set them in the
place of those who are not thoroughbreds. But now, venerable sir,
[368] as the wanderers of other sects are not thoroughbreds, we shall
understand that they are not thoroughbreds; as they are not
thoroughbreds, we shall feed them the food of those who are not
thoroughbreds; as they are not thoroughbreds, we shall set them in
the place of those who are not thoroughbreds. But as the bhikkhus are
thoroughbreds, we shall understand that they are thoroughbreds; as
they are thoroughbreds, we shall feed them the food of thoroughbreds;
as they are thoroughbreds, we shall set them in the place of those
who are thoroughbreds. Venerable sir, the Blessed One has inspired in
me love for recluses, confidence in recluses, reverence for recluses.</P>

“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today
let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him

<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Mango Grove of Jivaka Komarabhacca.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote573anc" HREF="#sdendnote573sym"><SUP>dlxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Then Jivaka Komarabhacca went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >3.
“Venerable sir, I have heard this: ‘They slaughter living beings
for the recluse Gotama; the recluse Gotama knowingly eats meat
prepared for him from animals killed for his sake.’ Venerable sir,
do those who speak thus say what has been said by the Blessed One,
and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact? Do they
explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing
which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from
their assertions?” [369]</P>
<P  >4.
“Jivaka, those who speak thus do not say what has been said by me,
but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact.</P>
<P  >5.
“Jivaka, I say that there are three instances in which meat should
not be eaten: when it is seen, heard, or suspected [that the living
being has been slaughtered for the bhikkhu]. I say that meat should
not be eaten in these three instances. I say that there are three
instances in which meat may be eaten: when it is not seen, not heard,
and not suspected [that the living being has been slaughtered for the
bhikkhu]. I say that meat may be eaten in these three instances.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote574anc" HREF="#sdendnote574sym"><SUP>dlxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“Here, Jivaka, some bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain
village or town. He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third,
likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to
all as to himself, he abides pervading the allencompassing world with
a mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable,
without hostility and without ill will. Then a householder or a
householder’s son comes to him and invites him for the next day’s
meal. The bhikkhu accepts, if he likes. When the night is ended, in
the morning he dresses, and taking his bowl and outer robe, goes to
the house of that householder or householder’s son and sits down on
a seat made ready. Then the householder or householder’s son serves
him with good almsfood. He does not think: ‘How good that the
householder or householder’s son serves me with good almsfood! If
only a householder or householder’s son might serve me with such
good almsfood in the future!’ He does not think thus. He eats that
almsfood without being tied to it, infatuated with it, and utterly
committed to it, seeing the danger in it and understanding the escape
from it. What do you think, Jivaka? Would that bhikkhu on such an
occasion choose for his own affliction, or for another’s
affliction, or for the affliction of both?” - “No, venerable
sir.” - “Does not that bhikkhu sustain himself with blameless
food on that occasion?”</P>
<P  >7.
“Yes, venerable sir. I have heard this, venerable sir: ‘Brahma
abides in loving-kindness.’ Venerable sir, the Blessed One is my
visible witness to that; for the Blessed One abides in
loving-kindness.”</P>
<P  >“Jivaka,

have been abandoned by the Tathagata, cut off at the root, made like
a palm stump, done away with so that they are no longer subject to

If what you said referred to that, then I allow it to you.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, what I said referred to precisely that.”</P>
<P  >8-10.
“Here, Jivaka, a bhikkhu lives in dependence upon a certain village

compassion … with a mind imbued with appreciative joy … with a

“No, venerable sir.” - “Does not that bhikkhu sustain himself

<P  >11.
“Yes, venerable sir. I have heard this, venerable sir: ‘Brahma

<P  >“Jivaka,

If what you said referred to that, then I allow it to you.” [371]</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, what I said referred to precisely that.”</P>
<P  >12.
“If anyone slaughters a living being for the Tathagata or his
disciple, he lays up much demerit in five instances. When he says:
‘Go and fetch that living being,’ this is the first instance in
which he lays up much demerit. When. that living being experiences
pain and grief on being led along with a neck-halter, this is the
second instance in which he lays up much demerit. When he says: ‘Go
and slaughter that living being,’ this is the third instance in
which he lays up much demerit. When that living being experiences
pain and grief on being slaughtered, this is the fourth instance in
which he lays up much demerit. When he provides the Tathagata or his
disciple with food that is not permissible, this is the fifth
instance in which he lays up much demerit. Anyone who slaughters a
living being for the Tathagata or his disciple lays up much demerit
in these five instances.”</P>
<P  >13.
When this was said, Jivaka Komarabhacca said to the Blessed One: “It
is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! The bhikkhus sustain
themselves with permissible food. The bhikkhus sustain themselves
with blameless food. Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent,

56. Upali Sutta - To Upali</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Nalanda in Pavarika’s Mango Grove.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the Nigantha Nataputta was staying at Nalanda
with a large assembly of Niganthas. Then, when the Nigantha [named]
Digha Tapassi<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote578anc" HREF="#sdendnote578sym"><SUP>dlxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
had wandered for alms in Nalanda and had returned from his almsround,
after his meal he went to Pavarika’s Mango Grove to see the Blessed
One. [372] He exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and when this
courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one side. As he
stood there, the Blessed One said to him: “There are seats,
Tapassi, sit down if you like.”</P>
<P  >3.
When this was said, Digha Tapassi took a low seat and sat down at one
side. Then the Blessed One asked him: “Tapassi, how many kinds of
action does the Nigantha Nataputta describe for the performance of
evil action, for the perpetration of evil action?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Gotama, the Nigantha Nataputta is not accustomed to use the
description ‘action, action’; the Nigantha Nataputta is
accustomed to use the description ‘rod, rod. ’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote579anc" HREF="#sdendnote579sym"><SUP>dlxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Then,
Tapassi, how many kinds of rod does the Nigantha Nataputta describe
for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil
action?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Gotama, the Nigantha Nataputta describes three kinds of rod for the
performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action; that
is, the bodily rod, the verbal rod, and the mental rod.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote580anc" HREF="#sdendnote580sym"><SUP>dlxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“How
then, Tapassi, is the bodily rod one, the verbal rod another, and the
mental rod still another?”</P>
<P  >“The
bodily rod is one, friend Gotama, the verbal rod is another, and the
mental rod is still another.”</P>
<P  >“Of
these three kinds of rod, Tapassi, thus analysed and distinguished,
which kind of rod does the Nigantha Nataputta describe as the most
reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action: the bodily rod or the verbal rod or the
mental rod?”</P>
<P  >“Of
these three kinds of rod, friend Gotama, thus analysed and
distinguished, the Nigantha Nataputta describes the bodily rod as the
most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the
mental rod.”</P>
<P  >“Do
you say the bodily rod, Tapassi?”</P>
<P  >“I
say the bodily rod, friend Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“Do
you say the bodily rod, Tapassi?”</P>
<P  >“I
say the bodily rod, friend Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“Do
you say the bodily rod, Tapassi?”</P>
<P  >“I
say the bodily rod, friend Gotama.”</P>
<P  >Thus
the Blessed One made the Nigantha Digha Tapassi maintain his
statement up to the third time. [373]</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Nigantha Digha Tapassi asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >“And
you, friend Gotama, how many kinds of rod do you describe for the
performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action?”</P>
<P  >“Tapassi,
the Tathagata is not accustomed to use the description ‘rod, rod’;
the Tathagata is accustomed to use the description ‘action,
action.’“</P>
<P  >“But,
friend Gotama, how many kinds of action do you describe for the
performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action?”</P>
<P  >“Tapassi,
I describe three kinds of action for the performance of evil action,
for the perpetration of evil action: that is, bodily action, verbal
action, and mental action.”</P>
<P  >“How
then, friend Gotama, is bodily action one, verbal action another, and
mental action still another?”</P>
<P  >“Bodily
action is one, Tapassi, verbal action is another, and mental action
is still another.”</P>
<P  >“Of
these three kinds of action, friend Gotama, thus analysed and
distinguished, which kind of action do you describe as the most
reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action: bodily action or verbal action or mental
action?”</P>
<P  >“Of
these three kinds of action, Tapassi, thus analysed and
distinguished, I describe mental action as the most reprehensible for
the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action,
and not so much bodily action and verbal action.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote581anc" HREF="#sdendnote581sym"><SUP>dlxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Do
you say mental action, friend Gotama?”</P>
<P  >“I
say mental action, Tapassi.”</P>
<P  >“Do
you say mental action, friend Gotama?”</P>
<P  >“I
say mental action, Tapassi.”</P>
<P  >“Do
you say mental action, friend Gotama?”</P>
<P  >“I
say mental action, Tapassi.”</P>
<P  >Thus
the Nigantha Digha Tapassi made the Blessed One maintain his
statement up to the third time, after which he rose from his seat and
went to the Nigantha Nataputta.</P>
<P  >5.
Now on that occasion the Nigantha Nataputta was seated together with
a very large assembly of laymen from Balaka, most prominent among
them being Upali. The Nigantha Nataputta saw the Nigantha Digha
Tapassi coming in the distance and asked him: “Now where are you
coming from in the middle of the day, Tapassi?”</P>
<P  >“I
am coming from the presence of the recluse Gotama, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“Did
you have some conversation with the recluse Gotama, Tapassi?” [374]</P>
<P  >“I
had some conversation with the recluse Gotama, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“What
was your conversation with him like, Tapassi?”</P>
<P  >Then
the Nigantha Digha Tapassi related to the Nigantha Nataputta his
entire conversation with the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >6.
When this was said, the Nigantha Nataputta told him: “Good, good,
Tapassi! The Nigantha Digha Tapassi has answered the recluse Gotama
like a well-taught disciple who understands his teacher’s
dispensation rightly. What does the trivial mental rod count for in
comparison with the gross bodily rod? On the contrary, the bodily rod
is the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the
mental rod.”</P>
<P  >7.
When this was said, the householder Upali said to the Nigantha
Nataputta: “Good, good, venerable sir, [on the part of] Digha
Tapassi! The venerable Tapassi has answered the recluse Gotama like a
well-taught disciple who understands his teacher’s dispensation
rightly. What does the trivial mental rod count for in comparison
with the gross bodily rod? On the contrary, the bodily rod is the
most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the
perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the
mental rod. Now, venerable sir, I shall go and refute the recluse
Gotama’s doctrine on the basis of this statement. If the recluse
Gotama maintains before me what the venerable Digha Tapassi made him
maintain, then just as a strong man<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote582anc" HREF="#sdendnote582sym"><SUP>dlxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
might seize a long-haired ram by the hair and drag him to and drag
him fro and drag him round about, so in debate I will drag the
recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag him round about. Just as
a strong brewer’s workman might throw a big brewer’s sieve into a
deep water tank, and taking it by the corners, might drag it to and
drag it fro and drag it round about, so in debate I will drag the
recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag him round about. Just as
a strong brewer’s mixer might take a strainer by the corners and
shake it down and shake it up and thump it about, so in debate I will
shake the recluse Gotama down [375] and shake him up and thump him
about. And just as a sixty-year-old elephant might plunge into a deep
pond and enjoy playing the game of hemp-washing, so I shall enjoy
playing the game of hemp-washing with the recluse Gotama. Venerable
sir, I shall go and refute the recluse Gotama’s doctrine on the
basis of this statement.”</P>
<P  >“Go,
householder, and refute the recluse Gotama’s doctrine on the basis
of this statement. For either I should refute the recluse Gotama’s
doctrine or else the Nigantha Digha Tapassi or you yourself.”</P>
<P  >8.
When this was said, the Nigantha Digha Tapassi said to the Nigantha
Nataputta: “Venerable sir, I do not think that the householder
Upali should [try to] refute the recluse Gotama’s doctrine. For the
recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting magic by which he
converts disciples of other sectarians.”</P>
<P  >“It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen that the householder Upali
should go over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama; but it is
possible, it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to
discipleship under the householder Upali. Go, householder, and refute
the recluse Gotama’s doctrine. For either I should refute the
recluse Gotama’s doctrine or else the Nigantha Digha Tapassi or you
yourself.”</P>
<P  >For
the second time … For the third time, the Nigantha Digha Tapassi
said to the Nigantha Nataputta: “Venerable sir, I do not think that
the householder Upali should [try to] refute the recluse Gotama’s
doctrine. For the recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting
magic by which he converts disciples of other sectarians.”</P>
<P  >“It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen that the householder Upali
should go over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama; but it is
possible, it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to
discipleship under the householder Upali. Go, householder, and refute
the recluse Gotama’s doctrine. For either I should refute the
recluse Gotama’s doctrine or else the Nigantha Digha Tapassi or you
yourself.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Yes, venerable sir,” the householder Upali replied, and he rose
from his seat, and after paying homage to the Nigantha Nataputta,
keeping him on his right, he left to go to the Blessed One in
Pavarika’s Mango Grove. [376] There, after paying homage to the
Blessed One, he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed One:
“Venerable sir, did the Nigantha Digha Tapassi come here?”</P>
<P  >“The
Nigantha Digha Tapassi came here, householder.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, did you have some conversation with him?”</P>
<P  >“I
had some conversation with him, householder.”</P>
<P  >“What
was your conversation with him like, venerable sir?”</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One related to the householder Upali his entire
conversation with the Nigantha Digha Tapassi.</P>
<P  >10.
When this was said, the householder Upali said to the Blessed One:
“Good, good, venerable sir, on the part of Tapassi! The Nigantha
Digha Tapassi has answered the Blessed One like a well-taught

conversation about this.”</P>
<P  >“I

“What do you think, householder? Here some Nigantha might be
afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill [with an illness</P>
<P  >needing
treatment by cold water, which his vows prohibit] and he might refuse
cold water [though mentally longing for it] and use only [the
permissible] hot water [thus keeping his vows bodily and verbally].
Because he does not get cold water he might die. Now, householder,
where would the Nigantha Nataputta describe his rebirth [as taking
place]?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, there are gods called ‘mind-bound’; he would be reborn
there. Why is that? Because when he died he was still bound [by
attachment] in the mind.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote583anc" HREF="#sdendnote583sym"><SUP>dlxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Householder,

- and yet when going forward and returning he brings about the
destruction of many small living beings. What result does the
Nigantha Nataputta describe for him?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable

greatly reprehensible.”</P>
<P  >“But
if one wills it, householder?”</P>
<P  >“Then

<P  >“But

contrary, the Blessed One tells me: ‘Investigate thoroughly,
householder. It is good for such well-known people like you to
investigate thoroughly.’ So for the second time, venerable sir, I
go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha
of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who
has gone to him for refuge for life.”</P>
<P  >17.
“Householder, your family has long supported the Niganthas and you
should consider that alms should be given to them when they come.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed One for
telling me that. Venerable sir, I have heard that the recluse Gotama
says thus: ‘Gifts should be given only to me; gifts should not be
given to others. Gifts should be given only to my disciples; gifts
should not be given to others’ disciples. Only what is given to me
is very fruitful, not what is given to others.</P>
<P  >Only
what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to
others’ disciples.’ But, on the contrary, the Blessed One
encourages me to give gifts to the Niganthas. Anyway we shall know
the time for that, venerable sir. So for the third time, venerable
sir, I go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the
Sangha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower
who has gone to him for refuge for life.”</P>
<P  >18.
Then the Blessed One gave the householder Upali progressive
instruction, that is, talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on the
heavens; he explained the danger, degradation, and defilement in
sensual pleasures and the blessing of renunciation. When he knew that
the householder Upali’s mind [380] was ready, receptive, free from
hindrances, elated, and confident, he expounded to him the teaching
special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the
path. Just as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye
evenly, so too, while the householder Upali sat there, the spotless
immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him: “All that is subject
to arising is subject to cessation.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote588anc" HREF="#sdendnote588sym"><SUP>dlxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the householder Upali saw the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma,
understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma; he crossed beyond doubt,
did away with perplexity, gained intrepidity, and became independent
of others in the Teacher’s Dispensation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote589anc" HREF="#sdendnote589sym"><SUP>dlxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Then he said to the Blessed One: “Now, venerable sir, we must go.
We are busy and have much to do.”</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time, householder, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >19.
Then the householder Upali, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to
the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he left to return to his
own house. There he addressed the doorkeeper thus: “Good
doorkeeper, from today on I close my door to the Niganthas and the
Niganthas, and I open my door to the Blessed One’s bhikkhus,
bhikkhunas, men lay followers, and women lay followers. If any
Nigantha comes, then tell him thus: ‘Wait, venerable sir, do not
enter. From today on the householder Upali has gone over to
discipleship under the recluse Gotama. He has closed his door to the
Niganthas and Niganthas, and he has opened it to the Blessed One’s
bhikkhus, bhikkhunas, men lay followers, and women lay followers.
Venerable sir, if you need alms, wait here; they will bring it to you
here.’“- “Yes, venerable sir,” the doorkeeper replied.</P>
<P  >20.
The Nigantha Digha Tapassi heard: “The householder Upali has gone
over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama.” Then he went to the
Nigantha Nataputta and told him: “Venerable sir, I have heard thus:
‘The householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the
recluse Gotama.’“</P>
<P  >“It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen that the householder Upali
should go over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama; but it is
possible, it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to
discipleship under the householder Upali.” [381]</P>
<P  >A
second time … And a third time the Nigantha Digha Tapassi told the
Nigantha Nataputta: “Venerable sir, I have heard thus: ‘The
householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse
Gotama.’“</P>
<P  >“It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen … ”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, shall I go and find out whether or not the householder Upali has
gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama?”</P>
<P  >“Go,
Tapassi, and find out whether or not he has gone over to discipleship
under the recluse Gotama.”</P>
<P  >21.
Then the Nigantha Digha Tapassi went to the householder Upali’s
house. The doorkeeper saw him coming in the distance and told him:
“Wait, venerable sir, do not enter. From today on the householder
Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama. He has
closed his door to the Niganthas and Niganthas, and he has opened it
to the Blessed One’s bhikkhus, bhikkhunas, men lay followers, and
women lay followers. Venerable sir, if you need alms, wait here; they
will bring it to you here.”</P>
<P  >“I
do not need alms, friend,” he said, and he turned back and went to
the Nigantha Nataputta and told him: “Venerable sir, it is only too
true that the householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under
the recluse Gotama. Venerable sir, I did not get your consent when I
told you: ‘Venerable sir, I do not think that the householder Upali
should [try to] refute the recluse Gotama’s doctrine. For the
recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting magic by which he
converts disciples of other sectarians.’ And now, venerable sir,
your householder Upali has been converted by the recluse Gotama with
his converting magic!”</P>
<P  >“It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen that the householder Upali
should go over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama; but it is
possible, it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to
discipleship under the householder Upali.”</P>
<P  >A
second time … And a third time the Nigantha Digha Tapassi told the
Nigantha Nataputta: “Venerable sir, it is only too true that the
householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under the recluse
Gotama [382] … with his converting magic!”</P>
<P  >“It
is impossible, Tapassi, it cannot happen … it can happen that the
recluse Gotama might come over to discipleship under the householder
Upali. Now I shall go myself and find out whether or not he has gone
over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama.”</P>
<P  >22.
Then the Nigantha Nataputta went with a large assembly of Niganthas
to the householder Upali s house. The doorkeeper saw him coming in
the distance and told him: “Wait, venerable sir, do not enter. From
today on the householder Upali has gone over to discipleship under
the recluse Gotama. He has closed his door to the Niganthas and
Niganthas, and he has opened his door to the Blessed One’s
bhikkhus, bhikkhunas, men lay followers, and women lay followers.
Venerable sir, if you need alms, wait here; they will bring it to you
here.”</P>
<P  >“Good
doorkeeper, go to the householder Upali and tell him: ‘Venerable
sir, the Nigantha Nataputta is standing at the outer gate with a
large assembly of Niganthas; he wishes to see you.’“</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” he replied, and he went to the householder Upali
and told him: “Venerable sir, the Nigantha Nataputta is standing at
the outer gate with a large assembly of Niganthas; he wishes to see
you.”</P>
<P  >“In
that case, good doorkeeper, make seats ready in the hall of the
central door.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” he replied, and after he had made seats ready in
the hall of the central door, he returned to the householder Upali
and told him: “Venerable sir, the seats are made ready in the hall
of the central door. Now it is time to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >23.
Then the householder Upali [383] went to the hall of the central door
and sat down on the highest, best, chief, most excellent seat there.
Then he told the doorkeeper: “Now, good doorkeeper, go to the
Nigantha Nataputta and tell him:</P>
<P  >‘Venerable
sir, the householder Upali says: “Enter, venerable sir, if you
wish.””</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” he replied, and he went to the Nigantha Nataputta
and told him: “Venerable sir, the householder Upali says: ‘Enter,
venerable sir, if you wish.’“</P>
<P  >Then
the Nigantha Nataputta went with the large assembly of Niganthas to
the hall of the central door.</P>
<P  >24.
Previously, when the householder Upali saw the Nigantha Nataputta
coming in the distance, he used to go out to meet him, dust off the
highest, best, chief, most excellent seat there with an upper robe,
and having arranged it all around, have him seated on it. But now,
while seated himself on the highest, best, chief, most excellent
seat, he told Nigantha Nataputta: “Venerable sir, there are seats;
sit down if you wish.”</P>
<P  >25.
When this was said, the Nigantha Nataputta said: “Householder, you
are mad, you are an imbecile. You went saying: ‘Venerable sir, I
shall refute the recluse Gotama’s doctrine,’ and you have come
back all caught up in a vast net of doctrine. Just as if a man went
to castrate someone and came back castrated on both sides, just as if
a man went to put out someone’s eyes and came back with both his
eyes put out; so you too, householder, went saying: ‘Venerable sir,
I shall refute the recluse Gotama’s doctrine,’ and you have come
back all caught up in a vast net of doctrine. Householder, you have
been converted by the recluse Gotama with his converting magic!”</P>
<P  >26.
“Auspicious is that converting magic, venerable sir, good is that
converting magic!<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote590anc" HREF="#sdendnote590sym"><SUP>dxc</SUP></A></SUP>
Venerable sir, if my beloved kinsmen and relatives were to be
converted by this conversion, it would lead to the welfare and
happiness of my beloved kinsmen and relatives for a long time. If all
nobles were to be converted by this conversion, it would lead to the
welfare and happiness of the nobles for a long time. [384] If all
brahmins … all merchants … all workers were to be converted by
this conversion, it would lead to the welfare and happiness of the
workers for a long time. If the world with its gods, its Maras, and
its Brahmas, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its
princes and its people, were to be converted by this conversion, it
would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long time.
As to this, venerable sir, I shall give you a simile; for some wise
men here understand the meaning of a statement by a simile.</P>
<P  >27.
“Venerable sir, there was once a brahmin who was old, aged, and
burdened with years, and he had as a wife a young brahmin girl who
was pregnant and near her confinement. Then she told him: ‘Go,
brahmin, buy a young monkey in the market and bring it back to me as
a playmate for my child.’ He replied: ‘Wait, madam, till you have
borne the child. If you bear a boy, then I will go to the market and
buy a young male monkey and bring it back to you as a playmate for
your little boy; but if you bear a girl, then I will go to the market
and buy a young female monkey and bring it back to you as a playmate
for your little girl.’ For the second time she made the same
request and received the same answer. For the third time she made the
same request. Then, since his mind was bound to her with love, he
went to the market, bought a young male monkey, brought it back, and
told her: ‘I have bought this young male monkey in the market [385]
and brought it back to you as a playmate for your child.’ Then she
told him: ‘Go, brahmin, take this young male monkey to Rattapani
the dyer’s son and tell him: “Good Rattapani, I want this young
male monkey dyed the colour called yellow-unguent, pounded and
re-pounded, and smoothened out on both sides.’“Then, since his
mind was bound to her with love, he took the young male monkey to
Rattapani the dyer’s son and told him: ‘Good Rattapani, I want
this young male monkey dyed the colour called yellow-unguent, pounded
and re-pounded, and smoothened out on both sides.’ Rattapani the
dyer’s son told him: ‘Venerable sir, this young male monkey will
take a dyeing but not a pounding or a smoothening out.’ So too,
venerable sir, the doctrine of the foolish Niganthas will give
delight to fools but not to the wise, and it will not withstand
testing or being smoothened out.</P>
<P  >“Then,
venerable sir, on another occasion that brahmin took a pair of new
garments to Rattapani the dyer’s son and told him: ‘Good
Rattapani, I want this pair of new garments dyed the colour called
yellow-unguent, pounded and re-pounded, and smoothened out on both
sides.’ Rattapani the dyer’s son told him: ‘Venerable sir, this
pair of new garments will take a dyeing and a pounding and a
smoothening out.’ So too, venerable sir, the doctrine of that
Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, will give delight to
the wise but not to fools, and it will withstand testing and being
smoothened out.”</P>
<P  >28.
“Householder, the assembly and the king know you thus: ‘The
householder Upali is a disciple of the Nigantha Nataputta.’ Whose
disciple should we consider you to be?”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the householder Upali rose from his seat, and
arranging his upper robe on one shoulder, [3861 he extended his hands
in reverential salutation in the direction of the Blessed One and
told the Nigantha Nataputta:</P>

“When did you concoct that hymn of praise to the recluse Gotama,

<P  >“Venerable
sir, suppose there were a great heap of many kinds of flowers, [387]
and then a clever garland-maker or garland-maker’s apprentice were

praiseworthy qualities. Who, venerable sir, would not praise the

Then, since the Nigantha Nataputta was unable to bear this honour

57. Kukkuravatika Sutta - The Dog-duty Ascetic</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Koliyan country at a town of the Koliyans named Haliddavasana.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Punna, son of the Koliyans, an ox-duty ascetic, and also Seniya,
a naked dog-duty ascetic, went to the Blessed One.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote600anc" HREF="#sdendnote600sym"><SUP>dc</SUP></A></SUP>
Punna, the ox-duty ascetic, paid homage to the Blessed One and sat
down at one side, while Seniya, the naked dog-duty ascetic, exchanged
greetings with the Blessed One, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he too sat down at one side curled up like a dog.
Punna, the ox-duty ascetic, said to the Blessed One: “Venerable
sir, this Seniya is a naked dogduty ascetic who does what is hard to
do: he eats his food when it is thrown to the ground. He has long
taken up and practised that dog-duty. What will be his destination?
What will be his future course?”</P>
<P  >“Enough,
Punna, let that be. Do not ask me that.”</P>
<P  >A
second time … And a third time Punna, the ox-duty ascetic, said to
the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, this Seniya is a naked dog-duty
ascetic who does what is hard to do: he eats his food when it is
thrown to the ground. He has long taken up and practised that
dog-duty. What will be his destination? What will be his future
course?”</P>
<P  >“Well,
Punna, since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say: ‘Enough,
Punna, let that be. Do not ask me that,’ I shall therefore answer
you.</P>
<P  >3.
“Here, Punna, someone develops the dog-duty fully and
uninterruptedly; he develops the dog-habit fully and uninterruptedly;
he develops the dog-mind fully [388] and uninterruptedly; he develops
dog-behaviour fully and uninterruptedly. Having done so, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of
dogs. But if he has such a view as this: ‘By this virtue or
observance or asceticism or holy life I shall become a [great] god or
some [lesser] god,’ that is wrong view in his case. Now there are
two destinations for one with wrong view, I say: hell or the animal
realm.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote601anc" HREF="#sdendnote601sym"><SUP>dci</SUP></A></SUP>
So, Punna, if his dog-duty succeeds, it will lead him to the company
of dogs; if it fails, it will lead him to hell.”</P>
<P  >4.
When this was said, Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic cried out and
burst into tears. Then the Blessed One told Punna, son of the
Koliyans, the ox-duty ascetic: “Punna, I could not persuade you
when I said: ‘Enough, Punna, let that be. Do not ask me that.””</P>
<P  >[Then
Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic said:] “Venerable sir, I am not
crying because the Blessed One has said this about me, but because I
have long taken up and practised this dog-duty. Venerable sir, this
Punna, son of the Koliyans, is an ox-duty ascetic. He has long taken
up and practised that ox-duty. What will be his destination? What
will be his future course?”</P>
<P  >“Enough,
Seniya, let that be. Do not ask me that.”</P>
<P  >A
second time … And a third time Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic
asked the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, this Punna, son of the
Koliyans, is an ox-duty ascetic. He has long taken up and practised
that ox-duty. What will be his destination? What will be his future
course?”</P>
<P  >“Well,
Seniya, since I certainly cannot persuade you when I say: ‘Enough,
Seniya, let that be. Do not ask me that,’ I shall therefore answer
you.</P>
<P  >5.
“Here, Seniya, someone develops the ox-duty fully and
uninterruptedly; he develops the ox-habit fully and uninterruptedly;
he develops the ox-mind fully and uninterruptedly; he develops
ox-behaviour fully and uninterruptedly. Having done so, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of
oxen. [389] But if he has such a view as this: ‘By this virtue or
observance or asceticism or holy life I shall become a [great] god or
some [lesser] god,’ that is wrong view in his case. Now there are
two destinations for one with wrong view, I say: hell or the animal
realm. So, Seniya, if his ox-duty succeeds, it will lead him to the
company of oxen; if it fails, it will lead him to hell.”</P>
<P  >6.
When this was said, Punna, son of the Koliyans, the ox-duty ascetic
cried out and burst into tears. Then the Blessed One told Seniya the
naked dog-duty ascetic: “Seniya, I could not persuade you when I
said: ‘Enough, Seniya, let that be. Do not ask me that.’“</P>
<P  >[Then
Purina the ox-duty ascetic said:] “Venerable sir, I am not crying
because the Blessed One has said this about me, but because I have
long taken up and practised this ox-duty. Venerable sir, I have
confidence in the Blessed One thus: ‘The Blessed One is capable of
teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can abandon this ox-duty
and that this Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic can abandon that
dog-duty.’“</P>
<P  >“Then,
Punna, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes,
venerable sir,” he replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >7.
“Punna, there are four kinds of action proclaimed by me after
realising them for myself with direct knowledge. What are the four?
There is dark action with dark result; there is bright action with
bright result; there is dark-and-bright action with dark-and-bright
result; and there is action that is neither dark nor bright with
neither-dark-nor-bright result, action that leads to the destruction
of action.</P>
<P  >8.
“And what, Punna, is dark action with dark result? Here someone
generates an afflictive bodily formation, an afflictive verbal
formation, an afflictive mental formation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote602anc" HREF="#sdendnote602sym"><SUP>dcii</SUP></A></SUP>

afflictive world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote603anc" HREF="#sdendnote603sym"><SUP>dciii</SUP></A></SUP>
When he has reappeared in an afflictive world, afflictive contacts
touch him. Being touched by afflictive contacts, he feels afflictive
feelings, extremely painful, as in the case of the beings in [390]
hell. Thus a being’s reappearance is due to a being:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote604anc" HREF="#sdendnote604sym"><SUP>dciv</SUP></A></SUP>
one reappears through the actions one has performed. When one has
reappeared, contacts touch one. Thus I say beings are the heirs of
their actions. This is called dark action with dark result.</P>
<P  >9.
“And what, Punna, is bright action with bright result? Here someone
generates an unafflictive bodily formation, an unafflictive verbal
formation, an unafflictive mental formation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote605anc" HREF="#sdendnote605sym"><SUP>dcv</SUP></A></SUP>

one reappears through the actions one has performed. When one has

“And what, Punna, is dark-and-bright action with darkand-bright
result? Here someone generates a bodily formation that is both
afflictive and unafflictive, a verbal formation that is both
afflictive and unafflictive, a mental formation that is both
afflictive and unafflictive.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote607anc" HREF="#sdendnote607sym"><SUP>dcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Having generated a bodily formation, a verbal formation, a mental
formation that is both afflictive and unafflictive, he reappears in a
world that is both afflictive and unafflictive. When he has
reappeared in a world that is both afflictive and unafflictive, both
afflictive and unafflictive contacts touch him. Being touched by both
afflictive and unafflictive contacts, he feels both afflictive and
unafflictive feelings, mingled pleasure and pain, as in the case of
human beings and some gods and some beings in the lower worlds. Thus
a being’s reappearance is due to a being: one reappears through the
actions one has performed. When one has reappeared, contacts touch
one. Thus I say beings are the heirs to their actions. This is called
dark-and-bright action with dark-and-bright result. [391]</P>
<P  >11.
“And what, Punna, is action that is neither dark nor bright with
neither-dark-nor-bright result, action that leads to the destruction
of action? Therein, the volition in abandoning the kind of action
that is dark with dark result, and the volition in abandoning the
kind of action that is bright with bright result, and the volition in
abandoning the kind of action that is dark and bright with
dark-and-bright result: this is called action that is neither dark
nor bright with neither-dark-nor-bright result, action that leads to
the destruction of action.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote608anc" HREF="#sdendnote608sym"><SUP>dcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
These are the four kinds of action proclaimed by me after realising
them for myself with direct knowledge.”</P>
<P  >12.
When this was said, Punna, son of the Koliyans, the oxduty ascetic
said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent,
venerable sir! The Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways
… From today let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who
has gone to him for refuge for life.”</P>
<P  >13.
But Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic said to the Blessed One:
“Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! The
Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to the Blessed One for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would
receive the going forth under the Blessed One, I would receive the
full admission.”</P>
<P  >14.
“Seniya, one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires the
going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline
lives on probation for four months.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote609anc" HREF="#sdendnote609sym"><SUP>dcix</SUP></A></SUP>
At the end of four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him,
they give him the going forth and the full admission to the bhikkhus’
state. But I recognise individual differences in this matter.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote610anc" HREF="#sdendnote610sym"><SUP>dcx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the
going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live
on probation for four months, and if at the end of the four months
the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus’ state, then I will live on
probation for four years. At the end of the four years if the
bhikkhus are satisfied with me, let them give me the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus’ state.”</P>
<P  >15.
Then Seniya the naked dog-duty ascetic received the going forth under
the Blessed One, and he received the full admission. And soon, not
long after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn, [392]
diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Seniya, by realising
for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and
abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which
clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. He
directly knew: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived,
what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any
state of being.” And the venerable Seniya became one of the
arahants.</P>

58. Abhayarajakumara Sutta - To Prince Abhaya</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Prince Abhaya<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote611anc" HREF="#sdendnote611sym"><SUP>dcxi</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the Nigantha Nataputta, and after paying homage to him, sat
down at one side. Thereupon the Nigantha Nataputta said to him:</P>
<P  >3.
“Come, prince, refute the recluse Gotama’s doctrine, and a good
report of you will be spread to this effect: ‘Prince Abhaya has
refuted the doctrine of the recluse Gotama, who is so powerful and
mighty.’“</P>
<P  >“But
how, venerable sir, shall I refute his doctrine?”</P>
<P  >“Come,
prince, go to the recluse Gotama and say: ‘Venerable sir, would the
Tathagata utter speech that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to
others?’ If the recluse Gotama, on being asked thus, answers: ‘The
Tathagata, prince, would utter speech that would be unwelcome and
disagreeable to others,’ then say to him: ‘Then, venerable sir,
what is the difference between you and an ordinary person? For an
ordinary person also would utter speech that would be unwelcome and
disagreeable to others.’ But if the recluse Gotama, on being asked
thus, answers: ‘The Tathagata, prince, would not utter speech [393]
that would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others,’ then say to
him: ‘Then, venerable sir, why have you declared of Devadatta:
“Devadatta is destined for the states of deprivation, Devadatta is
destined for hell, Devadatta will remain [in hell] for the aeon,
Devadatta is incorrigible”? Devadatta was angry and dissatisfied
with that speech of yours.’ When the recluse Gotama is posed this
two-horned question by you, he will not be able either to gulp it
down or to throw it up. If an iron spike were stuck in a man’s
throat, he would not be able either to gulp it down or to throw it
up; so too, prince, when the recluse Gotama is posed this two-homed
question by you, he will not be able either to gulp it down. or to
throw it up.”</P>
<P  >4.
“Yes, venerable sir,” Prince Abhaya replied. Then he rose from
his seat, and after paying homage to the Nigantha Nataputta, keeping
him on his right, he left and went to the Blessed One. After paying
homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side, looked at the
sun, and thought: “It is too late today to refute the Blessed One’s
doctrine. I shall refute the Blessed One’s doctrine in my own house
tomorrow.” Then he said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, let
the Blessed One with three others consent to accept tomorrow’s meal
from me.” The Blessed One consented in silence.</P>
<P  >5.
Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, Prince Abhaya rose
from his seat, and after paying homage to him, keeping him on his
right, he departed. Then, when the night had ended, it being morning,
the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went
to Prince Abhaya’s house and sat down on the seat made ready. Then,
with his own hands, Prince Abhaya served and satisfied the Blessed
One with various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One had eaten
and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, Prince Abhaya took a low
seat, sat down at one side, and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >6.
“Venerable sir, would a Tathagata utter such speech as would be
unwelcome and disagreeable to others?”</P>
<P  >“There
is no one-sided answer to that, prince.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
venerable sir, the Niganthas have lost in this.”</P>
<P  >“Why
do you say this, prince: [394] ‘Then, venerable sir, the Niganthas
have lost in this’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote612anc" HREF="#sdendnote612sym"><SUP>dcxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Prince
Abhaya then reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with
the Nigantha Nataputta.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion a young tender infant was lying prone on Prince
Abhaya’s lap. Then the Blessed One said to Prince Abhaya: [395]
“What do you think, prince? If, while you or your nurse were not
attending to him, this child were to put a stick or a pebble in his
mouth, what would you do to him?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I would take it out. If I could not take it out at once, I would
take his head in my left hand, and crooking a finger of my right
hand, I would take it out even if it meant drawing blood. Why is
that? Because I have compassion for the child.”</P>
<P  >8.
“So too, prince, such speech as the Tathagata knows to be untrue,
incorrect, and unbeneficial, and which is also unwelcome and
disagreeable to others: such speech the Tathagata does not utter.
Such speech as the Tathagata knows to be true and correct but
unbeneficial, and which is also unwelcome and disagreeable to others:
such speech the Tathagata does not utter. Such speech as the
Tathagata knows to be true, correct, and beneficial, but which is
unwelcome and disagreeable to others: the Tathagata knows the time to
use such speech.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote613anc" HREF="#sdendnote613sym"><SUP>dcxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
Such speech as the Tathagata knows to be untrue, incorrect, and
unbeneficial, but which is welcome and agreeable to others: such
speech the Tathagata does not utter. Such speech as the Tathagata
knows to be true and correct but unbeneficial, and which is welcome
and agreeable to others: such speech the Tathagata does not utter.
Such speech as the Tathagata knows to be true, correct, and
beneficial, and which is welcome and agreeable to others: the
Tathagata knows the time to use such speech. Why is that? Because the
Tathagata has compassion for beings.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Venerable sir, when learned nobles, learned brahmins, learned
householders, and learned recluses, after formulating a question,
then go to the Blessed One and pose it, has there already been in the
Blessed One’s mind the thought: ‘If they come to me and ask me
thus, I shall answer thus’? Or does that answer occur to the
Tathagata on the spot?”</P>
<P  >10.
“As to that, prince, I shall ask you a question in return. Answer
it as you choose. What do you think, prince? Are you skilled in the
parts of a chariot?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir, I am.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, prince? When people come to you and ask: ‘What is the
name of this part of the chariot?’ has there already been in your
mind the thought: [396] ‘If they come to me and ask me thus, I
shall answer them thus’? Or does that answer occur to you on the
spot?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I am well known as a charioteer skilled in the parts of a
chariot. All the parts of a chariot are well known to me. That answer
would occur to me on the spot.”</P>
<P  >11.
“So too, prince, when learned nobles, learned brahmins, learned
householders, and learned recluses, after formulating a question,
then come to the Tathagata and pose it, the answer occurs to the
Tathagata on the spot. Why is that? That element</P>
<P  >of
things has been fully penetrated by the Tathagata, through the full
penetration of which the answer occurs to the Tathagata on the
spot.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote614anc" HREF="#sdendnote614sym"><SUP>dcxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
When this was said, Prince Abhaya said: “Magnificent, venerable
sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! The Blessed One has made the Dhamma
clear in many ways … From today let the Blessed One remember me as
a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.”</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading60"  >
59. Bahuvedaniya Sutta - The Many Kinds of Feeling</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the carpenter Pancakanga<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote615anc" HREF="#sdendnote615sym"><SUP>dcxv</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the venerable Udayin, and after paying homage to him, he sat
down at one side and asked him:</P>
<P  >3.
“Venerable sir, how many kinds of feeling have been stated by the
Blessed One?”</P>
<P  >“Three
kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One, householder:
pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neitherpainful-nor-pleasant
feeling. [397] These three kinds of feeling have been stated by the
Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >“Not
three kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One, venerable
Udayin; two kinds of feeling have been stated by the Blessed One:
pleasant feeling and painful feeling. This
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling has been stated by the Blessed
One as a peaceful and sublime kind of pleasure.”</P>
<P  >A
second time and a third time the venerable Udayin stated his
position, and a second time and a third time the carpenter Pancakanga
stated his. But the venerable Udayin could not convince the carpenter
Pancakanga nor could the carpenter Pancakanga convince the venerable
Udayin.</P>
<P  >4.
The venerable Ananda heard their conversation. Then he went to the
Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side
and reported to the Blessed One the entire conversation between the
venerable Udayin and the carpenter Pancakanga. When he had finished,
the Blessed One told the venerable Ananda:</P>
<P  >5.
“Ananda, it was actually a true presentation that the carpenter
Pancakanga would not accept from Udayin, and it was actually a true
presentation that Udayin would not accept from the carpenter
Pancakanga. I have stated two kinds of feeling in one presentation;
[398] I have stated three kinds of feeling in another presentation; I
have stated five kinds of feeling in another presentation; I have
stated six kinds of feeling in another presentation; I have stated
eighteen kinds of feeling in another presentation; I have stated
thirty-six kinds of feeling in another presentation; I have stated
one hundred and eight kinds of feeling in another presentation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote616anc" HREF="#sdendnote616sym"><SUP>dcxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how the Dhamma has been shown by me in [different]
presentations.</P>
<P  >“When
the Dhamma has thus been shown by me in [different] presentations, it
may be expected of those who will not concede, allow, and accept what
is well stated and well spoken by others that they will take to
quarreling, brawling, and disputing, stabbing each other with verbal
daggers. But it may be expected of those who concede, allow, and
accept what is well stated and well spoken by others that they will
live in concord, with mutual appreciation, without disputing,
blending like milk and water, viewing each other with kindly eyes.</P>
<P  >6.
“Ananda, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure. What are
the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.
Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of
sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >7.
“Should anyone say: ‘That is the utmost pleasure and joy that
beings experience,’ I would not concede that to him. Why is that?
Because there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime
than that pleasure. And what is that other kind of pleasure? Here,
Ananda, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. This is that other kind of
pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >8.
“Should anyone say: ‘That is the utmost pleasure and joy that
beings experience,’ I would not concede that to him. [399]</P>
<P  >Why
is that? Because there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more
sublime than that pleasure. And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has
self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. This is
that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the
previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >9.
“Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu
abides in equanimity, mindful and fully aware, and still feeling
pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana,
on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding
who has equanimity and is mindful.’ This is that other kind of
pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >10.
“Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana, which has neitherpain-nor-pleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. This is that other kind of
pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote617anc" HREF="#sdendnote617sym"><SUP>dcxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
“Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form,
with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is
infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite
space. This is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime
than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >12.
“Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, by completely surmounting the base of infinite space,
aware that ‘consciousness is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the base of infinite consciousness. This is that other kind
of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >13.
“Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the base of nothingness.</P>
<P  >This
is that other kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the
previous pleasure. [400]</P>
<P  >14.
“Should anyone say … And what is that other kind of pleasure?
Here, Ananda, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This is that other kind of
pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >15.
“Should anyone say: ‘That is the utmost pleasure and joy that
beings experience,’ I would not concede that to him. Why is that?
Because there is another kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime
than that pleasure. And what is that other kind of pleasure? Here,
Ananda, by completely surmounting the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is that other
kind of pleasure loftier and more sublime than the previous pleasure.</P>
<P  >16.
“It is possible, Ananda, that wanderers of other sects might speak
thus: ‘The recluse Gotama speaks of the cessation of perception and
feeling and he describes that as pleasure. What is this, and how is
this?’ Wanderers of other sects who speak thus should be told:
‘Friends, the Blessed One describes pleasure not only with
reference to pleasant feeling; rather, friends, the Tathagata
describes as pleasure any kind of pleasure wherever and in whatever
way it is found. ’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote618anc" HREF="#sdendnote618sym"><SUP>dcxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading61"  >
60. Apannaka Sutta - The Incontrovertible Teaching</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually
he arrived at a Kosalan brahmin village named Sala.</P>
<P  >2.
The brahmin householders of Sala heard: “The recluse Gotama, the
son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been
wandering in the Kosalan country [401] with a large Sangha of
bhikkhus and has come to Sala. Now a good report of Master Gotama has
been spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is accomplished,
fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime,
knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher
of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with
its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this generation with its
recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, which he has
himself realised with direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma good in
the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the
right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is
utterly perfect and pure.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then the brahmin householders of Sala went to the Blessed One. Some
paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their hands in
reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one
side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One’s
presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at
one side.</P>
<P  >4.
When they were seated, the Blessed One asked them: “Householders,
is there any teacher agreeable to you in whom you have acquired faith
supported by reasons?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote619anc" HREF="#sdendnote619sym"><SUP>dcxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir, there is no teacher agreeable to us in whom we have
acquired faith supported by reasons.”</P>
<P  >“Since,
householders, you have not found an agreeable teacher, you may
undertake and practise this incontrovertible teaching;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote620anc" HREF="#sdendnote620sym"><SUP>dcxx</SUP></A></SUP>
for when the incontrovertible teaching is accepted and undertaken, it
will lead to your welfare and happiness for a long time. And what is
the incontrovertible teaching ?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote621anc" HREF="#sdendnote621sym"><SUP>dcxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(I. THE DOCTRINE OF NIHILISM)</H3>
<P  >5.
(A) “Householders, there are some recluses and brahmins whose
doctrine and view is this: ‘There is nothing given, nothing
offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and bad
actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no
beings who are reborn spontaneously; no good and virtuous recluses
and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by direct
knowledge and declare this world and the other world.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote622anc" HREF="#sdendnote622sym"><SUP>dcxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
[402]</P>
<P  >6.
(B) “Now there are some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine is
directly opposed to that of those recluses and brahmins, and they say
thus: ‘There is what is given and what is offered and what is
sacrificed; there is fruit and result of good and bad actions; there
is this world and the other world; there is mother and father; there
are beings who are reborn spontaneously; there are good and virtuous
recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves realised by
direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.’ What
do you think, householders? Don’t these recluses and brahmins hold
doctrines directly opposed to each other?” - “Yes, venerable
sir.”</P>
<P  >7.
(A.i) “Now, householders, of those recluses and brahmins whose
doctrine and view is this: ‘There is nothing given … no good and
virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have themselves
realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other
world,’ it is to be expected that they will avoid these three
wholesome states, namely, good bodily conduct, good verbal conduct,
and good mental conduct, and that they will undertake and practise
these three unwholesome states, namely, bodily misconduct, verbal
misconduct, and mental misconduct. Why is that? Because those good
recluses and brahmins do not see in unwholesome states the danger,
degradation, and defilement, nor do they see in wholesome states the
blessing of renunciation, the aspect of cleansing.</P>
<P  >8.
(A.ii) “Since there actually is another world, one who holds the
view ‘there is no other world’ has wrong view. Since there
actually is another world, one who intends ‘there is no other
world’ has wrong intention. Since there actually is another world,
one who makes the statement ‘there is no other world’ has wrong
speech. Since there actually is another world, one who says ‘there
is no other world’ is opposed to those arahants who know the other
world. Since there actually is another world, one who convinces
another ‘there is no other world’ convinces him to accept an
untrue Dhamma; and because he convinces another to accept an untrue
Dhamma, he praises himself and disparages others. Thus any pure
virtue that he formerly had is abandoned and corrupt conduct is
substituted.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote623anc" HREF="#sdendnote623sym"><SUP>dcxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
And this wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, opposition to
noble ones, convincing another to accept an untrue Dhamma, and
self-praise and disparagement of others - these several evil
unwholesome states thus come into being with wrong view as their
condition. [403]</P>
<P  >9.
(A.iii) “About this a wise man considers thus: ‘If there is no
other world, then on the dissolution of the body this good person
will have made himself safe enough.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote624anc" HREF="#sdendnote624sym"><SUP>dcxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
But if there is another world, then on the dissolution of the body,
after death, he will reappear in a state of deprivation, in an
unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. Now whether or not
the word of those good recluses and brahmins is true, let me assume
that there is no other world: still this good person is here and now
censured by the wise as an immoral person, one of wrong view who
holds the doctrine of nihilism.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote625anc" HREF="#sdendnote625sym"><SUP>dcxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
But on the other hand, if there is another world, then this good
person has made an unlucky throw on both counts: since he is censured
by the wise here and now, and since on the dissolution of the body,
after death, he will reappear in a state of deprivation, in an
unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. He has wrongly
accepted and undertaken this incontrovertible teaching in such a way
that it extends only to one side and excludes the wholesome
alternative.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote626anc" HREF="#sdendnote626sym"><SUP>dcxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >10.
(B.i) “Now, householders, of those recluses and brahmins whose
doctrine and view is this: ‘There is what is given … there are
good and virtuous recluses.and brahmins in the world who</P>

takes what is not given, breaks into houses, plunders wealth, commits
burglary, ambushes highways, seduces another’s wife, utters
falsehood - no evil is done by the doer. If, with a razorrimmed

of flesh, into one heap of flesh, because of this there would be no
evil and no outcome of evil. If one were to go along the south bank

61. Ambalatthikarahulovada Sutta - Advice to Rahula at Ambalatthika</H2>
<P  >[414]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Rahula was living at
Ambalatthika.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote637anc" HREF="#sdendnote637sym"><SUP>dcxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and
went to the venerable Rahula at Ambalatthika. The venerable Rahula
saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and made a seat ready and
set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the
seat made ready and washed his feet. The venerable Rahula paid homage
to him and sat down at one side.</P>
<P  >3.
Then the Blessed One left a little water in the water vessel and
asked the venerable Rahula: “Rahula, do you see this little water
left in the water vessel?” - “Yes, venerable sir.” - “Even so
little, Rahula, is the recluseship of those who are not ashamed to
tell a deliberate lie.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One threw away the little water that was left and
asked the venerable Rahula: “Rahula, do you see that little water
that was thrown away?” - “Yes, venerable sir.” - “Even so,
Rahula, those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie have
thrown away their recluseship.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then the Blessed One turned the water vessel upside down and asked
the venerable Rahula: “Rahula, do you see this water vessel turned
upside down?” - “Yes, venerable sir.” - “Even so, Rahula,
those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie have turned their
recluseship upside down.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then the Blessed One turned the water vessel right way up again and
asked the venerable Rahula: “Rahula, do you see this hollow, empty
water vessel?” - “Yes, venerable sir.” - “Even so hollow and
empty, Rahula, is the recluseship of those who are not ashamed to
tell a deliberate lie.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Suppose, Rahula, there were a royal tusker elephant with tusks as
long as chariot poles, full-grown in stature, high-bred, and
accustomed to battle. In battle he would perform his task with his
forefeet and his hindfeet, with his forequarters and his
hindquarters, with his head and his ears, with his tusks and his
tail, [415] yet he would keep back his trunk. Then his rider would
think: ‘This royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as chariot
poles … performs his task in battle with his forefeet and his
hindfeet. . .yet he keeps back his trunk. He has not yet given up his
life.’ But when the royal tusker elephant … performs his task in
battle with his forefeet and his hindfeet, with his forequarters and
his hindquarters, with his head and his ears, with his tusks and his
tail, and also with his trunk, then his rider would think: ‘This
royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as chariot poles …
performs his task in battle with his forefeet and his hindfeet …
and also with his trunk. He has given up his life. Now there is
nothing this royal tusker elephant would not do.’ So too, Rahula,
when one is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no evil, I
say, that one would not do. Therefore, Rahula, you should train thus:
‘I will not utter a falsehood even as a joke.’</P>
<P  >8.
“What do you think, Rahula? What is the purpose of a mirror?”</P>
<P  >“For
the purpose of reflection, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, Rahula, an action with the body should be done after repeated
reflection; an action by speech should be done after repeated
reflection; an action by mind should be done after repeated
reflection.</P>
<P  >9.
“Rahula, when you wish to do an action with the body, you should
reflect upon that same bodily action thus: ‘Would this action that
I wish to do with the body lead to my own affliction, or to the
affliction of others, or to the affliction of both? Is it an
unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, with painful
results?’ When you reflect, if you know: ‘This action that I wish
to do with the body would lead to my own affliction, or to the
affliction of others, or to the affliction of both; it is an
unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, with painful
results,’ then you definitely should not do such an action with the
body. [416] But when you reflect, if you know: ‘This action that I

On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s
Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. The venerable
Rahula also [421] dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe,
followed close behind the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >3.
Then the Blessed One looked back and addressed the venerable Rahula
thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote641anc" HREF="#sdendnote641sym"><SUP>dcxli</SUP></A></SUP>
“Rahula, any kind of material form whatever, whether past, future,
or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or
superior, far or near, all material form should be seen as it
actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am
not, this is not my self.’“</P>
<P  >“Only
material form, Blessed One? Only material form, Sublime One?”</P>
<P  >“Material
form, Rahula, and feeling, perception, formations, and
consciousness.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the venerable Rahula considered thus: “Who would go into the
town for alms today when personally admonished by the Blessed One?”
Thus he turned back and sat down at the root of a tree, folding his
legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness
in front of him.</P>
<P  >5.
The venerable Sariputta saw him sitting there and addressed him thus:
“Rahula, develop mindfulness of breathing. When mindfulness of
breathing is developed and cultivated, it is of great fruit and great
benefit.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote642anc" HREF="#sdendnote642sym"><SUP>dcxlii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

Then, when it was evening, the venerable Rahula rose from meditation
and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down
at one side and asked the Blessed One:</P>

“Venerable sir, how is mindfulness of breathing developed and

lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach,
feces, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is solid,
solidified, and clung-to: this is called the internal earth element.
Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element
are simply earth element. And that should be seen as it actually is
with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is

is, that by which one is warmed, ages, and is consumed, and that by
which what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets completely
digested, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is fire,
fiery, and clung-to: this is called the internal fire element. Now
both the internal fire element and the external fire element are
simply fire element. And that should be seen as it actually is with

nostrils, the door of the mouth, and that [aperture] whereby what is
eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets swallowed, and where it
collects, and whereby it is excreted from below, or whatever else
internally, belonging to oneself, is space, spatial, and clung-to:
this is called the internal space element. Now both the internal

<H2 NAME="Heading64"  >
63. Culamalunkya Sutta - The Shorter Discourse to<BR>Malunkyaputta</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, while the venerable Malunkyaputta was alone in meditation, the
following thought arose in his mind:</P>
<P  >“These
speculative views have been undeclared by the Blessed One, set aside
and rejected by him, namely: ‘the world is eternal’ and ‘the
world is not eternal’; ‘the world is finite’ and ‘the world
is infinite’; ‘the soul is the same as the body’ and ‘the
soul is one thing and the body another’; and ‘after death a
Tathagata exists’ and ‘after death a Tathagata does not exist’
and ‘after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist’ and
‘after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist.’ The
Blessed One does not declare these to me, and I do not approve of and
accept the fact that he does not declare these to me, so I shall go
to the Blessed One and ask him the meaning of this. If he declares to
me either ‘the world is eternal’ or ‘the world is not eternal’
… or ‘after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist,’
then I will lead the holy life under him; if he does not declare
these to me, then I will abandon the training and return to the low
life.” [427]</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Malunkyaputta rose from
meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him,
he sat down at one side and told him:</P>
<P  >“Here,
venerable sir, while I was alone in meditation, the following thought
arose in my mind: ‘These speculative views have been undeclared by
the Blessed One … If he does not declare these to me, then I will
abandon the training and return to the low life.’ If the Blessed
One knows ‘the world is eternal,’ let the Blessed One declare to
me ‘the world is eternal’; if the</P>
<P  >Blessed
One knows ‘the world is not eternal,’ let the Blessed One declare
to me ‘the world is not eternal.’ If the Blessed One does not
know either ‘the world is eternal’ or ‘the world is not
eternal,’ then it is straightforward for one who does not know and
does not see to say: ‘I do not know, I do not see.’</P>
<P  >“If
the Blessed One knows ‘the world is finite,’ … ’the world is
infinite,’ … ’the soul is the same as the body,’ … ’the
soul is one thing and the body another,’ … ’after death a
Tathagata exists,’ [428] … ’after death a Tathagata does not
exist,’.. .If the Blessed One knows ‘after death a Tathagata both
exists and does not exist,’ let the Blessed One declare that to me;
if the Blessed One knows ‘after death a Tathagata neither exists
nor does not exist,’ let the Blessed One declare that to me. If the
Blessed One does not know either ‘after death a Tathagata both
exists and does not exist’ or ‘after death a Tathagata neither
exists nor does not exist,’ then it is straightforward for one who
does not know and does not see to say: ‘I do not know, I do not
see.’“</P>
<P  >4.
“How then, Malunkyaputta, did I ever say to you: ‘Come,
Malunkyaputta, lead the holy life under me and I will declare to you
“the world is eternal” … or “after death a Tathagata neither
exists nor does not exist’”?” - “No, venerable sir.” - “Did
you ever tell me: ‘I will lead the holy life under the Blessed One,
and the Blessed One will declare to me “the world is eternal” …
or “after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist’”?”
- “No, venerable sir.” - “That being so, misguided man, who are
you and what are you abandoning?</P>
<P  >5.
“If anyone should say thus: ‘I will not lead the holy life under
the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me “the world is
eternal” … or “after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does
not exist,’“[429] that would still remain undeclared by the
Tathagata and meanwhile that person would die. Suppose,
Malunkyaputta, a man were wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with
poison, and his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives,
brought a surgeon to treat him. The man would say: ‘I will not let
the surgeon pull out this arrow until I know whether the man who
wounded me was a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker.’ And
he would say: ‘I will not let the surgeon pull out this arrow until
I know the name and clan of the man who wounded me; … until I know
whether the man who wounded me was tall or short or of middle height;
… until I know whether the man who wounded me was dark or brown or
golden-skinned; … until I know whether the man who wounded me lives
in such a village or town or city; … until I know whether the bow
that wounded me was a long bow or a crossbow; … until I know
whether the bowstring that wounded me was fibre or reed or sinew or
hemp or bark; … until I know whether the shaft that wounded me was
wild or cultivated; … until I know with what kind of feathers the
shaft that wounded me was fitted - whether those of a vulture or a
crow or a hawk or a peacock or a stork; … until I know with what
kind of sinew the shaft that wounded me was bound - whether that of
an ox or a buffalo or a lion or a monkey; … until I know what kind
of arrow it was that wounded me - whether it was hoof-tipped or
curved or barbed or calf-toothed or oleander.’ [430]</P>
<P  >“All
this would still not be known to that man and meanwhile he would die.
So too, Malunkyaputta, if anyone should say thus: ‘I will not lead
the holy life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to
me: “the world is eternal” … or “after death a Tathagata
neither exists nor does not exist,’“that would still remain
undeclared by the Tathagata and meanwhile that person would die.</P>
<P  >6.
“Malunkyaputta, if there is the view ‘the world is eternal,’
the holy life cannot be lived; and if there is the view ‘the world
is not eternal,’ the holy life cannot be lived. Whether there is
the view ‘the world is eternal’ or the view ‘the world is not
eternal,’ there is birth, there is ageing, there is death, there
are sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, the destruction of
which I prescribe here and now.</P>
<P  >“If
there is the view ‘the world is finite,’ … ‘the world is
infinite,’ … ’the soul is the same as the body,’ … ’the
soul is one thing and the body another,’ … ‘after death a
Tathagata exists,’ … ’after death a Tathagata does not exist,’
the holy life cannot be lived … [431] If there is the view ‘after
death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist,’ the holy life
cannot be lived; and if there is the view ‘after death a Tathagata
neither exists nor does not exist,’ the holy life cannot be lived.
Whether there is the view ‘after death a Tathagata both exists and
does not exist’ or the view ‘after death a Tathagata neither
exists nor does not exist,’ there is birth, there is ageing, there
is death, there are sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair,
the destruction of which I prescribe here and now.</P>
<P  >7.
“Therefore, Malunkyaputta, remember what I have left undeclared as
undeclared, and remember what I have declared as declared. And what
have I left undeclared? ‘The world is eternal’ - I have left
undeclared. ‘The world is not eternal’ - I have left undeclared.
‘The world is finite’ - I have left undeclared. ‘The world is
infinite’ - I have left undeclared. ‘The soul is the same as the
body’ - I have left undeclared. ‘The soul is one thing and the
body another’ - I have left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathagata
exists’ - I have left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathagata does
not exist’ - I have left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathagata
both exists and does not exist’ - I have left undeclared. ‘After
death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist’ - I have left
undeclared.</P>
<P  >8.
“Why have I left that undeclared? Because it is unbeneficial, it
does not belong to the fundamentals of the holy life, it does not
lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to
direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. That is why I have
left it undeclared.</P>
<P  >9.
“And what have I declared? ‘This is suffering’ - I have
declared. ‘This is the origin of suffering’ - I have declared.
‘This is the cessation of suffering’ - I have declared. ‘This

declared.</P>

Thereupon, the venerable Ananda said: “It is the time, Blessed One,
it is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One to teach the five
lower fetters. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus
will remember it.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, Ananda, and attend closely to what I shall say.” “Yes,
venerable sir,” the venerable Ananda replied. The Blessed One said
this:</P>

“Here, Ananda, an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for
noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who
has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in
their Dhamma, abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by personality
view, and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from
the arisen personality view; and when that personality view has
become habitual and is uneradicated in him, it is a lower fetter. He
abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by doubt … by adherence to
rules and observances … by sensual lust [434] … by ill will, and

will; and when that ill will has become habitual and is uneradicated

“There is a path, Ananda, a way to the abandoning of the five lower

know or see or abandon the five lower fetters - this is not possible.

<P  >“The

<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading66"  >
65. Bhaddali Sutta - To Bhaddali</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I eat at a single session. By so doing, I am free from
illness and affliction, and I enjoy health, strength, and a
comfortable abiding.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote660anc" HREF="#sdendnote660sym"><SUP>dclx</SUP></A></SUP>
Come, bhikkhus, eat at a single session. By so doing, you too will be
free from illness and affliction, and you will enjoy health,
strength, and a comfortable abiding.”</P>
<P  >3.
When this was said, the venerable Bhaddali told the Blessed One:
“Venerable sir, I am not willing to eat at a single session; for if
I were to do so, I might have worry and anxiety about it.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote661anc" HREF="#sdendnote661sym"><SUP>dclxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Then,
Bhaddali, eat one part there where you are invited and bring away one
part to eat. By eating in that way, [438] you will maintain
yourself.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I am not willing to eat in that way either; for if I were to do
so, I might also have worry and anxiety about it.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote662anc" HREF="#sdendnote662sym"><SUP>dclxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
Then, when this training precept was being made known by the Blessed
One,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote663anc" HREF="#sdendnote663sym"><SUP>dclxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
the venerable Bhaddali publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus
his unwillingness to undertake the training. Then the venerable
Bhaddali did not present himself to the Blessed One for the whole of
that three-month period [of the Rains], as he did riot fulfil the
training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.</P>
<P  >5.
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were engaged in making up a
robe for the Blessed One, thinking: “With his robe completed, at
the end of the three months [of the Rains], the Blessed One will set
out wandering.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then the venerable Bhaddali went to those bhikkhus and exchanged
greetings with them, and when this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side. When he had done so, they said to
him: “Friend Bhaddali, this robe is being made up for the Blessed
One. With his robe completed, at the end of the three months [of the
Rains], the Blessed One will set out wandering. Please, friend
Bhaddali, give proper attention to your declaration. Do not let it
become more difficult for you later on.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Yes, friends,” he replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and
after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said:
“Venerable sir, a transgression overcame me, in that like a fool,
confused and blundering, when a training precept was being made known
by the Blessed One, I publicly declared in the Sangha of bhikkhus my
unwillingness to undertake the training. Venerable sir, may the
Blessed One forgive my transgression seen as such for the sake of
restraint in the future.”</P>
<P  >8.
“Surely, Bhaddali, a transgression overcame you, in that like a
fool, confused and blundering, when a training precept was being made

unwillingness to undertake the training.</P>

“Venerable sir, a transgression overcame me, in that like a fool,

<P  >“No,

<P  >“No,

“Yes, venerable sir. Venerable sir, a transgression overcame me, in

was being made known by the Blessed One, I publicly declared in the
Sangha of bhikkhus my unwillingness to undertake the training.

“Here, Bhaddali, some bhikkhu does not fulfil the training in the

mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle
thicket, an open space, a heap of straw - perhaps I might realise a
superhuman state, a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the
noble ones.’ He resorts to some such secluded resting-place. While
he lives thus withdrawn, the Teacher censures him, wise companions in
the holy life who have made investigation censure him, gods censure
him, and he censures himself. Being censured in this way by the
Teacher, by wise companions in the holy life, by gods, and by
himself, he realises no superhuman state, no distinction in knowledge

“When his concentrated mind is thus purified and bright,

Thereupon the venerable Bhaddali asked: “Venerable sir, what is the
cause, what is the reason, why they take action against some bhikkhu
here by repeatedly admonishing him? What is the cause, what is the
reason, why they do not take such action against some bhikkhu here by
repeatedly admonishing him?”</P>
<P  >23.
“Here, Bhaddali, some bhikkhu is a constant offender with many
offences. When he is corrected by the bhikkhus, he prevaricates,
leads the talk aside, shows disturbance, hate, and bitterness; he
does not proceed rightly, he does not comply, he does not clear
himself, he does not say: ‘Let me so act that the Sangha will be
satisfied.’ [443] Bhikkhus, taking account of this matter, think:
‘It would be good if the venerable ones examine this bhikkhu in
such a way that this litigation against him is not settled too
quickly.’ And the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in such a way that
the litigation against him is not settled too quickly.</P>
<P  >24.
“But here some bhikkhu is a constant offender with many offences.
When he is corrected by the bhikkhus, he does not prevaricate, lead
the talk aside, or show disturbance, hate, and bitterness; he
proceeds rightly, he complies, he clears himself, he says: ‘Let me
so act that the Sangha will be satisfied.’ Bhikkhus, taking account
of this matter, think: ‘It would be good if the venerable ones
examine this bhikkhu in such a way that this litigation against him
is settled quickly.’ And the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in such
a way that the litigation against him is settled quickly.</P>
<P  >25.
“Here some bhikkhu is a chance offender without many offences. When
he is corrected by the bhikkhus, he prevaricates … (repeat rest of
§23) … And the bhikkhus examine that bhikkhu in such a way that
[444] the litigation against him is not settled too quickly.</P>

“Here some bhikkhu progresses by a measure of faith and love.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote666anc" HREF="#sdendnote666sym"><SUP>dclxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
In this case bhikkhus consider thus: ‘Friends, this bhikkhu
progresses by a measure of faith and love. Let him not lose that
measure of faith and love, as he may if we take action against him by
repeatedly admonishing him.’ Suppose a man had only one eye; then
his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives, would guard
his eye, thinking: ‘Let him not lose his one eye.’ So too, some
bhikkhu progresses by a measure of faith and love … ‘Let him not

<P  >29.
“Venerable sir, what is the cause, what is the reason, why there
were previously [445] fewer training rules and more bhikkhus became
established in final knowledge? What is the cause, what is the
reason, why there are now more training rules and fewer bhikkhus
become established in final knowledge?”</P>
<P  >30.
“That is how it is, Bhaddali. When beings are deteriorating and the
true Dhamma is disappearing, then there are more training rules and
fewer bhikkhus become established in final knowledge. The Teacher
does not make known the training rule for disciples until certain
things that are the basis for taints become manifest here in the
Sangha;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote667anc" HREF="#sdendnote667sym"><SUP>dclxvii</SUP></A></SUP>

the Sangha has reached greatness, then those things that are the

Teacher makes known the training rule for disciples in order to ward
off those things that are the basis for taints. Those things that are
the basis for taints do not become manifest here in the Sangha until
the Sangha has reached the acme of worldly gain … the acme of fame
… the acme of great learning … the acme of long-standing renown;
but when the Sangha has reached the acme of long-standing renown,
then those things that are the basis for taints become manifest here

the simile of the young thoroughbred colt. Do you remember that,

hear the Mamma with eager ears.’ Still, Bhaddali, I will teach you

While the colt is being made to get used to wearing the bit, because
he is doing something that he has never done before, he displays some
contortion, writhing, and vacillation, but through constant
repetition and gradual practice, he becomes peaceful in that action.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote668anc" HREF="#sdendnote668sym"><SUP>dclxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“When
the colt has become peaceful in that action, the horsetrainer further
makes him get used to wearing the harness. While the colt is being
made to get used to wearing the harness, because he is doing
something that he has never done before, he displays some contortion,
writhing, and vacillation, but through constant repetition and
gradual practice, he becomes peaceful in that action.</P>
<P  >“When
the colt has become peaceful in that action, the horsetrainer further
makes him act in keeping in step, in running in a circle, in
prancing, in galloping, in charging, in the kingly qualities, in the
kingly heritage, in the highest speed, in the highest fleetness, in
the highest gentleness. While the colt is being made to get used to
doing these things, because he is doing something that he has never
done before, he displays some contortion, writhing, and vacillation,
but through constant repetition and gradual practice, he becomes
peaceful in those actions.</P>
<P  >“When
the colt has become peaceful in these actions, the horse-trainer
further rewards him with a rubbing down and a grooming. When a fine
thoroughbred colt possesses these ten factors, he is worthy of the
king, in the king’s service, and considered one of the factors of a
king.</P>
<P  >34.
“So too, Bhaddali, when a bhikkhu possesses ten qualities, he is
worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy
of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the
world. What are the ten? Here, Bhaddali, a bhikkhu possesses the
right view of one beyond training,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote669anc" HREF="#sdendnote669sym"><SUP>dclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
the right intention of one beyond training, the right speech of one
beyond training, the right action of one beyond training, the right
livelihood of one beyond training, the right effort of one beyond
training, [447] the right mindfulness of one beyond training, the
right concentration of one beyond training, the right knowledge of
one beyond training, and the right deliverance of one beyond
training.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote670anc" HREF="#sdendnote670sym"><SUP>dclxx</SUP></A></SUP>
When a bhikkhu possesses these ten qualities, he is worthy of gifts,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential
salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Bhaddali was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading67"  >
66. Latukikopama Sutta - The Simile of the Quail</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
country of the Anguttarapans at a town of theirs named Apana.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Apana for alms. When he had wandered
for alms in Apana and had returned from his almsround, after his meal
he went to a certain grove for the day’s abiding. Having entered
the grove, he sat down at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding.</P>
<P  >3.
When it was morning, the venerable Udayin dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, he too went into Apana for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Apana and had returned from his almsround, after
his meal he went to that same grove for the day’s abiding. Having
entered the grove, he sat down at the root of a tree for the day’s
abiding.</P>
<P  >4.
Then, while the venerable Udayin was alone in meditation, the
following thought arose in his mind: “How many painful states has
the Blessed One rid us of! How many pleasant states has the Blessed
One brought us! How many unwholesome states has the Blessed One rid
us of! How many wholesome states has the Blessed One brought us!”</P>
<P  >5.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Udayin rose from meditation,
went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down
at one side [448] and told him:</P>
<P  >6.
“Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in meditation, the
following thought arose in my mind: ‘How many painful states has
the Blessed One rid us of! … How many wholesome states has the
Blessed One brought us!’ Venerable sir, formerly we used to eat in
the evening, in the morning, and during the day outside the proper
time. Then there was an occasion when the</P>
<P  >Blessed
One addressed the bhikkhus thus: ‘Bhikkhus, please abandon that
daytime meal outside the proper time.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote671anc" HREF="#sdendnote671sym"><SUP>dclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
Venerable sir, I was upset and sad, thinking: ‘Faithful
householders give us good food of various kinds during the day
outside the proper time, yet the Blessed One tells us to abandon it,
the Sublime One tells us to relinquish it.’ Out of our love and
respect for the Blessed One, and out of shame and fear of wrongdoing,
we abandoned that daytime meal outside the proper time.</P>
<P  >“Then
we ate only in the evening and in the morning. Then there was an
occasion when the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: ‘Bhikkhus,
please abandon that night meal, which is outside the proper time.’
Venerable sir, I was upset and sad, thinking: ‘The Blessed One
tells us to abandon the more sumptuous of our two meals, the Sublime
One tells us to relinquish it.’ Once, venerable sir, a certain man
had obtained some soup during the day and he said: ‘Put that aside
and we will all eat it together in the evening.’ [Nearly] all
cooking is done at night, little by day. Out of our love and respect
for the Blessed One, and out of shame and fear of wrongdoing, we
abandoned that night meal, which was outside the proper time.</P>
<P  >“It
has happened, venerable sir, that bhikkhus wandering for alms in the
thick darkness of the night have walked into a cesspit, fallen into a
sewer, walked into a thornbush, and fallen over a sleeping cow; they
have met hoodlums who had already committed a crime and those
planning one, and they have been sexually enticed by women. Once,
venerable sir, I went wandering for alms in the thick darkness of the
night. A woman washing a pot saw me by a flash of lightning and
screamed out in terror: ‘Mercy me, a devil has come for me!’ I
told her: ‘Sister, I am no devil, I am a bhikkhu [449] waiting for
alms.’ -’Then it’s a bhikkhu whose ma’s died and whose pa’s
died!<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote672anc" HREF="#sdendnote672sym"><SUP>dclxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Better, bhikkhu, that you get your belly cut open with a sharp
butcher’s knife than this prowling for alms for your belly’s sake
in the thick darkness of the night!’ Venerable sir, when I
recollected that I thought: ‘How many painful states has the
Blessed One rid us of! How many pleasant states has the Blessed One
brought us! How many unwholesome states has the Blessed One rid us
of! How many wholesome states has the Blessed One brought us!’“</P>
<P  >7.
“So too, Udayin, there are certain misguided men here who, when
told by me ‘Abandon this,’ say: ‘What, such a mere trifle, such
a little thing as this? ‘This recluse is much too exacting!’ And
they do not abandon that and they show discourtesy towards me as well
as towards those bhikkhus desirous of training. For them that thing
becomes a strong, stout, tough, unrotting tether and a thick yoke.</P>
<P  >8.
“Suppose, Udayin, a quail were tethered by a rotting creeper and
would thereby expect injury, captivity, or death. Now suppose someone
said: ‘The rotting creeper by which that quail is tethered and
thereby expects injury, captivity, or death, is for her a feeble,
weak, rotting, coreless tether.’ Would he be speaking rightly?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. For that quail the rotting creeper by which she is
tethered and thereby expects injury, captivity, or death, is a
strong, stout, tough, unrotting tether and a thick yoke.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, Udayin there are certain misguided men here who, when told by me
‘Abandon this’ … do not abandon that and they show discourtesy
towards me as well as towards those bhikkhus desirous of training.
For them that thing becomes a strong, stout, tough, unrotting tether
and a thick yoke.</P>
<P  >9.
“Udayin, there are certain clansmen here who, [450] when told by me
‘Abandon this,’ say: ‘What, such a mere trifle, such a little
thing to be abandoned as this, the Blessed One tells us to abandon,
the Sublime One tells us to relinquish.’ Yet they abandon that and
do not show discourtesy towards me or towards those bhikkhus desirous
of training. Having abandoned it, they live at ease, unruffled,
subsisting on others’ gifts, with mind [as aloof] as a wild deer’s.
For them that thing becomes a feeble, weak, rotting, coreless tether.</P>
<P  >10.
“Suppose, Udayin, a royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as
chariot-poles, full-grown in stature, high-bred and accustomed to
battle, were tethered by stout leather thongs, but by simply twisting
his body a little he could break and burst the thongs and then go
where he likes. Now suppose someone said: ‘The stout leather thongs
by which this royal tusker elephant is tethered … are for him a
strong, stout, tough, unrotting tether and a thick yoke.’ Would he
be speaking rightly?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. The stout leather thongs by which that royal tusker
elephant is tethered, which by simply twisting his</P>

a little he could break and burst and then go where he likes, are for
him a feeble, weak, rotting, coreless tether.”</P>
<P  >“So

“Suppose, Udayin, there were a poor, penniless, destitute man, and
he had one dilapidated hovel open to the crows, not the best kind,
and one dilapidated wicker bedstead, not the best kind, [451] and
some grain and pumpkin seeds in a pot, not the best kind, and one hag
of a wife, not the best kind. He might see a bhikkhu in a monastery
park sitting in the shade of a tree, his hands and feet well washed
after he had eaten a delicious meal, devoting himself to the higher
mind. He might think: ‘How pleasant the recluse’s state is! How
healthy the recluse’s state is! If only I could shave off my hair
and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life
into homelessness!’ But being unable to abandon his one dilapidated
hovel open to the crows, not the best kind, and his one dilapidated
wicker bedstead, not the best kind, and his grain and pumpkin seeds
in a pot, not the best kind, and his hag of a wife, not the best
kind, he is unable to shave off his hair and beard, put on the yellow
robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness. Now suppose
someone said: ‘The tethers by which that man is tethered so that he
cannot abandon his one dilapidated hovel … and his hag of a wife,
not the best kind, and shave off his hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness - for
him those are a feeble, weak, rotting, coreless tether.’ Would he
be speaking rightly?”</P>
<P  >“No,

cannot abandon his one dilapidated hovel … and his hag of a wife,

“Suppose, Udayin, there were a rich householder or a householder’s
son, [452] with great wealth and property, with a vast number of gold
ingots, a vast number of granaries, a vast number of fields, a vast
amount of land, a vast number of wives, and a vast number of men and

think: ‘How pleasant the recluse’s state is! How healthy the

When he is practising the way, memories and intentions associated

“There are, Udayin, five cords of sensual pleasure. What are the
five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,

<P  >2.
Now on that occasion five hundred bhikkhus headed by the venerable
Sariputta and the venerable Maha Moggallana had come to Catuma to see
the Blessed One. While the visiting bhikkhus were exchanging
greetings with the resident bhikkhus, and were preparing resting
places and putting away their bowls and outer robes, they were very
loud and noisy.</P>
<P  >3.
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda thus: “Ananda,
who are these loud noisy people? One would think they were fishermen

“Then, Ananda, tell those bhikkhus in my name that the Teacher
calls the venerable ones.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,

them: “The Teacher calls the venerable ones.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,

after paying homage to him, sat down at one side. When they had done
so, the Blessed One asked them: “Bhikkhus, why are you so loud and
noisy? One would think you were fishermen hawking fish.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable

“Go, bhikkhus, I dismiss you. You cannot live with me.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,

after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on their right,
they put away the things in their resting places, and taking their
bowls and outer robes, they departed.</P>
<P  >6.
Now on that occasion the Sakyans of Catuma had met together in their
assembly hall for some business or other. Seeing the bhikkhus coming
in the distance, they went to them and asked: “Where are you going,
venerable sirs?”</P>
<P  >“Friends,
the Sangha of bhikkhus has been dismissed by the Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >“Then
let the venerable ones be seated awhile. Perhaps we shall be able to
restore his confidence.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
friends,” they replied.</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Sakyans of Catuma went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, they sat down at one side and said:</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, let the Blessed One delight in the Sangha of bhikkhus; venerable
sir, let the Blessed One welcome the Sangha of bhikkhus; venerable
sir, let the Blessed One show compassion towards the Sangha of

Venerable sir, there are new bhikkhus here, just gone forth, recently
come to this Dhamma and Discipline. If they get no opportunity to see
the Blessed One, there may take place in them some change or
alteration. Venerable sir, just as when young seedlings get no water
there may take place in them some change or alteration, so too,
venerable sir, there are [458] new bhikkhus here, just gone forth,
recently come to this Dhamma and Discipline. If they get no
opportunity to see the Blessed One, there may take place in them some

Then the Brahma Sahampati<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote683anc" HREF="#sdendnote683sym"><SUP>dclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
knew with his mind the thought in the Blessed One’s mind, so just
as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his

Blessed One. Then he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and
extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed
One, he said:</P>
<P  >9.
“Venerable sir, let the Blessed One delight in the Sangha of
bhikkhus; venerable sir, let the Blessed One welcome the Sangha of
bhikkhus; … (as in §7) … [459] now as he used to show compassion
towards it in the past.”</P>
<P  >10.
The Sakyans of Catuma and the Brahma Sahampati were able to restore
the Blessed One’s confidence with the similes of the seedlings and
the young calf.</P>
<P  >11.
Then the venerable Maha Moggallana addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Get
up, friends, take your bowls and outer robes. The Blessed One’s
confidence has been restored by the Sakyans of Catuma and the Brahma
Sahampati with the similes of the seedlings and the young calf.”</P>
<P  >12.
“Yes, friend,” they replied, and taking their bowls and outer
robes, they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him,
sat down at one side. When they had done so, the Blessed One asked
the venerable Sariputta: “What did you think, Sariputta, when the
Sangha of bhikkhus was dismissed by me?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I thought thus: ‘The Sangha of bhikkhus has been dismissed by
the Blessed One. The Blessed One will now abide inactive, devoted to
pleasant abiding here and now; and we too shall now abide inactive,
devoted to pleasant abiding here and now.’“</P>
<P  >“Stop,
Sariputta, stop! Such a thought should not be entertained by you
again”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote684anc" HREF="#sdendnote684sym"><SUP>dclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Maha Moggallana: “What
did you think, Moggallana, when the Sangha of bhikkhus was dismissed
by me?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I thought thus: ‘The Sangha of bhikkhus has been dismissed by
the Blessed One. The Blessed One will now abide inactive, devoted to
pleasant abiding here and now. Now the venerable Sariputta and I
shall lead the Sangha of bhikkhus.’“</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Moggallana! Either I shall lead the Sangha of bhikkhus or else
Sariputta and Moggallana shall lead it.”</P>
<P  >14.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhus,
there are these four kinds of fears to be expected by those who go
down to the water.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote685anc" HREF="#sdendnote685sym"><SUP>dclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
What are the four? They are: fear of waves, fear of crocodiles, fear
of whirlpools, and fear of sharks. These are the four kinds of fears
to be expected by those who go down to the water.</P>
<P  >15.
“So too, bhikkhus, there are four kinds of fears to be expected by
certain persons who have gone forth from the home life into
homelessness in this Dhamma and Discipline. What are [460] the four?
They are: fear of waves, fear of crocodiles, fear of whirlpools, and
fear of sharks.</P>
<P  >16.
“What, bhikkhus, is fear of waves? Here some clansman goes forth
out of faith from the home life into homelessness, considering: ‘I
am a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to
suffering. Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be
known.’ Then, after he has gone forth thus, his companions in the
holy life advise and instruct him thus: ‘You should move to and fro
thus; you should look ahead and look away thus; you should flex and
extend the limbs thus; you should wear the patched cloak, bowl, and
robes thus.’ Then he thinks: ‘Formerly, when we were in the home
life, we advised and instructed others, and now these [bhikkhus], who
seem like they might be our sons or our grandsons, think that they
can advise and instruct us.’ And so he forsakes the training and
reverts to the low life. He is called one who has forsaken the
training and reverted to the low life because he was frightened by
the fear of waves. Now ‘waves’ is a term for angry despair.</P>
<P  >17.
“What, bhikkhus, is fear of crocodiles? Here some clansman goes
forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, considering:
‘I am a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation,

holy life advise and instruct him thus: ‘This can be consumed by
you, this cannot be consumed by you; this can be eaten by you, this

cannot consume food outside the proper time; you can eat within the

the proper time.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote687anc" HREF="#sdendnote687sym"><SUP>dclxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
[461]</P>
<P  >“Then

what we liked and did not consume what we did not like; we ate what
we liked and did not eat what we did not like; we tasted what we
liked and did not taste what we did not like; we drank what we liked
and did not drink what we did not like. We consumed what was
allowable and what was not allowable; we ate what was allowable and
what was not allowable; we tasted what was allowable and what was not
allowable; we drank what was allowable and what was not allowable. We
consumed food within the proper time and outside the proper time; we
ate within the proper time and outside the proper time; we tasted
food within the proper time and outside the proper time; we drank
within the proper time and outside the proper time. Now, when
faithful householders give us good food of various kinds during the
day outside the proper time, it seems these [bhikkhus] put a muzzle
on our mouths.’ And so he forsakes the training and reverts to the
low life. He is called one who has forsaken the training and reverted
to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of crocodiles.
Now ‘crocodiles’ is a term for gluttony.</P>
<P  >18.
“What, bhikkhus, is fear of whirlpools? Here some clansman goes
forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, considering:
‘I am a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to
suffering. Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be
known.’ Then, after he has gone forth thus, when it is morning he
dresses, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he goes into a village
or town for alms with his body unguarded, with his speech unguarded,
with mindfulness unestablished, and with sense faculties
unrestrained. He sees some householder there or householder’s son
furnished and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure
enjoying himself with them. He considers thus: ‘Formerly, when we
were in the home life, we were furnished and endowed with the five
cords of sensual pleasure and we enjoyed ourselves with them. My
family has wealth; I can both enjoy wealth and make merit.’ And so
he forsakes the training and reverts to the low life. He is called
one who has forsaken the training and reverted to the low life
because he was frightened by the fear of whirlpools. Now ‘whirlpools’
is a term for the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >19.
“What, bhikkhus, is fear of sharks? Here [462] some clansman goes
forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, considering:
‘I am a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to
suffering. Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be

dresses, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he goes into a village
or town for alms with his body unguarded, with his speech unguarded,
with mindfulness unestablished, and with sense faculties
unrestrained. He sees a woman there lightly clothed, lightly dressed.
When he sees such a woman, lust infects his mind. Because his mind
has been infected by lust, he forsakes the training and reverts to
the low life. He is called one who has forsaken the training and
reverted to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of
sharks. Now ‘sharks’ is a term for women.</P>
<P  >20.
“Bhikkhus, these are the four kinds of fears to be expected by
certain persons who have gone forth from the home life into
homelessness in this Dhamma and Discipline.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading69"  >
68. Nalakapana Sutta - At Nalakapana</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Kosalan country at Nalakapana in the Palasa Grove.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion many very well-known clansmen had gone forth out
of faith from the home life into homelessness under the Blessed One -
the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, the venerable
Kimbila, the venerable Bhagu, the venerable Kundadhana, the venerable
Revata, the venerable Ananda, and other very well-known clansmen.</P>
<P  >3.
And on that occasion the Blessed One was [463] seated in the open
surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, referring to those
clansmen, he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, those clansmen
who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness
under me - do they delight in the holy life?”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, those bhikkhus were silent.</P>
<P  >A
second and a third time, referring to those clansmen, he addressed
the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, those clansmen who have gone forth
out of faith from the home life into homelessness under me - do they
delight in the holy life?”</P>
<P  >For
a second and third time, those bhikkhus were silent.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One considered thus: “Suppose I question those
clansmen?”</P>
<P  >Then
he addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus: “Anuruddha, do you all
delight in the holy life?”</P>
<P  >“Surely,
venerable sir, we delight in the holy life.”</P>
<P  >5.
“Good, good, Anuruddha! It is proper for all you clansmen who have
gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness to
delight in the holy life. As you are still endowed with the blessing
of youth, black-haired young men in the prime of life, you could have
indulged in sensual pleasures, yet you have gone forth from the home
life into homelessness. It is not because you have been driven by
kings that you have gone forth from the home life into homelessness,
or because you have been driven by thieves, or owing to debt, fear,
or want of a livelihood. Rather, did you not go forth out of faith
from the home life into homelessness after considering thus: ‘I am
a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to suffering.
Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known’?”
- “Yes, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >6.
“What should be done, Anuruddha, by a clansman who has gone forth
thus? While he still does not attain to the rapture and pleasure that
are secluded from sensual pleasures and secluded from unwholesome
states, or to something more peaceful than that,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote688anc" HREF="#sdendnote688sym"><SUP>dclxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
covetousness invades his mind and remains, ill will invades his mind
and remains, sloth and torpor invade his mind and remain,
restlessness and remorse invade his mind and remain, doubt invades
[464] his mind and remains, discontent invades his mind and remains,
weariness invades his mind and remains. That is so while he still
does not attain to the rapture and pleasure that are secluded from
sensual pleasures and secluded from unwholesome states, or to
something more peaceful than that. When he attains to the rapture and
pleasure that are secluded from sensual pleasures and secluded from
unwholesome states, or to something more peaceful than that,
covetousness does not invade his mind and remain, ill will … sloth
and torpor … restlessness and remorse … doubt … discontent …
weariness does not invade his mind and remain. That is so when he
attains to the rapture and pleasure that are secluded from sensual
pleasures and secluded from unwholesome states, or to something more
peaceful than that.</P>
<P  >7.
“How then, Anuruddha, do you all think of me in this way: ‘The
Tathagata has not abandoned the taints that defile, bring renewal of
being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth,
ageing, and death. That is why the Tathagata uses one thing after
reflecting, endures another thing after reflecting, avoids another
thing after reflecting, and removes another thing after
reflecting’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote689anc" HREF="#sdendnote689sym"><SUP>dclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir, we do not think of the Blessed One in that way. We
think of the Blessed One in this way: ‘The Tathagata has abandoned
the taints that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen
in suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death. That is
why the Tathagata uses one thing after reflecting, endures another
thing after reflecting, avoids another thing after reflecting, and
removes another thing after reflecting.”</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Anuruddha! The Tathagata has abandoned the taints that defile,
bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to
future birth, ageing, and death; he has cut them off at the root,
made them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are no
longer subject to future arising. Just as a palm tree whose crown is
cut off is incapable of further growth, so too, the Tathagata has
abandoned the taints that defile … cut them off at the root, made
them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are no
longer subject to future arising.</P>
<P  >8.
“What do you think, Anuruddha? What purpose does the Tathagata see
that when a disciple has died, he declares his reappearance thus:
‘So-and-so has reappeared in such-and-such a place; so-and-so has
reappeared in such-and-such a place’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote690anc" HREF="#sdendnote690sym"><SUP>dcxc</SUP></A></SUP>

sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the
Blessed One, have the Blessed One as their resort. It would be good
if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these words. Having
heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Anuruddha, it is not for the purpose of scheming to deceive people
or for the purpose of flattering people or for the purpose of gain,
honour, or renown, or with the thought, ‘Let people know me to be
thus,’ that when a disciple has died, the Tathagata declares his
reappearance thus: ‘So-and-so has reappeared in such-and-such a
place; so-and-so has reappeared in such-and-such a place.’ Rather,
it is because there are faithful clansmen inspired and gladdened by
what is lofty, who when they hear that, direct their minds to such a
state, and that leads to their welfare and happiness for a long time.</P>

70. Kitagiri Sutta - At Kitagiri</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Kasi country together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I abstain from eating at night. By so doing, I am free
from illness and affliction, and I enjoy health, strength, and a
comfortable abiding. Come, bhikkhus, abstain from eating at night. By
so doing, you too will be free from illness and affliction, and you
will enjoy health, strength, and a comfortable abiding.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote696anc" HREF="#sdendnote696sym"><SUP>dcxcvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” they replied.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, as the Blessed One was wandering by stages in the Kasi country,
he eventually arrived at a Kasi town called Kitagiri. There he lived
in this Kasi town, Kitagiri.</P>
<P  >4.
Now on that occasion the bhikkhus named Assaji and Punabbasuka were
residing at Kitagiri.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote697anc" HREF="#sdendnote697sym"><SUP>dcxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then a number of bhikkhus went and told them: “Friends, the Blessed
One and the Sangha of bhikkhus now abstain from eating at night. By
so doing, they are free from illness and affliction, and they enjoy
health, strength, and a comfortable abiding. Come, friends, abstain
from eating at night. By so doing, you too will be free from illness
and affliction, and you will enjoy health, strength, and a
comfortable abiding.” [474] When this was said, the bhikkhus Assaji
and Punabbasuka told those bhikkhus: “Friends, we eat in the
evening, in the morning, and in the day outside the proper time. By
so doing, we are free from illness and affliction, and we enjoy
health, strength, and a comfortable abiding. Why should we abandon [a
benefit] visible here and now to pursue [a benefit to be achieved] at
a future time? We shall eat in the evening, in the morning, and in
the day outside the proper time.”</P>
<P  >5.
Since the bhikkhus were unable to convince the bhikkhus Assaji and
Punabbasuka, they went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to
him, they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurred,
adding: “Venerable sir, since we were unable to convince the
bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka, we have reported this matter to the
Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: “Come,
bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka in my name that the
Teacher calls them.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” he replied, and he went to the bhikkhus Assaji and
Punabbasuka and told them: “The Teacher calls you, friends.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
friend,” they replied, and they went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One then
said: “Bhikkhus, is it true that when a number of bhikkhus went and
told you: ‘Friends, the Blessed One and the Sangha now abstain from
eating at night … Come, friends, abstain from eating at night [475]
… ,’ you told those bhikkhus: ‘Friends, we eat in the evening …
Why should we abandon [a benefit] visible here and now to pursue [a
benefit to be achieved] at a future time? We shall eat in the
evening, in the morning, and in the day outside the proper time’?”
- “Yes, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhus,
have you known me to teach the Dhamma in such a way as this:
‘Whatever this person experiences, whether pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant, unwholesome states diminish in him and
wholesome states increase’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote698anc" HREF="#sdendnote698sym"><SUP>dcxcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
- “No, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Bhikkhus, have you not known me to teach the Dhamma in such a way
as this: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant
feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states
diminish; but when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling,
unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote699anc" HREF="#sdendnote699sym"><SUP>dcxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, when someone feels a certain kind of painful feeling,

states diminish in him and wholesome states increase. Here, when
someone feels a certain kind of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling,

“Bhikkhus, I do not say of all bhikkhus that they still have work
to do with diligence; nor do I say of all bhikkhus that they have no
more work to do with diligence.</P>

“1 say of such bhikkhus who are in higher training, whose minds

“And how does there come to be gradual training, gradual practice,
gradual progress? Here one who has faith [in a teacher] visits him;
when he visits him, he pays respect to him; when he pays respect to

the Dhamma, he memorises it; he examines the meaning of the teachings
he has memorised; when he examines their meaning, he gains a
reflective acceptance of those teachings; when he has gained a
reflective acceptance of those teachings, zeal springs up in him;
when zeal has sprung up, he applies his will; having applied his
will, he scrutinises; having scrutinised, he strives; resolutely

I shall recite it to you, bhikkhus. Try to understand it.”</P>

“Bhikkhus, even with a teacher who is concerned with material
things, an heir to material things, attached to material things, such
haggling [by his disciples] would not be proper: ‘If we get this,
we will do it; if we don’t get this, we won’t do it’; so what
[should be said when the teacher is] the Tathagata, who is utterly
detached from material things?</P>
<P  >27.
“Bhikkhus, for a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the
Teacher’s Dispensation, it is proper that he conduct himself thus:
‘The Blessed One is the Teacher, I am a disciple; the Blessed One
knows, I do not know.’ For a faithful disciple who is intent on
fathoming the Teacher’s Dispensation, the Teacher’s Dispensation
is nourishing and refreshing. For a faithful disciple who is intent
on fathoming the Teacher’s Dispensation, [481] it is proper that he
conduct himself thus: ‘Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and
bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up on my body, but my
energy shall not be relaxed so long as I have not attained what can
be attained by manly strength, manly energy, and manly persistence.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote711anc" HREF="#sdendnote711sym"><SUP>dccxi</SUP></A></SUP>
For a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teacher’s
Dispensation, one of two fruits may be expected: either final
knowledge here and now or, if there is a trace of clinging left,
non-return.”</P>

71. Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta - To Vacchagotta on the<BR>Threefold
True Knowledge</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the wanderer Vacchagotta was staying in the
Wanderers’ Park of the Single White-lotus Mango Tree.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote712anc" HREF="#sdendnote712sym"><SUP>dccxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Vesali for alms. Then the Blessed One
thought: “It is still too early to wander for alms in Vesali.
Suppose I went to the wanderer Vacchagotta in the Wanderers’ Park
of the Single White-lotus Mango Tree.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One went to the wanderer Vacchagotta in the
Wanderers’ Park of the Single White-lotus Mango Tree. The wanderer
Vacchagotta saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and said to
him: “Let the Blessed One come, venerable sir! Welcome to the
Blessed One! It is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to
come here. Let the Blessed One be seated; this seat is ready.” The
Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready, and the wanderer
Vacchagotta [482] took a low seat, sat down at one side, and said to
the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >5.
“Venerable sir, I have heard this: ‘The recluse Gotama claims to
be omniscient and all-seeing, to have complete knowledge and vision
thus: “Whether I am walking or standing or sleeping or awake,
knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to
me.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote713anc" HREF="#sdendnote713sym"><SUP>dccxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
Venerable sir, do those who speak thus say what has been said by the
Blessed One, and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact?
Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that
nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately
deduced from their assertion?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
those who say thus do not say what has been said by me, but
misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote714anc" HREF="#sdendnote714sym"><SUP>dccxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“Venerable sir, how should I answer that I may say what has been
said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is
contrary to fact? How may I explain in accordance with the Dhamma in
such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be
legitimately deduced from my assertion?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
if you answer thus: ‘The recluse Gotama has the threefold true
knowledge,’ you will be saying what has been said by me and will
not misrepresent me with what is contrary to fact. You will explain
in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which
provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from your
assertion.</P>
<P  >7.
“For in so far as I wish, I recollect my manifold past lives, that
is, one birth, two births … (as Sutta 51, §24) … Thus with their
aspects and particulars I recollect my manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >8.
“And in so far as I wish, with the divine eye, which is purified
and surpasses the human, I see beings passing away and reappearing,
inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and
I understand how beings pass on according to their actions … (as
Sutta 51, §25) …</P>
<P  >9.
“And by realising for myself with direct knowledge, I here and now
enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by
wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints.</P>
<P  >10.
“If you answer thus: ‘The recluse Gotama has the threefold true
knowledge,’ [483] you will be saying what has been said by me and
will not misrepresent me with what is contrary to fact. You will
explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing
which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from
your assertion.”</P>
<P  >11.
When this was said, the wanderer Vacchagotta asked the Blessed One:
“Master Gotama, is there any householder who, without abandoning
the fetter of householdership, on the dissolution of the body has
made an end of suffering?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote715anc" HREF="#sdendnote715sym"><SUP>dccxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Master Gotama, is there any householder who, without abandoning
the fetter of householdership, on the dissolution of the body has
gone to heaven?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,

hundred, but far more householders who, without abandoning the fetter
of householdership, on the dissolution of the body have gone to
heaven.”</P>
<P  >13.

<P  >“When
I recollect the past ninety-one aeons, Vaccha, I do not recall any
Ajivaka who, on the dissolution of the body, went to heaven, with one

<P  >“That
being so, Vaccha, this fold of other sectarians is empty even of [a
chance of] going to heaven.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The wanderer Vacchagotta was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading73"  >
72. Aggivacchagotta Sutta - To Vacchagotta on Fire</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One [484] and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >3.
“How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: ‘The
world is eternal: only this is true, anything else is wrong’?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: ‘The world is eternal: only this is true,
anything else is wrong.’“</P>
<P  >4.
“How then, does Master Gotama hold the view: ‘The world is not
eternal: only this is true, anything else is wrong’?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: ‘The world is not eternal: only this is
true, anything else is wrong.’“</P>
<P  >5.
“How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: ‘The
world is finite: only this is true, anything else is wrong’?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: ‘The world is finite: only this is true,
anything else is wrong.’“</P>
<P  >6.
“How then, does Master Gotama hold the view: ‘The world is
infinite: only this is true, anything else is wrong’?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: ‘The world is infinite: only this is true,
anything else is wrong.’“</P>
<P  >7.
“How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: ‘The
soul and the body are the same: only this is true, any thing else is
wrong’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote718anc" HREF="#sdendnote718sym"><SUP>dccxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: ‘The soul and the body are the same: only
this is true, anything else is wrong.’“</P>
<P  >8.
“How then, does Master Gotama hold the view: ‘The soul is one
thing and the body another: only this is true, anything else is
wrong’?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: ‘The soul is one thing and the body
another: only this is true, anything else is wrong.’“</P>
<P  >9.
“How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: ‘After
death a Tathagata exists: only this is true, anything else is
wrong’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote719anc" HREF="#sdendnote719sym"><SUP>dccxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: ‘After death a Tathagata exists: only this
is true, anything else is wrong.’“</P>
<P  >10.
“How then, does Master Gotama hold the view: ‘After death a
Tathagata does not exist: only this is true, anything else is
wrong’?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: ‘After death a Tathagata does not exist:
only this is true, anything else is wrong.’“</P>
<P  >11.
“How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: ‘After
death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist: only this is true,
anything else is wrong.’?’ [485]</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: ‘After death a Tathagata both exists and
does not exist: only this is true, anything else is wrong.’“</P>
<P  >12.
“How then, does Master Gotama hold the view: ‘After death a
Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist: only this is true,
anything else is wrong’?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: ‘After death a Tathagata neither exists nor
does not exist: only this is true, anything else is wrong.’“</P>
<P  >13.
“How is it then, Master Gotama? When Master Gotama is asked each of
these ten questions, he replies: ‘I do not hold that view.’ What
danger does Master Gotama see that he does not take up any of these
speculative views?”</P>
<P  >14.
“Vaccha, the speculative view that the world is eternal is a
thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a
vacillation of views, a fetter of views. It is beset by suffering, by
vexation, by despair, and by fever, and it does not lead to
disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct
knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana.</P>
<P  >“The
speculative view that the world is not eternal … that the world is
finite … that the world is infinite … that the soul and the body
are the same … that the soul is one thing and the body another …
that after death a Tathagata exists [486] … that after death a
Tathagata does not exist … that after death a Tathagata both exists
and does not exist … that after death a Tathagata neither exists
nor does not exist is a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a
contortion of views, a vacillation of views, a fetter of views. It is
beset by suffering, by vexation, by despair, and by fever, and it
does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to
peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. Seeing this
danger, I do not take up any of these speculative views.”</P>
<P  >15.
“Then does Master Gotama hold any speculative view at all?”</P>
<P  >“Vaccha,
‘speculative view’ is something that the Tathagata has put away.
For the Tathagata, Vaccha, has seen<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote720anc" HREF="#sdendnote720sym"><SUP>dccxx</SUP></A></SUP>
this: ‘Such is material form, such its origin, such its
disappearance; such is feeling, such its origin, such its
disappearance; such is perception, such its origin, such its
disappearance; such are formations, such their origin, such their
disappearance; such is consciousness, such its origin, such its
disappearance.’ Therefore, I say, with the destruction, fading
away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of all conceivings, all
excogitations, all I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency
to conceit, the Tathagata is liberated through not clinging.”</P>
<P  >16.
“When a bhikkhu’s mind is liberated thus, Master Gotama, where
does he reappear [after death]?”</P>
<P  >“The
term ‘reappears’ does not apply, Vaccha.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote721anc" HREF="#sdendnote721sym"><SUP>dccxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Then
he does not reappear, Master Gotama?”</P>
<P  >“The
term ‘does not reappear’ does not apply, Vaccha.”</P>
<P  >“Then
he both reappears and does not reappear, Master Gotama?”</P>
<P  >“The
term ‘both reappears and does not reappear’ does not apply,
Vaccha.”</P>
<P  >“Then
he neither reappears nor does not reappear, Master Gotama?”</P>
<P  >“The
term ‘neither reappears nor does not reappear’ does not apply,
Vaccha.”</P>
<P  >17.
“When Master Gotama is asked these four questions, he replies: ‘The
term “reappears” does not apply, Vaccha; the term “does not
reappear” does not apply, Vaccha; the term “both reappears and
does not reappear” does not apply, Vaccha; the term “neither
reappears nor [487] does not reappear” does not apply, Vaccha.’
Here I have fallen into bewilderment, Master Gotama, here I have
fallen into confusion, and the measure of confidence I had gained
through previous conversation with Master Gotama has now
disappeared.”</P>
<P  >18.
“It is enough to cause you bewilderment, Vaccha, enough to cause
you confusion. For this Dhamma, Vaccha, is profound, hard to see and
hard to understand, peaceful and sublime, unattainable by mere
reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by the wise. It is hard for you
to understand it when you hold another view, accept another teaching,
approve of another teaching, pursue a different training, and follow
a different teacher. So I shall question you about this in return,
Vaccha. Answer as you choose.</P>
<P  >19.
“What do you think, Vaccha? Suppose a fire were burning before you.
Would you know: ‘This fire is burning before me’?”</P>
<P  >“I
would, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“If
someone were to ask you, Vaccha: ‘What does this fire burning
before you burn in dependence on?’ - being asked thus, what would
you answer?”</P>
<P  >“Being
asked thus, Master Gotama, I would answer: ‘This fire burning
before me burns in dependence on grass and sticks.’“</P>
<P  >“If
that fire before you were to be extinguished, would you know: ‘This
fire before me has been extinguished’?”</P>
<P  >“I
would, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“If
someone were to ask you, Vaccha: ‘When that fire before you was
extinguished, to which direction did it go: to the east, the west,
the north, or the south?’ - being asked thus, what would you
answer?”</P>
<P  >“That
does not apply, Master Gotama. The fire burned in dependence on its
fuel of grass and sticks. When that is used up, if it does not get
any more fuel, being without fuel, it is reckoned as extinguished.”</P>
<P  >20.
“So too, Vaccha, the Tathagata has abandoned that material form by
which one describing the Tathagata might describe him;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote722anc" HREF="#sdendnote722sym"><SUP>dccxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, done away
with it so that it is no longer subject to future arising. The
Tathagata is liberated from reckoning in terms of material form,
Vaccha, he is profound, immeasurable, unfathomable like the ocean.
The term ‘reappears’ does not apply, the term ‘does not
reappear’ does not apply, [488] the term ‘both reappears and does
not reappear’ does not apply, the term ‘neither reappears nor
does not reappear’ does not apply.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote723anc" HREF="#sdendnote723sym"><SUP>dccxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
The Tathagata has abandoned that feeling by which one describing the
Tathagata might describe him … has abandoned that perception by
which</P>
<P  >one
describing the Tathagata might describe him … has abandoned those
formations by which one describing the Tathagata might describe him …
has abandoned that consciousness by which one describing the
Tathagata might describe him; he has cut it off at the root, made it
like a palm stump, done away with it so that it is no longer subject
to future arising. The Tathagata is liberated from reckoning in terms
of consciousness, Vaccha; he is profound, immeasurable, unfathomable
like the ocean. The term ‘reappears’ does not apply, the term
‘does not reappear’ does not apply, the term ‘both reappears
and does not reappear’ does not apply, the term ‘neither appears
nor does not appear’ does not apply.”</P>
<P  >21.
When this was said, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One:
“Master Gotama, suppose there were a great sala tree not far from a
village or town, and impermanence wore away its branches and foliage,
its bark and sapwood, so that on a later occasion, being divested of
branches and foliage, divested of bark and sapwood, it became pure,
consisting entirely of heartwood; so too, this discourse of Master
Gotama’s is divested of branches and foliage, divested of bark and
sapwood, and is pure, consisting entirely of heartwood.</P>
<P  >22.
“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
[489] for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today
let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
for refuge for life.”</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading74"  >
73. Mahavacchagotta Sutta - The Greater Discourse to Vacchagotta</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >3.
“I have had conversations with Master Gotama for a long time. It
would be good if Master Gotama would teach me in brief the wholesome
and the unwholesome.”</P>
<P  >“I
can teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome in brief, Vaccha, and
I can teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome at length. Still I
will teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome in brief. Listen and
attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir,” he replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >4.
“Vaccha, greed is unwholesome, non-greed is wholesome; hate is
unwholesome, non-hate is wholesome; delusion is unwholesome,
non-delusion is wholesome. In this way three things are unwholesome
and the other three things are wholesome.</P>
<P  >5.
“Killing living beings is unwholesome, abstention from killing
living beings is wholesome; taking what is not given is unwholesome,
abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome; misconduct in
sensual pleasures is unwholesome, abstention from misconduct in
sensual pleasures is wholesome; false speech is unwholesome,
abstention from false speech is wholesome; malicious speech [490] is
unwholesome, abstention from malicious speech is wholesome; harsh
speech is unwholesome, abstention from harsh speech is wholesome;
gossip is unwholesome, abstention from gossip is wholesome;
covetousness is unwholesome, uncovetousness is wholesome; ill will is
unwholesome, non-ill will is wholesome; wrong view is unwholesome,
right view is wholesome. In this way ten things are unwholesome and
the other ten things are wholesome.</P>
<P  >6.
“When a bhikkhu has abandoned craving, cut it off at the root, made
it like a palm stump, done away with it so that it is no longer
subject to future arising, then that bhikkhu is an arahant with
taints destroyed, one who has lived the holy life, done what had to
be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the
fetters of being, and is completely liberated through final
knowledge.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Apart from Master Gotama, is there any one bhikkhu, Master
Gotama’s disciple, who by realising for himself with direct
knowledge here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of

destruction of the taints?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote724anc" HREF="#sdendnote724sym"><SUP>dccxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Apart from Master Gotama and the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, is there
any one man lay follower, Master Gotama’s disciple, clothed in
white leading a life of celibacy who, with the destruction of the

“Master Gotama, if only Master Gotama were accomplished in this

would be deficient in that respect; but because Master Gotama and
bhikkhus are accomplished in this Dhamma, this holy life is thus
complete in that respect. If only Master Gotama and bhikkhus were

“Just as the river Ganges inclines towards the sea, slopes towards
the sea, flows towards the sea, and merges with the sea, so too
Master Gotama’s assembly with its homeless ones and its
householders inclines towards Nibbana, slopes towards Nibbana, flows
towards Nibbana, and merges with Nibbana.</P>
<P  >15.
“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark

refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would
receive the going forth under Master Gotama, I would receive the full
admission.” [494]</P>
<P  >16.
“Vaccha, one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires the
going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline
lives on probation for four months. At the end of four months, if the
bhikkhus are satisfied with him, they give him the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus’ state. But I recognise
individual differences in this matter.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the
going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live
on probation for four months, and if at the end of the four months
the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus’ state, then I will live on
probation for four years. At the end of the four years if the
bhikkhus are satisfied with me, let them give me the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus’ state.”</P>
<P  >17.
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta received the going forth under the
Blessed One, and he received the full admission. Not long after his
full admission, a half-month after his full admission, the venerable
Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him,
he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, I
have attained whatever can be attained by the knowledge of a disciple
in higher training, by the true knowledge of a disciple in higher
training. Let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma further.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote727anc" HREF="#sdendnote727sym"><SUP>dccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >18.
“In that case, Vaccha, develop further two things: serenity and
insight. When these two things are developed further, they will lead
to the penetration of many elements.</P>
<P  >19.
“To the extent that you may wish: ‘May I wield the various kinds
of supernormal power: having been one, may I become many; having been
many, may I become one; may I appear and vanish; may I go unhindered
through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain, as though
through space; may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were
water; may I walk on water without sinking as though it were earth;
seated crosslegged, may I travel in space like a bird; with my hand
may I touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; may I
wield bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-world’ - you will

<P  >20.
“To the extent that you may wish: ‘May I, with the divine ear

kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those that are far as well
as near’ - you will attain the ability to witness any aspect
therein, there being a suitable basis.</P>
<P  >21.
“To the extent that you may wish: ‘May I understand the minds of
other beings, of other persons, having encompassed them with my own

“To the extent that you may wish: ‘May I, with the divine eye,
which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away

beings pass on according to their actions’ - you will attain the
ability to witness any aspect therein, there being a suitable basis.</P>
<P  >24.
“To the extent that you may wish: ‘May I, by realising for myself
with direct knowledge, here and now enter upon and abide in the
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with

witness any aspect therein, there being a suitable basis.”</P>
<P  >25.
Then the venerable Vacchagotta, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to
the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.</P>
<P  >26.
Before long, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and
resolute, the venerable Vacchagotta, by realising for himself with
direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that
supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly
go forth from the home life into homelessness. He directly knew:
“Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be
done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.”
And the venerable Vacchagotta became one of the arahants.</P>
<P  >27.
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were going to see the
Blessed One. The venerable Vacchagotta saw them coming in the
distance. Seeing them, he went to them and asked them: [497] “Where
are the venerable ones going?”</P>
<P  >“We
are going to see the Blessed One, friend.”</P>
<P  >“In
that case, may the venerable ones pay homage in my name with their
heads at the Blessed One’s feet, saying: ‘Venerable sir, the
bhikkhu Vacchagotta pays homage with his head at the Blessed One’s
feet.’ Then say: ‘The Blessed One has been worshipped by me, the
Sublime One has been worshipped by me!”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote729anc" HREF="#sdendnote729sym"><SUP>dccxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Yes,
friend,” those bhikkhus replied. Then they went to the Blessed One,
and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told
the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the venerable Vacchagotta pays
homage with his head at the Blessed One’s feet, and he says: ‘The
Blessed One has been worshipped by me, the Sublime One has been
worshipped by me.’“</P>
<P  >28.
“Bhikkhus, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I already
knew of the bhikkhu Vacchagotta: ‘The bhikkhu Vacchagotta has
attained the threefold true knowledge and has great supernormal power
and might.’ And deities also told me this: ‘The bhikkhu
Vacchagotta has attained the threefold true knowledge and has great
supernormal power and might.’“</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. Those bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading75"  >
74. Dighanakha Sutta - To Dighanakha</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Boar’s Cave on the mountain Vulture Peak.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the wanderer Dighanakha went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote730anc" HREF="#sdendnote730sym"><SUP>dccxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one
side and said to the Blessed One: “Master Gotama, my doctrine and
view is this: ‘Nothing is acceptable to me.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote731anc" HREF="#sdendnote731sym"><SUP>dccxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“This
view of yours, Aggivessana, ‘Nothing is acceptable to me’ - is
not at least that view acceptable to you?”</P>
<P  >“If
this view of mine were acceptable to me, Master Gotama, it too would
be the same, it too [498] would be the same.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote732anc" HREF="#sdendnote732sym"><SUP>dccxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
“Well, Aggivessana, there are plenty in the world who say: ‘It
too would be the same, it too would be the same,’ yet they do not
abandon that view and they take up still some other view. Those are
few in the world who say: ‘It too would be the same, it too would
be the same,’ and who abandon that view and do not take up some
other view.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote733anc" HREF="#sdendnote733sym"><SUP>dccxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
“Aggivessana, there are some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine
and view is this: ‘Everything is acceptable to me.’ There are
some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘Nothing
is acceptable to me.’ And there are some recluses and brahmins
whose doctrine and view is this: ‘Something is acceptable to me,
something is not acceptable to me.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote734anc" HREF="#sdendnote734sym"><SUP>dccxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Among these, the view of those recluses and brahmins who hold the
doctrine and view ‘Everything is acceptable to me’ is close to
lust, close to bondage, close to delighting, close to holding, close
to clinging. The view of those recluses and brahmins who hold the
doctrine and view ‘Nothing is acceptable to me’ is close to
non-lust, close to non-bondage, close to non-delighting, close to
non-holding, close to non-clinging.”</P>
<P  >5.
When this was said, the wanderer Dighanakha remarked: “Master
Gotama commends my point of view, Master Gotama recommends my point
of view.”</P>
<P  >“Aggivessana,
as to those recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine and view
‘Something is acceptable to me, something is not acceptable to me’
- the view of theirs as to what is acceptable is close to lust, close
to bondage, close to delighting, close to holding, close to clinging,
while the view of theirs as to what is not acceptable is close to
non-lust, close to non-bondage, close to non-delighting, close to
non-holding, close to non-clinging.</P>
<P  >6.
“Now, Aggivessana, a wise man among those recluses and brahmins who
hold the doctrine and view ‘Everything is acceptable to me’
considers thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote735anc" HREF="#sdendnote735sym"><SUP>dccxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
‘If I obstinately adhere to my view “Everything is acceptable to
me” and declare: “Only this is true, anything else is wrong,”
then I may clash with the two others: with a recluse or brahmin who
holds the doctrine [499] and view “Nothing is acceptable to me”
and with a recluse or brahmin who holds the doctrine and view
“Something is acceptable to me, something is not acceptable to me.”
I may clash with these two, and when there is a clash, there are
disputes; when there are disputes, there are quarrels; when there are
quarrels, there is vexation.’ Foreseeing for himself clashes,
disputes, quarrels, and vexation, he abandons that view and does not
take up some other view. This is how there comes to be the abandoning
of these views; this is how there comes to be the relinquishing of
these views.</P>

<P  >9.
“Now, Aggivessana,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote736anc" HREF="#sdendnote736sym"><SUP>dccxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
this body made of material form, consisting of the four great
elements, procreated by a mother and father, and built up out of
boiled rice and porridge, is subject to impermanence, to being worn
and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration. It should be
regarded as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a tumour, as
a dart, as a calamity, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating,
as void, as not self. When one regards this body thus, one abandons
desire for the body, affection for the body, subservience to the
body.</P>
<P  >10.
“There are, Aggivessana, three kinds of feeling: pleasant feeling,
painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. On the
occasion when one feels pleasant feeling, one does not feel painful
feeling or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling; on that occasion one
feels only pleasant feeling. On the occasion when one feels painful
feeling, one does not feel pleasant feeling or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling; on that occasion one feels only
painful feeling. On the occasion when one feels
neitherpainful-nor-pleasant feeling, one does not feel pleasant
feeling or painful feeling; on that occasion one feels only
neitherpainful-nor-pleasant feeling.</P>
<P  >11.
“Pleasant feeling, Aggivessana, is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away,
and ceasing. Painful feeling too is impermanent, conditioned,
dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away,
and ceasing. Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling too is impermanent,
conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, vanishing,
fading away, and ceasing.</P>
<P  >12.
“Seeing thus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes disenchanted
with pleasant feeling, disenchanted with painful feeling,
disenchanted with neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Being
disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion [his mind]
is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It
is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’</P>
<P  >13.
“A bhikkhu whose mind is liberated thus, Aggivessana, sides with
none and disputes with none; he employs the speech currently used in
the world without adhering to it.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote737anc" HREF="#sdendnote737sym"><SUP>dccxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was standing behind the
Blessed One, [501] fanning him. Then he thought: “The Blessed One,
indeed, speaks of the abandoning of these things through direct
knowledge; the Sublime One, indeed, speaks of the relinquishing of
these things through direct knowledge.” As the venerable Sariputta
considered this, through not clinging his mind was liberated from the
taints.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote738anc" HREF="#sdendnote738sym"><SUP>dccxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
But in the wanderer Dighanakha the spotless immaculate vision of the
Dhamma arose: “All that is subject to arising is subject to
cessation.” The wanderer Dighanakha saw the Dhamma, attained the
Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma; he crossed beyond
doubt, did away with perplexity, gained intrepidity, and became
independent of others in the Teacher’s Dispensation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote739anc" HREF="#sdendnote739sym"><SUP>dccxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >16.
Then he said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama!
Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear
in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been
overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was
lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see
forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the
Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay
follower who has gone to him for refuge for life.”</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading76"  >
75. Magandiya Sutta - To Magandiya</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Kuru country at a town of the Kurus named Kammasadhamma, on a spread
of grass in the fire chamber of a brahmin belonging to the Bharadvaja
clan.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Kammasadhamma for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Kammasadhamma and had returned from his
almsround, after his meal he went to a certain grove for the day’s
abiding. Having entered the grove, he sat down at the root of a tree
for the day’s abiding. [502]</P>
<P  >3.
Then the wanderer Magandiya, while walking and wandering for
exercise, went to the fire chamber of the brahmin belonging to the
Bharadvaja clan. There he saw a spread of grass prepared and asked
the brahmin: “For whom has this spread of grass been prepared in
Master Bharadvaja’s fire chamber? It seems like a recluse’s bed.”</P>
<P  >4.
“Master Magandiya, there is the recluse Gotama, the son of the
Sakyans, who went forth from a Sakyan clan. Now a good report of
Master Gotama has been spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’ This
bed has been prepared for that Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >5.
“Indeed, Master Bharadvaja, it is an ill sight we see when we see
the bed of that destroyer of growth,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote740anc" HREF="#sdendnote740sym"><SUP>dccxl</SUP></A></SUP>
Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“Be
careful what you say, Magandiya, be careful what you say! Many
learned nobles, learned brahmins, learned householders, and learned
recluses have full confidence in Master</P>
<P  >Gotama,
and have been disciplined by him in the noble true way, in the Dhamma
that is wholesome.”</P>
<P  >“Master
Bharadvaja, even if we saw that Master Gotama face to face, we would
tell him to his face: ‘The recluse Gotama is a destroyer of
growth.’ Why is that? Because that is recorded in our scriptures.”</P>
<P  >“If
Master Magandiya has no objection, may I tell this to Master Gotama?”</P>
<P  >“Let
Master Bharadvaja be at ease. Tell him just what I have said.”</P>
<P  >6.
Meanwhile, with the divine ear, which is purified and surpasses the
human, the Blessed One heard this conversation between the brahmin of
the Bharadvaja clan and the wanderer Magandiya. Then, when it was
evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation, went to the brahmin’s
fire chamber, and sat down on the spread of grass made ready. Then
the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One asked him:
“Bharadvaja, did you have any conversation with the wanderer
Magandiya [503] about this spread of grass?”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin, awestruck and with his hair standing on
end, replied: “We wanted to tell Master Gotama about that very
thing, but Master Gotama has anticipated us.”</P>
<P  >7.
But this discussion between the Blessed One and the Brahmin of the
Bharadvaja clan was left unfinished, for then the wanderer Magandiya,
while walking and wandering for exercise, came to the brahmin’s
fire chamber and went up to the Blessed One. He exchanged greetings
with the Blessed One, and when this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One said to him:</P>
<P  >8.
“Magandiya, the eye delights in forms, takes delight in forms,
rejoices in forms; that has been tamed by the Tathagata, guarded,
protected, and restrained, and he teaches the Dhamma for its
restraint. Was it with reference to this that you said: ‘The
recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth’?”</P>
<P  >“It
was with reference to this, Master Gotama, that I said: ‘The
recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth.’ Why is that? Because that
is recorded in our scriptures.”</P>
<P  >“The
ear delights in sound … The nose delights in odours … The tongue
delights in flavours … The body delights in tangibles … The mind
delights in mind-objects, takes delight in mind-objects, rejoices in
mind-objects; that has been tamed by the Tathagata, guarded,
protected, and restrained, and he teaches the Dhamma for its
restraint. Was it with reference to this that you said: ‘The
recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth’?”</P>
<P  >“It
was with reference to this, Master Gotama, that I said: ‘The
recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth.’ Why is that? Because that
is recorded in our scriptures.”</P>
<P  >9.
“What do you think, Magandiya? Here someone [504] may have formerly
enjoyed himself with forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. On a later occasion, having understood as they
actually are the origin, the disappearance, the gratification, the
danger, and the escape in the case of forms, he might abandon craving
for forms, remove fever for forms, and abide without thirst, with a
mind inwardly at peace. What would you say to him, Magandiya?” -
“Nothing, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“What

himself with sounds cognizable by the ear … with odours cognizable

the tongue … with tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished
for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire
and provocative of lust. I had three palaces, one for the rainy
season, one for the winter, and one for the summer. I lived in the
rains’ palace for the four months of the rainy season, enjoying
myself with musicians who were all female, and I did not go down to
the lower palace.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote741anc" HREF="#sdendnote741sym"><SUP>dccxli</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“On
a later occasion, having understood as they actually are the origin,
the disappearance, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in
the case of sensual pleasures, I abandoned craving for sensual
pleasures, I removed fever for sensual pleasures, and I abide without

free from lust for sensual pleasures being devoured by craving for
sensual pleasures, burning with fever for sensual pleasures,
indulging in sensual pleasures, and I do not envy them, nor do I
delight therein. Why is that? Because there is, Magandiya, a delight
apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, [505]
which surpasses divine bliss.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote742anc" HREF="#sdendnote742sym"><SUP>dccxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
Since I take delight in that, I do not envy what is inferior, nor do

<P  >11.
“Suppose, Magandiya, a householder or a householder’s son was
rich, with great wealth and property, and being provided and endowed
with the five cords of sensual pleasure, he might enjoy himself with
forms cognizable by the eye … with sounds cognizable by the ear …
with odours cognizable by the nose … with flavours cognizable by
the tongue … with tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished
for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire
and provocative of lust. Having conducted himself well in body,
speech, and mind, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he
might reappear in a happy destination, in the heavenly world in the
retinue of the gods of the Thirty-three; and there, surrounded by a
group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove, he would enjoy himself,
provided and endowed with the five cords of divine sensual pleasure.
Suppose he saw a householder or a householder’s son enjoying
himself, provided and endowed with the five cords of [human] sensual
pleasure. What do you think, Magandiya? Would that young god
surrounded by the group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove, enjoying
himself, provided and endowed with the five cords of divine sensual
pleasure, envy the householder or the householder’s son for the
five cords of human sensual pleasure or would he return to human
sensual pleasures?”</P>
<P  >“No,
Master Gotama. Why not? Because heavenly sensual pleasures are more
excellent and sublime than human sensual pleasures.”</P>
<P  >12.
“So too, Magandiya, formerly when I lived the home life, I enjoyed
myself, provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure:
with forms cognizable by the eye … with tangibles cognizable by the
body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected

“Suppose, Magandiya, there was a leper with sores and blisters on
his limbs, being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the
openings of his wounds with his nails, cauterising his body over a
burning charcoal pit. Then his friends and companions, his kinsmen
and relatives, would bring a physician to treat him. The physician
would make medicine for him, and by means of that medicine the man

his burning charcoal pit or his use of medicine?”</P>
<P  >“No,
Master Gotama. Why is that? Because when there is sickness, medicine
has to be made, and when there is no sickness medicine does not have

<P  >“Yes,

touch, hot, and scorching.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, Magandiya? Is it only now that that fire is painful to

<P  >“Master
Gotama, that fire is now painful to touch, hot, and scorching, and
previously too that fire was painful to touch, hot, and scorching.
For when that man was a leper with sores and blisters on his limbs,
being devoured by worms, scratching the scabs off the openings of his
wounds with his nails, his faculties were impaired; thus, though the
fire was actually painful to touch, he mistakenly perceived it as
pleasant.”</P>
<P  >16.
“So too, Magandiya, in the past sensual pleasures were painful to
touch, hot, and scorching; in the future sensual pleasures will be
painful to touch, hot, and scorching; and now at present sensual
pleasures are painful to touch, hot, and scorching. But these beings
who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures, who are devoured by
craving for sensual pleasures, who burn with fever for sensual

his body, [508] the fouler, more evilsmelling and more infected the
openings of his wounds would become, yet he would find a certain
measure of satisfaction and enjoyment in scratching the openings of
his wounds. So too, Magandiya, beings who are not free from lust for
sensual pleasures, who are devoured by craving for sensual pleasures,
who burn with fever for sensual pleasures, still indulge in sensual</P>
<P  >pleasures;
the more such beings indulge in sensual pleasures, the more their
craving for sensual pleasures increases and the more they are burned
by their fever for sensual pleasures, yet they find a certain measure
of satisfaction and enjoyment in dependence on the five cords of
sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >18.
“What do you think, Magandiya? Have you ever seen or heard of a
king or a king’s minister enjoying himself, provided and endowed
with the five cords of sensual pleasure who, without abandoning
craving for sensual pleasures, without removing fever for sensual

recluses or brahmins who abided or abide or will abide free from
thirst, with a mind inwardly at peace, all do so after having

Then at that point the Blessed One uttered this exclamation:</P>
<P >
“The greatest of all gains is health,</P>

<P  >When

‘The greatest of all gains is health,</P>

Nibbana is the greatest bliss.’</P>

Nibbana?”</P>

the stars or the sun and moon. He might hear a man with good eyesight
saying: ‘Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless,
and clean!’ and he would go in search of a white cloth. Then a man
would cheat him with a dirty soiled garment thus: ‘Good man, here
is a white cloth for you, beautiful, spotless, and clean.’ And he
would accept it and put it on, and being satisfied with it, he would
utter words of satisfaction thus: ‘Good indeed, sirs, is a white
cloth, beautiful, spotless, and clean!’ What do you think,
Magandiya? When that man born blind accepted that dirty soiled
garment, put it on, and being satisfied with it, uttered words of
satisfaction thus: ‘Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful,
spotless, and clean!’ - did he do so knowing and seeing, or out of
faith in the man with good eyesight?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, he would have done so unknowing and unseeing, [510] out of faith
in the man with good eyesight.”</P>
<P  >21.
“So too, Magandiya, the wanderers of other sects are blind and
visionless. They do not know health, they do not see Nibbana, yet
they utter this stanza thus:</P>
<P >
‘The greatest of all gains is health,</P>
<P >
Nibbana is the greatest bliss.’</P>
<P  >This
stanza was uttered by the earlier Accomplished Ones, Fully
Enlightened Ones, thus:</P>
<P >
‘The greatest of all gains is health,</P>
<P >
Nibbana is the greatest bliss,</P>
<P >
The eightfold path is the best of paths</P>
<P >
For it leads safely to the Deathless.’</P>
<P  >Now
it has gradually become current among ordinary people.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote745anc" HREF="#sdendnote745sym"><SUP>dccxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
And although this body, Magandiya, is a disease, a tumour, a dart, a
calamity, and an affliction, referring to this body you say: ‘This
is that health, Master Gotama, this is that Nibbana.’ You do not
have that noble vision, Magandiya, by means of which you might know
health and see Nibbana.”</P>
<P  >22.
“I have confidence in Master Gotama thus: ‘Master Gotama is
capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can come to
know health and to see Nibbana.’“</P>
<P  >“Magandiya,
suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light
forms … or the sun and moon. Then his friends and companions, his
kinsmen and relatives, would bring a physician to treat him. The
physician would make a medicine for him, yet by means of that
medicine the man’s vision would not arise or be purified. What do
you think, Magandiya, would that doctor reap weariness and
disappointment?” - “Yes, Master Gotama.” - “So too,
Magandiya, if I were to teach you the Dhamma thus: ‘This is that
health, this is that Nibbana,’ you might not know health or see
Nibbana, and that would be wearisome and troublesome for me.” [511]</P>
<P  >23.
“I have confidence in Master Gotama thus: ‘Master Gotama is
capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I can come to

<P  >“Magandiya,
suppose there was a man born blind who could not see dark and light

saying: ‘Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless,

is a white cloth for you, beautiful, spotless, and clean.’ And he
would accept it and put it on. Then his friends and companions, his
kinsmen and relatives, would bring a physician to treat him. The
physician would make medicine - emetics and purgatives, ointments and
counter-ointments and nasal treatment - and by means of that medicine
the man’s vision would arise and be purified. Together with the
arising of his vision, his desire and liking for that dirty soiled
garment would be abandoned; then he might burn with indignation and
enmity towards that man and might think that he ought to be killed
thus: ‘Indeed, I have long been tricked, cheated, and defrauded by
this man with this dirty soiled garment when he told me: “Good man,
here is a white cloth for you, beautiful, spotless, and clean.’“</P>
<P  >24.
“So too, Magandiya, if I were to teach you the Dhamma thus: ‘This
is that health, this is that Nibbana,’ you might know health and
see Nibbana. Together with the arising of your vision, your desire
and lust for the five aggregates affected by clinging might be
abandoned. Then perhaps you might think: ‘Indeed, I have long been
tricked, cheated, and defrauded by this mind. For when clinging, I
have been clinging just to material form, I have been clinging just
to feeling, I have been clinging just to perception, I have been
clinging just to formations, I have been clinging just to
consciousness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote746anc" HREF="#sdendnote746sym"><SUP>dccxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
With my clinging as condition, being [comes to be]; with being as
condition, birth; with birth as condition, ageing and death, sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, [512] and despair come to be. Such is the
origin of this whole mass of suffering.’“</P>
<P  >25.
“1 have confidence in Master Gotama thus: ‘Master Gotama is
capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I might rise up
from this seat cured of my blindness.’“</P>
<P  >“Then,
Magandiya, associate with true men. When you associate with true men,
you will hear the true Dhamma. When you hear the true Dhamma, you
will practise in accordance with the true Dhamma. When you practise
in accordance with the true Dhamma, you will know and see for
yourself thus: ‘These are diseases, tumours, and darts; but here
these diseases, tumours, and darts cease without remainder.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote747anc" HREF="#sdendnote747sym"><SUP>dccxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
With the cessation of my clinging comes cessation of being; with the
cessation of being, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth,
ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair
cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.’“</P>
<P  >26.
When this was said, the wanderer Magandiya said: “Magnificent,
Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the
Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had
been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one
who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with
eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the
Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would receive the going forth
under Master Gotama. I would receive the full admission.”</P>
<P  >27.
“Magandiya, one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires
the going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline
lives on probation for four months. At the end of four months, if the
bhikkhus are satisfied with him, they give him the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus’ state. But I recognise
individual differences in this matter.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the
going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live
on probation for four months, and if at the end of the four months
the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus’ state, then I will live on
probation for four years. At the end of the four years if the
bhikkhus are satisfied with me, let them give me the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus’ state.” [513]</P>
<P  >28.
Then the wanderer Magandiya received the going forth under the
Blessed One, and he received the full admission. And soon, not long
after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent,
ardent, and resolute, the venerable Magandiya, by realising for
himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided
in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen
rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. He directly
knew: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had
to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of
being.” And the venerable Magandiya became one of the arahants.</P>

76. Sandaka Sutta - To Sandaka</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Kosambi in Ghosita’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the wanderer Sandaka was staying in the
Pilakkha-tree Cave with a large assembly of wanderers.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Ananda rose from meditation
and addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Come, friends, let us go to the
Devakata Pool to see the cave.” - “Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus
replied. Then the venerable Ananda went to the Devakata Pool together
with a number of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >4.
Now on that occasion the wanderer Sandaka was seated with a large
assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar, loudly and noisily
talking many kinds of pointless talk,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote748anc" HREF="#sdendnote748sym"><SUP>dccxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
such as talk of kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, battles,
food, drink, clothing, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, vehicles,
villages, towns, cities, countries, women, heroes, streets, wells,
the dead, trifles, the origin of the world, the origin of the sea,
[514] whether things are so or are not so. Then the wanderer Sandaka
saw the venerable Ananda coming in the distance. Seeing him, he
quieted his own assembly thus: “Sirs, be quiet; sirs, make no
noise. Here comes the recluse Ananda, a disciple of the recluse
Gotama, one of the recluse Gotama’s disciples staying in Kosambi.
These venerable ones like quiet; they are disciplined in quiet; they
commend quiet. Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one, he will
think to join us.” Then the wanderers became silent.</P>
<P  >5.
The venerable Ananda went to the wanderer Sandaka who said to him:
“Let Master Ananda come! Welcome to Master Ananda! It is long since
Master Ananda found an opportunity to come here. Let Master Ananda be
seated; this seat is ready.”</P>
<P  >The
venerable Ananda sat down on the seat made ready, and the wanderer
Sandaka took a low seat and sat down at one side. When he had done
so, the venerable Ananda asked him: “For what discussion are you
sitting together here now, Sandaka? And what was your discussion that
was left unfinished?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Ananda, let be the discussion for which we are now sitting together
here. Master Ananda can well hear about it later. It would be good if
Master Ananda would give a talk on his own teacher’s Dhamma.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
Sandaka, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir,” he replied. The venerable Ananda said this:</P>
<P  >6.
“Sandaka, these four ways that negate the living of the holy life
have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened, and also these four kinds of holy
life without consolation have been declared, wherein a wise man
certainly would not live the holy life, or if he should live it,
would not attain the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote749anc" HREF="#sdendnote749sym"><SUP>dccxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“But,
Master Ananda, what are those four ways that negate the living of the

certainly would not live the holy life, or if he should live it,
would not attain the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome?”</P>
<P  >7.
“Here, Sandaka, some teacher holds such a doctrine and view as
this: ‘There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed;
no fruit or result of good and bad actions; no this world, no other
world; no mother, no father; no beings who are reborn spontaneously;
no good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have
themselves realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and
the other world. A person consists of the four great elements.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote750anc" HREF="#sdendnote750sym"><SUP>dccl</SUP></A></SUP>
When he dies, earth returns and goes back to the body of earth, water
returns and goes back to the body of water, fire returns and goes
back to the body of fire, air returns and goes back to the body of
air; the faculties are transferred to space. [Four] men with the bier
as fifth carry away the corpse. The funeral orations last as far as
the charnel ground; the bones whiten; burnt offerings end with ashes.
Giving is a doctrine of fools. When anyone asserts the doctrine that
there is [giving and the like], it is empty, false prattle. Fools and
the wise are alike cut off and annihilated with the dissolution of
the body; after death they do not exist.’</P>
<P  >8.
“About this a wise man considers thus: ‘This good teacher holds

and to pull out his hair and beard, since I, who live in a house
crowded with children, who use Benares sandalwood, who wear garlands,
scents, and unguents, and accept gold and silver, shall reap exactly
the same destination, the same future course, as this good teacher.

when one oppresses or makes others inflict oppression, when one
intimidates or makes others inflict intimidation, when one kills
living beings, takes what is not given, breaks into houses, plunders
wealth, commits burglary, ambushes highways, seduces another’s
wife, utters falsehood - no evil is done by the doer. If, with a
razor-rimmed wheel, one were to make the living beings on this earth
into one mass of flesh, into one heap of flesh, because of this there
would be no evil and no outcome of evil. If one were to go along the
south bank of the Ganges killing and slaughtering, mutilating and
making others mutilate, torturing and making others inflict torture,
because of this there would be no evil and no outcome of evil. If one
were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving gifts and making
others give gifts, making offerings and making others make offerings,

and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. A wise man
certainly would live the holy life with a teacher under whom a
disciple attains such a lofty distinction …</P>
<P  >48.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 51, §25) … Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions. A wise man certainly would live the holy
life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains such a lofty
distinction …</P>
<P  >49.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. He understands as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’
… (as Sutta 51, §26) … He understands as it actually is: ‘This
is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.’</P>
<P  >50.
“When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It is
liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’ A wise man certainly would live the
holy life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains such a lofty
distinction, and while living it he would attain the true way, the
Dhamma that is wholesome.”</P>
<P  >51.
“But, Master Ananda, when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints
destroyed, one who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done,
laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of
being, and is completely liberated through final knowledge, [523]
could he enjoy sensual pleasures?”</P>
<P  >“Sandaka,
when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed … and is
completely liberated through final knowledge, he is incapable of
transgression in five cases. A bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is
incapable of deliberately depriving a living being of life; he is
incapable of taking what is not given, that is, of stealing; he is
incapable of indulging in sexual intercourse; he is incapable of
knowingly speaking falsehood; he is incapable of enjoying sensual
pleasures by storing them up as he did formerly in lay life.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote756anc" HREF="#sdendnote756sym"><SUP>dcclvi</SUP></A></SUP>
When a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed … he is
incapable of transgression in these five cases.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote757anc" HREF="#sdendnote757sym"><SUP>dcclvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >52.
“But, Master Ananda, when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints
destroyed … is his knowledge and vision that his taints are
destroyed continuously and uninterruptedly present to him whether he
is walking or standing or sleeping or awake?”</P>
<P  >“As
to that, Sandaka, I shall give you a simile, for some wise men here
understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile. Suppose a
man’s hands and feet were cut off. Would he know ‘My hands and
feet are cut off’ continuously and uninterruptedly, whether he is
walking or standing or sleeping or awake, or would he know ‘My
hands and feet are cut off’ only when he reviews this fact?”</P>
<P  >“The
man, Master Ananda, would not know ‘My hands and feet are cut off’
continuously and uninterruptedly; rather, he would know ‘My hands
and feet are cut off’ only when he reviews this fact.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, Sandaka, when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed …
his knowledge and vision that his taints are destroyed is not
continuously and uninterruptedly present to him whether he is walking
or standing or sleeping or awake; rather, he knows ‘My taints are
destroyed’ only when he reviews this fact.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote758anc" HREF="#sdendnote758sym"><SUP>dcclviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >53.
“How many emancipated ones<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote759anc" HREF="#sdendnote759sym"><SUP>dcclix</SUP></A></SUP>
are there in this Dhamma and Discipline, Master Ananda?”</P>
<P  >“There
are not only one hundred, Sandaka, or two hundred, three hundred,
four hundred or five hundred, but far more emancipated ones than that
in this Dhamma and Discipline.”</P>
<P  >“It
is wonderful, Master Ananda, it is marvellous! There is no lauding of
one’s own Dhamma and no disparaging of the Dhamma of others; there
is the teaching of the Dhamma in its full range, [524] and so many
emancipated ones appear. But these Ajivakas, those mothers’ dead
sons, laud themselves and disparage others, and they recognise only
three emancipated ones, namely, Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sankicca, and
Makkhali Gosala.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote760anc" HREF="#sdendnote760sym"><SUP>dcclx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >54.
Then the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own assembly: “Go, sirs.
The holy life is to be lived under the recluse Gotama. It is not easy
for us now to give up gain, honour, and renown.”</P>
<P  >That
is how the wanderer Sandaka exhorted his own assembly to live the
holy life under the Blessed One.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading78"  >
77.Mahasakuludayi Sutta - The Greater Discourse<BR>to Sakuludayin</H2>
<P  >[1]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a number of well-known wanderers were staying at
the Peacocks’ Sanctuary, the wanderers’ park - that is,
Annabhara, Varadhara, and the wanderer Sakuludayin, as well as other
well-known wanderers.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Rajagaha for alms. Then he thought:
“It is still too early to wander for alms in Rajagaha. Suppose I
went to the wanderer Sakuludayin in the Peacocks’ Sanctuary, the
wanderers’ park.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One when to the Peacocks’ Sanctuary, the
wanderers’ park. Now on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was
seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar,
loudly and noisily talking many kinds of pointless talk, such as talk
of kings … (as Sutta 76, §4) [2] … whether things are so or are
not so. Then the wanderer Sakuludayin saw the Blessed One coming in
the distance. Seeing him, he quieted his own assembly thus: “Sirs,
be quiet; sirs, make no noise. Here comes the recluse Gotama. This
venerable one likes quiet and commends quiet. Perhaps if he finds our
assembly a quiet one, he will think to join us.” Then the wanderers
became silent.</P>
<P  >5.
The Blessed One went to the wanderer Sakuludayin, who said to him:
“Let the Blessed One come, venerable sir! Welcome to the Blessed
One! It is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to come
here. Let the Blessed One be seated; this seat is ready.”</P>
<P  >The
Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready, and the wanderer
Sakuludayin took a low seat and sat down at one side.</P>
<P  >When
he had done so, the Blessed One asked him: “For what discussion are
you sitting together here now, Udayin? And what was your discussion
that was interrupted?”</P>
<P  >6.
“Venerable sir, let be the discussion for which we are now sitting
together here. The Blessed One can well hear about it later. In
recent days, venerable sir, when recluses and brahmins of various
sects have been gathering together and sitting together in the
debating hall, this topic has arisen: ‘It is a gain for the people
of Anga and Magadha, it is a great gain for the people of Anga and
Magadha that these recluses and brahmins, heads of orders, heads of
groups, teachers of groups, well-known and famous founders of sects
regarded by many as saints, have come to spend the Rains at Rajagaha.
There is this Purana Kassapa, the head of an order, the head of a
group, the teacher of a group, the well-known and famous founder of a
sect regarded by many as a saint: he has come to spend the Rains at
Rajagaha. There is also this Makkhali Gosala … this Ajita
Kesakambalin … this Pakudha Kaccayana … this Sanjaya
Belatthiputta … this Nigantha Nataputta, the head of an order, the
head of a group, the teacher of a group, [3] the well-known and
famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint: he too has come
to spend the Rains at Rajagaha. There is also this recluse Gotama,
the head of an order, the head of a group, the teacher of a group,
the wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a
saint: he too has come to spend the Rains at Rajagaha. Now among
these worthy recluses and brahmins, heads of orders … regarded by
many as saints, who is honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by
his disciples? And how, honouring and respecting him, do they live in
dependence on him?’</P>
<P  >“Thereupon
some said this: ‘This Purana Kassapa is the head of an order …
regarded by many as a saint, yet he is not honoured, respected,
revered, and venerated by his disciples, nor do his disciples live in
dependence on him, honouring and respecting him. Once Purana Kassapa
was teaching his Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers.
Then a certain disciple of his made a noise thus: “Sirs, do not ask
Purana Kassapa this question. He does not know that. We know that.
Ask us that question. We will answer that for you, sirs.” It
happened that Purana Kassapa did not get his way, though he waved his
arms and wailed: “Be quiet, sirs, make no noise, sirs. They are not
asking you, sirs. They are asking us. We will answer them.” Indeed,
many of his disciples left him after refuting his doctrine thus: “You
do not understand this Dhamma and Discipline. I understand this
Dhamma and Discipline. How could you understand this Dhamma and
Discipline? Your way is wrong. My way is right. I am consistent. You
are inconsistent. What should have been said first, you said last.
What should have been said last, you said first. What you had so
carefully thought up has been turned inside out. Your doctrine is
refuted. You are proved wrong. Go and learn better, or disentangle
yourself if you can!” Thus Purana Kassapa is not honoured,
respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples, nor do his
disciples live in dependence on him, honouring and respecting him.
Indeed, he is scorned by the scorn shown to his Dhamma.’ [4]</P>
<P  >“And
some said this: ‘This Makkhali Gosala … this Ajita Kesakambalin …
this Pakudha Kaccayana … this Sanjaya Belatthiputta … this
Nigantha Nataputta is the head of an order … [but he] is not
honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples, nor do
his disciples live in dependence on him, honouring and respecting
him. Indeed, he is scorned by the scorn shown to his Dhamma.’</P>
<P  >“And
some said this: ‘This recluse Gotama is the head of an order, the
head of a group, the teacher of a group, the wellknown and famous
founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint. He is honoured,
respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples, and his disciples
live in dependence on him, honouring and respecting him. Once the
recluse Gotama was teaching his Dhamma to an assembly of several
hundred followers and there a certain disciple of his cleared his
throat. Thereupon one of his companions in the holy life nudged him
with his knee [to indicate]: [5] “Be quiet, venerable sir, make no
noise; the Blessed One, the Teacher, is teaching us the Dhamma.”
When the recluse Gotama is teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of
several hundred followers, on that occasion there is no sound of his
disciples’ coughing or clearing their throats. For then that large
assembly is poised in expectancy: “Let us hear the Dhamma the
Blessed One is about to teach.” Just as though a man were at a
crossroads pressing out pure honey and a large group of people were
poised in expectancy, so too, when the recluse Gotama is teaching the
Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers, on that occasion
there is no sound of his disciples’ coughing or clearing their
throats. For then that large assembly is poised in expectancy: “Let
us hear the Dhamma the Blessed One is about to teach.” And even
those disciples of his who fall out with their companions in the holy
life and abandon the training to return to the low life - even they
praise the Master and the Dhamma and the Sangha; they blame
themselves instead of others, saying: “We were unlucky, we have
little merit; for though we went forth into homelessness in such a
well-proclaimed Dhamma, we were unable to live the perfect and pure
holy life for the rest of our lives.” Having become monastery
attendants or lay followers, they undertake and observe the five
precepts. Thus the recluse Gotama is honoured, respected, revered,
and venerated by his disciples, and his disciples live in dependence
on him, honouring and respecting him.’“</P>
<P  >7.
“But, Udayin, how many qualities do you see in me because of which
my disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in
dependence on me, honouring and respecting me?”</P>
<P  >8.
“Venerable sir, I see five qualities in the Blessed One because of
which his disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate him, and
live in dependence on him, honouring and respecting him. What are the
five? First, venerable sir, the Blessed One eats little and commends
eating little; this I see as the first quality of the Blessed One
because of which his disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate
him, and live in dependence on him, honouring and respecting him. [6]
Again, venerable sir, the Blessed One is content with any kind of
robe and commends contentment with any kind of robe; this I see as
the second quality of the Blessed One … Again, venerable sir, the
Blessed One is content with any kind of almsfood and commends
contentment with any kind of almsfood; this I see as the third
quality of the Blessed One … Again, venerable sir, the Blessed One
is content with any kind of resting place and commends contentment
with any kind of resting place; this I see as the fourth quality of
the Blessed One … Again, venerable sir, the Blessed One is secluded
and commends seclusion; this I see as the fifth quality of the
Blessed One … Venerable sir, these are the five qualities I see in
the Blessed One because of which his disciples honour, respect,
revere, and venerate him, and live in dependence on him, honouring
and respecting him.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Suppose, Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and
venerated me, and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting
me, with the thought: ‘The recluse Gotama eats little and commends
eating little.’ Now there are disciples of mine who live on a
cupful or half a cupful of food, a bilva fruit’s or half a bilva
fruit’s quantity of food, [7] while I sometimes eat the full
contents of my almsbowl or even more. So if my disciples honoured
me-with the thought: ‘The recluse Gotama eats little and commends
eating little,’ then those disciples of mine who live on a cupful
of food … should not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for
this quality, nor should they live in dependence on me, honouring and
respecting me.</P>
<P  >“Suppose,
Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me,
and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the
thought: ‘The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe and
commends contentment with any kind of robe.’ Now there are
disciples of mine who are refuse-rag wearers, wearers of coarse
robes; they collect rags from the charnel ground, rubbish heaps, or
shops, make them into patched robes, and wear them. But I sometimes
wear robes given by householders, robes so fine that pumpkin hair is
coarse in comparison. So if my disciples honoured me … with the
thought: ‘The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe and
commends contentment with any kind of robe,’ then those disciples
of mine who are refuse-rag wearers, wearers of coarse robes …
should not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality,
nor should they live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting
me.</P>
<P  >“Suppose,
Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me,
and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the
thought: ‘The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of almsfood
and commends contentment with any kind of almsfood.’ Now there are
disciples of mine who are almsfood eaters, who go on unbroken
alm.sround from house to house, who delight in gathering their food;
when they have entered among the houses they will not consent even
when invited to sit down. But I sometimes eat on invitation meals of
choice rice [8] and many sauces and curries. So if my disciples
honoured me … with the thought: ‘The recluse Gotama is content
with any kind of almsfood and commends contentment with any kind of
almsfood,’ then those disciples of mine who are almsfood eaters …
should not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality,
nor should they live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting
me.</P>
<P  >“Suppose,
Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me,
and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the
thought: ‘The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of resting
place and commends contentment with any kind of resting place.’ Now
there are disciples of mine who are tree-root dwellers and open-air
dwellers, who do not use a roof for eight months [of the year], while
I sometimes live in gabled mansions plastered within and without,
protected against the wind, secured by door bolts, with shuttered
windows. So if my disciples honoured me … with the thought: ‘The
recluse Gotama is content with any kind of resting place and commends
contentment with any kind of resting place,’ then those disciples
of mine who are tree-root dwellers and open-air dwellers … should
not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality, nor
should they live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me.</P>
<P  >“Suppose,
Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me,
and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the
thought: ‘The recluse Gotama is secluded and commends seclusion.’
Now there are disciples of mine who are forest dwellers, dwellers in
remote resting places, who live withdrawn in remote jungle-thicket
resting places and return to the midst of the Sangha once each
half-month for the recitation of the Patimokkha. But I sometimes live
surrounded by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, by men and women lay
followers, by kings and kings’ ministers, by other sectarians and
their disciples. So if my disciples honoured me … with the thought:
‘The recluse Gotama is secluded and commends seclusion,’ [9] then
those disciples of mine who are forest dwellers … should not
honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality, nor should
they live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me. Thus,
Udayin, it is not because of these five qualities that my disciples
honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in dependence on
me, honouring and respecting me.</P>
<P  >10.
“However, Udayin, there are five other qualities because of which
my disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in
dependence on me, honouring and respecting me. What are the five?</P>
<H3 >(I. THE HIGHER VIRTUE)</H3>
<P  >11.
“Here, Udayin, my disciples esteem me for the higher virtue thus:
‘The recluse Gotama is virtuous, he possesses the supreme aggregate
of virtue.’ This is the first quality because of which my disciples
honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in dependence on
me, honouring and respecting me.</P>
<H3 >(II. KNOWLEDGE AND VISION)</H3>
<P  >12.
“Again, Udayin, my disciples esteem me for my excellent knowledge
and vision thus: ‘When the recluse Gotama says “I know,” he
truly knows; when he says “I see,” he truly sees. The recluse
Gotama teaches the Dhamma through direct knowledge, not without
direct knowledge; he teaches the Dhamma with a sound basis, not
without a sound basis; he teaches the Dhamma in a convincing manner,
not in an unconvincing manner.’ This is the second quality because
of which [10] my disciples honour me …</P>
<H3 >(III. THE HIGHER WISDOM)</H3>
<P  >13.
“Again, Udayin, my disciples esteem me for the higher wisdom thus:
‘The recluse Gotama is wise; he possesses the supreme aggregate of
wisdom. It is impossible that he should not foresee the future
courses of doctrine<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote761anc" HREF="#sdendnote761sym"><SUP>dcclxi</SUP></A></SUP>
or that he should not be able to confute with reasons the current
doctrines of others.’ What do you think, Udayin? Would my
disciples, knowing and seeing thus, break in and interrupt me?” -
“No, venerable sir.” - “I do not expect instruction from my
disciples; invariably, it is my disciples who expect instruction from
me. This is the third quality because of which my disciples honour me
…</P>
<H3 >(IV. THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS)</H3>
<P  >14.
“Again, Udayin, when my disciples have met with suffering and
become victims of suffering, prey to suffering, they come to me and
ask me about the noble truth of suffering. Being asked, I explain to
them the noble truth of suffering, and I satisfy their minds with my
explanation. They ask me about the noble truth of the origin of
suffering … about the noble truth of the cessation of suffering …
about the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering. Being asked, I explain to them the noble truth of the way
leading to the cessation of suffering, and I satisfy their minds with
my explanation. This is the fourth quality [11] because of which my
disciples honour me …</P>
<H3 >(V. THE WAY TO DEVELOP WHOLESOME STATES)</H3>
<H4 >(1. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness)</H4>

“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the four foundations of mindfulness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote762anc" HREF="#sdendnote762sym"><SUP>dcclxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body, ardent, fully
aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the
world. He abides contemplating feelings as feelings … He abides
contemplating mind as mind … He abides contemplating mind-objects
as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world. And thereby many disciples of
mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote763anc" HREF="#sdendnote763sym"><SUP>dcclxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H4 >(2. The Four Right Kinds of Striving)</H4>
<P  >16.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the four right kinds of striving. Here a bhikkhu awakens zeal
for the non-arising of unarisen evil unwholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. He awakens zeal
for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome states … He awakens
zeal for the arising of unarisen wholesome states … He awakens zeal
for the continuance, non-disappearance, strengthening, increase, and
fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. And thereby
many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and
perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(3. The Four Bases for Spiritual Power)</H4>
<P  >17.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the four bases for spiritual power. Here a bhikkhu develops
the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to zeal
and determined striving. He develops the basis for spiritual power
consisting in concentration due to energy and determined striving. He
develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration
due to [purity of] mind and determined striving. He develops the
basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to
investigation and determined striving. And thereby many disciples of
mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(4. The Five Faculties)</H4>
<P  >18.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the five spiritual faculties. Here [12] a bhikkhu develops
the faculty of faith, which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment.
He develops the faculty of energy … the faculty of mindfulness …
the faculty of concentration … the faculty of wisdom, which leads
to peace, leads to enlightenment. And thereby many disciples of mine
abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(5. The Five Powers)</H4>
<P  >19.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the five powers. Here a bhikkhu develops the power of faith,
which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment. He develops the power
of energy … the power of mindfulness … the power of concentration
… the power of wisdom, which leads to peace, leads to
enlightenment. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having
reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(6. The Seven Enlightenment Factors)</H4>
<P  >20.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the seven enlightenment factors. Here a bhikkhu develops the
mindfulness enlightenment factor, which is supported by seclusion,
dispassion, and cessation, and results in relinquishment. He develops
the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor … the energy
enlightenment factor … the rapture enlightenment factor … the
tranquillity enlightenment factor … the concentration enlightenment
factor … the equanimity enlightenment factor, which is supported by
seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and results in relinquishment.
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(7. The Noble Eightfold Path)</H4>
<P  >21.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the Noble Eightfold Path. Here a bhikkhu develops right view,
right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. And thereby many
disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and
perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(8. The Eight Liberations)</H4>
<P  >22.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the eight liberations.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote764anc" HREF="#sdendnote764sym"><SUP>dcclxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Possessed of material form, one sees forms: this is the first
liberation. Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms
externally: this is the second liberation. One is resolved only upon
the beautiful: this is the third liberation. [13] With the complete
surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of
perceptions of sensory impact, with non-attention to perceptions of
diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite,’ one enters upon and
abides in the base of infinite space: this is the fourth liberation.
By completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware that
‘consciousness is infinite,’ one enters upon and abides in the
base of infinite consciousness: this is the fifth liberation. By
completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness, aware that
‘there is nothing,’ one enters upon and abides in the base of
nothingness: this is the sixth liberation. By completely surmounting
the base of nothingness, one enters upon and abides in the base of
neither-perception-nornon-perception: this is the seventh liberation.
By completely surmounting the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, one enters upon and abides in
the cessation of perception and feeling: this is the eighth
liberation. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached
the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(9. The Eight Bases for Transcendence)</H4>
<P  >23.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the eight bases for transcendence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote765anc" HREF="#sdendnote765sym"><SUP>dcclxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, limited, fair
and ugly; by transcending them, one perceives thus: I know, I see.’
This is the first base for transcendence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote766anc" HREF="#sdendnote766sym"><SUP>dcclxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, immeasurable,
fair and ugly; by transcending them, one perceives thus: ‘I know, I
see.’ This is the second base for transcendence. Not perceiving
form internally, one sees forms externally, limited, fair and ugly;
by transcending them, one perceives thus: ‘I know, I see.’ This
is the third base for transcendence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote767anc" HREF="#sdendnote767sym"><SUP>dcclxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally,
immeasurable, fair and ugly; by transcending them, one perceives
thus: ‘I know, I see.’ This is the fourth base for transcendence.
Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, blue, of
blue colour, blue in appearance, with blue luminosity. Just like a
flax flower, which is blue, of blue colour, blue in appearance, with
blue luminosity, or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides,
which is blue, of blue colour, blue in appearance, with blue
luminosity; so too, not perceiving form internally, one sees forms
externally … with blue luminosity; by transcending them, one
perceives thus: ‘I know, I see.’ This is the fifth [14] base for
transcendence. Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms
externally, yellow, of yellow colour, yellow in appearance, with
yellow luminosity. Just like a kannikara flower, which is yellow, of
yellow colour, yellow in appearance, with yellow luminosity, or just
like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides, which is yellow, of
yellow colour, yellow in appearance, with yellow luminosity; so too,
not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally … with
yellow luminosity; by transcending them, one perceives thus: ‘I
know, I see.’ This is the sixth base for transcendence. Not
perceiving form externally, one sees forms externally, red, of red
colour, red in appearance, with red luminosity. Just like a hibiscus
flower, which is red, of red colour, red in appearance, with red
luminosity, or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides,
which is red, of red colour, red in appearance, with red luminosity;
so too, not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally …
with red luminosity; by transcending them, one perceives thus: ‘I
know, I see.’ This is the seventh base for transcendence. Not
perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, white, of
white colour, white in appearance, with white luminosity. Just like
the morning star, which is white, of white colour, white in
appearance, with white luminosity, or just like Benares cloth
smoothened on both sides, which is white, of white colour, white in
appearance, with white luminosity; so too, not perceiving form
internally, one sees forms externally … with white luminosity; by
transcending them, one perceives thus: ‘I know, I see.’ This is
the eighth base for transcendence. And thereby many disciples of mine
abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(10. The Ten Kasinas)</H4>
<P  >24.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the ten kasina bases.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote768anc" HREF="#sdendnote768sym"><SUP>dcclxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
One contemplates the earth kasina above, below, and across, undivided
and immeasurable. Another contemplates the water-kasina … Another
contemplates the fire-kasina … Another contemplates the air-kasina
… Another contemplates the blue-kasina … Another contemplates the
yellow-kasina … Another contemplates the red-kasina … Another

space-kasina … Another contemplates the consciousness-kasina [15]
above, below, and across, undivided and immeasurable. And thereby

consummation of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(11. The Four Jhanas)</H4>
<P  >25.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the four jhanas. Here, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in
the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He makes the
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and
pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote769anc" HREF="#sdendnote769sym"><SUP>dcclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as a skilled bath man or a bath man’s apprentice heaps bath
powder in a metal basin and, sprinkling it gradually with water,
kneads it till the moisture wets his ball of bath powder, soaks it
and pervades it inside and out, yet the ball itself does not ooze; so
too, a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion.</P>
<P  >26.
“Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has
self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. He makes
the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench, steep, fill,
and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration. Just as
though there were a lake whose waters welled up from below and it had
no inflow from east, west, north, or south [16] and would not be
replenished from time to time by showers of rain, then the cool fount
of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench,
steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that there would be no part of
the whole lake unpervaded by cool water; so too, a bhikkhu makes the
rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and
pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration.</P>
<P  >27.
“Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu abides
in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure
with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on
account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding
who has equanimity and is mindful.’ He makes</P>
<P  >the
pleasure divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this
body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the
pleasure divested of rapture. Just as in a pond of blue or red or
white lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water
thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and cool water
drenches, steeps, fills, and pervades them to their tips and their
roots, so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by
cool water; so too, a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapture.</P>
<P  >28.
“Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana, which has neitherpain-nor-pleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. He sits pervading this body
with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the pure bright mind. Just as though a man were sitting
covered from the head down with a white cloth, so that there would be
no part of his whole body not covered by the white cloth; so too, a
bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that
there is no part of his whole body [17] unpervaded by the pure bright
mind. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(12. Insight Knowledge)</H4>
<P  >29.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
understand thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote770anc" HREF="#sdendnote770sym"><SUP>dcclxx</SUP></A></SUP>
‘This body of mine, made of material form, consisting of the four
great elements, procreated by a mother and father, and built up out
of boiled rice and porridge, is subject to impermanence, to being
worn and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration, and this
consciousness of mine is supported by it and bound up with it.’
Suppose there were a beautiful beryl gem of purest water,
eight-faceted, well cut, clear and limpid, possessed of all good
qualities, and through it a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread
would be strung. Then a man with good sight, taking it in his hand,
might review it thus: ‘This is a beautiful beryl gem of purest
water, eight-faceted, well cut, clear and limpid, possessed of all
good qualities, and</P>
<P  >through
it is strung a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.’ So too,
I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand thus: ‘This
body of mine … is subject to impermanence, to being worn and rubbed
away, to dissolution and disintegration, and this consciousness of
mine is supported by it and bound up with it.’ And thereby many
disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and
perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(13. The Mind-made Body)</H4>
<P  >30.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to create
from this body another body having form, mind-made, with all its
limbs, lacking no faculty. Just as though a man were to pull out a
reed from its sheath and think thus: ‘This is the sheath, this is
the reed; the sheath is one, the reed is another; it is from the
sheath that the reed has been pulled out’; or just as though a man
were to pull out a sword from its scabbard and think thus: ‘This is
the sword, this is the scabbard; the sword is one, the scabbard
another; it is from the scabbard that the sword has been pulled out’;
[18] or just as though a man were to pull a snake out of its slough
and think thus: ‘This is the snake, this is the slough; the snake
is one, the slough another; it is from the slough that the snake has
been pulled out.’ So too, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way
to create from this body another body having form, mind-made, with
all its limbs, lacking no faculty. And thereby many disciples of mine
abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(14. The Kinds of Supernormal Power)</H4>
<P  >31.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to wield
the various kinds of supernormal power: having been one, they become
many; having been many, they become one; they appear and vanish; they
go unhindered through walls, through enclosures, through mountains,
as though through space; they dive in and out of the earth as though
it were water; they walk on water without sinking as though it were
earth; seated cross-legged, they travel in space like birds; with
their hands they touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and
mighty; they wield bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-world.
Just</P>
<P  >as
a skilled potter or his apprentice might create and fashion out of
well-prepared clay any shape of pot he wished; or just as a skilled
ivory-worker or his apprentice might create and fashion out of
well-prepared ivory any ivory work of art he wished; or just as a
skilled goldsmith or his apprentice might create and fashion out of
well-prepared gold any gold work of art he wished; so too, I have
proclaimed to my disciples the way to wield the various kinds of
supernormal power … [19] … they wield bodily mastery even as far
as the Brahma-world. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having
reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(15. The Divine Ear Element)</H4>
<P  >32.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby
with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the
human, they hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human,
those that are far as well as near. Just as a vigorous trumpeter
might make himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters; so
too, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the
divine ear element … far as well as near. And thereby many
disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and
perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(16. Understanding the Minds of Others)</H4>
<P  >33.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
understand the minds of other beings, of other persons, having
encompassed them with their own minds. They understand a mind
affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as
unaffected by lust; they understand a mind affected by hate as
affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate;
they understand a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion
and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; they
understand a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as
distracted; they understand an exalted mind as exalted and an
unexalted mind as unexalted; they understand a surpassed mind as
surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; they understand a
concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as
unconcentrated; they understand</P>
<P  >a
liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated.
Just as a man or a woman - young, youthful, and fond of ornaments -
on viewing the image of his or her own face in a clean bright mirror
or in a bowl of clear water, would know if there were a spot thus:
‘There is a spot,’ [20] or would know if there were no spot thus:
‘There is no spot’; so too, I have proclaimed to my disciples the
way to understand … an unliberated mind as unliberated. And thereby
many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and
perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(17. The Recollection of Past Lives)</H4>
<P  >34.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
recollect their manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births,
three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births,
thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a
thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of
world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of
world-contraction and expansion: ‘There I was so named, of such a
clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my
experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away
from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named …
and passing away from there, I reappeared here.’ Thus with their
aspects and particulars they recollect their manifold past lives.
Just as a man might go from his own village to another village and
then back again to his own village. He might think: ‘I went from my
own village to that village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in
such a way, spoke in such a way, kept silent in such a way; and from
that village I went to that other village and there [21] I stood in
such a way … kept silent in such a way; and from that village I
came back again to my own village.’ So too, I have proclaimed to my
disciples the way to recollect their manifold lives … Thus with
their aspects and particulars they recollect their manifold past
lives. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(18. The Divine Eye)</H4>
<P  >35.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby
with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, they
see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair
and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. They understand how beings pass
on according to their actions thus: ‘These worthy beings who were
ill-conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones,
wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions,
on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a
state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in
hell; but these worthy beings who were well-conducted in body,
speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views,
giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in
the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified
and surpasses the human, they see beings passing away and
reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and
unfortunate, and they understand how beings pass on according to
their actions. Just as though there were two houses with doors and a
man with good sight standing there between them saw people entering
the houses and coming out and passing to and fro. So too, I have
proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine eye …
They understand how beings pass on according to their actions. And
thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation
and perfection of direct knowledge. [22]</P>
<H4 >(19. The Destruction of the Taints)</H4>
<P  >36.
“Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby
by realising for themselves with direct knowledge, they here and now
enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by
wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints. Just as
if there were a lake in a mountain recess, clear, limpid, and
undisturbed, so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could
see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming
about and resting. He might think: ‘There is this lake, clear,
limpid, and undisturbed, and there are</P>
<P  >these
shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming
about and resting.’ So too, I have proclaimed to my disciples the
way whereby by realising for themselves with direct knowledge, they
here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and
deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the
taints. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the

<P  >37.
“This, Udayin, is the fifth quality because of which my disciples
honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in dependence on
me, honouring and respecting me.</P>
<P  >38.
“These, Udayin, are the five qualities because of which my
disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in
dependence on me, honouring and respecting me.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The wanderer Udayin was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading79"  >
78. Samanamandika Sutta - Samanamandikaputta</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. Now on that
occasion the wanderer Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta was staying in
Mallika’s Park, the single-hailed Tinduka plantation for
philosophical debates,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote771anc" HREF="#sdendnote771sym"><SUP>dcclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
[23] together with a large following of wanderers, with as many as
three hundred wanderers.</P>
<P  >2.
The carpenter Pancakanga went out from Savatthi at midday in order to
see the Blessed One. Then he thought: “It is not the right time to
see the Blessed One; he is still in retreat. And it is not the right
time to see bhikkhus worthy of esteem; they are still in retreat.
Suppose I went to Mallika’s Park, to the wanderer Uggahamana
Samanamandikaputta?” And he went to Mallika’s Park.</P>
<P  >3.
Now on that occasion the wanderer Uggahamana was seated with a large
assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar, loudly and noisily
talking many kinds of pointless talk, such as talk of kings … (as
Sutta 76, §4) … whether things are so or are not so.</P>
<P  >The
wanderer Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta saw the carpenter Pancakanga
coming in the distance. Seeing him, he quieted his own assembly thus:
“Sirs, be quiet; sirs make no noise. Here comes the carpenter
Pancakanga, a disciple of the recluse Gotama, one of the recluse
Gotama’s white-clothed lay disciples staying at Savatthi. These
venerable ones like quiet; they are disciplined in quiet; they
commend quiet. Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one, he will
think to join us.” Then the wanderers became silent.</P>
<P  >4.
The carpenter Pancakanga went to the wanderer Uggahamana and
exchanged greetings with him. [24] When this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The wanderer Uggahamana
then said to him:</P>
<P  >5.
“Carpenter, when a man possesses four qualities, I describe him as
accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome,
attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic invincible. What are
the four? Here he does no evil bodily actions, he utters no evil
speech, he has no evil intentions, and he does not make his living by
any evil livelihood. When a man possesses these four qualities, I
describe him as accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what
is wholesome, attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic
invincible.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then the carpenter Pancakanga neither approved nor disapproved of the
wanderer Uggahamana’s words. Without doing either he rose from his
seat and went away, thinking: “I shall learn the meaning of this
statement in the presence of the Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >7.
Then he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he
sat down at one side and reported to the Blessed One his entire
conversation with the wanderer Uggahamana. Thereupon the Blessed One
said:</P>
<P  >8.
“If that were so, carpenter, then a young tender infant lying prone
is accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome,
attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic invincible, according
to the wanderer Uggahamana’s statement. For a young tender infant
lying prone does not even have the notion ‘body,’ so how should
he do an evil action beyond mere wriggling? A young tender infant
lying prone does not even have the notion ‘speech,’ so how should
he utter evil speech beyond mere whining? A young tender infant lying
prone does not even have the notion ‘intention,’ so how should he
have evil intentions beyond mere sulking? A young tender infant lying
prone does not even have the notion ‘livelihood,’ so how [25]
should he make his living by evil livelihood beyond being suckled at
his mother’s breast? If that were so, carpenter, then a young
tender infant lying prone is accomplished in what is wholesome …
according to the wanderer Uggahamana’s statement.</P>
<P  >“When
a man possesses four qualities, carpenter, I describe him, not as
accomplished in what is wholesome or perfected in what is wholesome
or attained to the supreme attainment or an ascetic invincible, but
as one who stands in the same category as the young tender infant
lying prone. What are the four? Here he does no evil bodily actions,
he utters no evil speech, he has no evil intentions, and he does not
make his living by any evil livelihood. When a man possesses these
four qualities, I describe him, not as accomplished … but as one
who stands in the same category as the young tender infant lying
prone.</P>
<P  >9.
“When a man possesses ten qualities, carpenter, I describe him as
accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome,

training, the right mindfulness of one beyond training, the right
concentration of one beyond training, the right knowledge of one
beyond training, and the right deliverance of one beyond training.
When a man possesses these ten qualities, I describe him as
accomplished in what is wholesome, perfected in what is wholesome,
attained to the supreme attainment, an ascetic invincible.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The carpenter Pancakanga was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

79. Culasakuludayi Sutta - The Shorter Discourse to Sakuludayin</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Now on that
occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was staying in the Peacocks’
Sanctuary, the wanderers’ park, with a large assembly of wanderers.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went to Rajagaha for alms. Then he thought: “It
is still too early to wander for alms in Rajagaha. Suppose I went to
the wanderer Sakuludayin in the Peacocks’ Sanctuary, the wanderers’
park.”</P>
<P  >3-4.
Then the Blessed One went to the Peacocks’ Sanctuary, the
wanderers’ park. Now on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was
seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar …
(as Sutta 77, §§4-5) [30] … For what discussion are you sitting
together here now, Udayin? And what was your discussion that was
interrupted?”</P>
<P  >5.
“Venerable sir, let be the discussion for which we are now sitting
together here. The Blessed One can well hear about it later.
Venerable sir, when I do not come to this assembly, then it sits
talking many kinds of pointless talk. But when I have come to this
assembly, then it sits looking up to me, thinking: ‘Let us hear the
Dhamma that the recluse Udayin expounds.’ However, when [31] the
Blessed One comes, then both I and this assembly sit looking up to
the Blessed One, thinking: ‘Let us hear the Dhamma that the Blessed
One expounds.’“</P>
<P  >6.
“Then, Udayin, suggest something that I should speak about.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, in recent days there was one claiming to be omniscient and
all-seeing, to have complete knowledge and vision thus: ‘Whether I
am walking or standing or sleeping or awake, knowledge and vision are
continuously and uninterruptedly present to me.’ When I asked him a
question about the past, he prevaricated, led the talk aside, and
showed anger, hate, and bitterness. Then I remembered the Blessed One
thus: ‘Ah, surely it is the Blessed One, surely it is the Sublime
One who is skilled in these things.’“</P>
<P  >“But,
Udayin, who was it that claimed to be omniscient and all-seeing …
yet when asked a question by you about the past, prevaricated, led
the talk aside, and showed anger, hate, and bitterness?”</P>
<P  >“It
was the Nigantha Nataputta, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Udayin, if someone should recollect his manifold past lives, that
is, one birth, two births … thus, with their aspects and
particulars, should he recollect his manifold past lives, then either
he might ask me a question about the past or I might ask him a
question about the past, and he might satisfy my mind with his answer
to my question or I might satisfy his mind with my answer to his
question. If someone with the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, should see beings passing away and reappearing,
inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate …
and understand how beings pass on according to their actions, then
either he might ask me a question about the future [32] or I might
ask him a question about the future, and he might satisfy my mind
with his answer to my question or I might satisfy his mind with my
answer to his question. But let be the past, Udayin, let be the
future. I shall teach you the Dhamma: When this exists, that comes to
be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist,
that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote782anc" HREF="#sdendnote782sym"><SUP>dcclxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
“Venerable sir, I cannot even recollect with their aspects and
particulars all that I have experienced within this present
existence, so how should I recollect my manifold past lives, that is,
one birth, two births … with their aspects and particulars, as the
Blessed One does? And I cannot now even see a mud-goblin, so how
should I with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the
human, see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and
superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate … and understand
how beings pass on according to their actions, as the Blessed One
does? But, venerable sir, when the Blessed One told me: ‘But let be
the past, Udayin, let be the future. I shall teach you the Dhamma:
When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that
arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the
cessation of this, that ceases’ - that is even more unclear to me.
Perhaps, venerable sir, I might satisfy the Blessed One’s mind by
answering a question about our own teachers’ doctrine.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Well, Udayin, what is taught in your own teachers’ doctrine?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, it is taught that in our own teachers’ doctrine: ‘This is
the perfect splendour, this is the perfect splendour!’“</P>
<P  >“But,
Udayin, since it is taught in your own teachers’ doctrine: ‘This
is the perfect splendour, this is the perfect splendour!’ - what is
that perfect splendour?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by
any other splendour higher or more sublime.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Udayin, what is that splendour which is unsurpassed by any other
splendour higher or more sublime?” [33]</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by
any other splendour higher or more sublime.”</P>
<P  >10.
Udayin, you might continue for a long time in this way. You say:
‘Venerable sir, that splendour is the perfect splendour which is
unsurpassed by any other splendour higher or more sublime,’ yet you
do not indicate what that splendour is. Suppose a man were to say: ‘I
am in love with the most beautiful girl in this country.’ Then they
would ask him: ‘Good man, that most beautiful girl in this country
with whom you are in love - do you know whether she is from the noble
class or the brahmin class or the merchant class or the worker
class?’ and he would reply: ‘No.’ Then they would ask him:
‘Good man, that most beautiful girl in this country with whom you
are in love - do you know her name and clan?.. .Whether she is tall
or short or of middle height? … Whether she is dark or brown or
goldenskinned? … What village or town or city she lives in?’ and
he would reply: ‘No.’ And then they would ask him: ‘Good man,
do you then love a girl you have never known or seen?’ and he would
reply: ‘Yes.’ What do you think, Udayin, that being so, would not
that man’s talk amount to nonsense?”</P>
<P  >“Surely,
venerable sir, that being so, that man’s talk would amount to
nonsense.”</P>
<P  >“But
in the same way, Udayin, you say thus: ‘That splendour is the
perfect splendour which is unsurpassed by any other splendour higher
or more sublime,’ yet you do not indicate what that splendour is.”</P>
<P  >11.
“Venerable sir, just as a beautiful beryl gem of purest water,
eight-faceted, well cut, lying on red brocade, glows, radiates, and
shines, of such splendour is the self [surviving] unimpaired after
death.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote783anc" HREF="#sdendnote783sym"><SUP>dcclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
“What do you think, Udayin? This beautiful beryl gem of purest
water, eight-faceted, well cut, lying on red brocade, [34] which
glows, radiates, and shines, or a glowworm in the thick darkness of
the night - of these two, which gives off the splendour that is more
excellent and sublime?” - “The glowworm in the thick darkness of
the night, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >13.
“What do you think, Udayin? This glowworm in the thick darkness of
the night or an oil-lamp in the thick darkness of the night - of
these two, which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and
sublime?” - “The oil-lamp, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >14.
“What do you think, Udayin? This oil-lamp in the thick darkness of
the night or a great bonfire in the thick darkness of the night - of
these two, which gives off the splendour that is more excellent and
sublime?” - “The great bonfire, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >15.
“What do you think, Udayin? This great bonfire in the thick
darkness of the night or the morning star towards dawn in a clear
cloudless sky - of these two, which gives off the splendour that is
more excellent and sublime?” - “The morning star towards dawn in
a clear cloudless sky, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >16.
“What do you think, Udayin? The morning star towards dawn in a
clear cloudless sky or the full moon at midnight in a clear cloudless
sky on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth - of these two, which gives
off the splendour that is more excellent and sublime?” - “The
full moon at midnight in a clear cloudless sky on the Uposatha day of
the fifteenth, venerable sir.” [35]</P>
<P  >17.
“What do you think, Udayin? The full moon at midnight in a clear
cloudless sky on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, or the full disk
of the sun at midday in a clear cloudless sky in autumn in the last
month of the rainy season - of these two, which gives off the
splendour that is more excellent and sublime?” - “The full disk
of the sun at midday in a clear cloudless sky in autumn in the last
month of the rainy season, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >18.
“Beyond this, Udayin, I know of very many gods [whose splendour]
the radiance of the sun and moon does not match, yet I do not say
that there is no other splendour higher or more sublime than that
splendour. But you, Udayin, say of that splendour which is lower and
meaner than a glowworm’s: ‘This is the perfect splendour,’ yet
you do not indicate what that splendour is.”</P>
<P  >19.
“The Blessed One has terminated the discussion; the Sublime One has
terminated the discussion.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Udayin, why do you say that?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, it is taught in our own teachers’ doctrine: ‘This is the
perfect splendour, this is the perfect splendour.’ But on being
pressed and questioned and cross-questioned about our own teachers’
doctrine by the Blessed One, we are found empty, hollow, and
mistaken.”</P>
<P  >20.
“How is it, Udayin, is there an entirely pleasant world? Is there a
practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, it is taught in our own teachers’ doctrine: ‘There is an
entirely pleasant world; there is a practical way to realise an
entirely pleasant world.’“</P>
<P  >21.
“But, Udayin, what is that practical way to realise an entirely
pleasant world?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
venerable sir, abandoning the killing of living beings, someone
abstains from killing living beings; abandoning the taking of what is
not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; abandoning
misconduct in sensual pleasures, he abstains from misconduct in
sensual pleasures; [36] abandoning false speech, he abstains from
false speech; or else he undertakes and practises some kind of
asceticism. This is the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant
world.”</P>
<P  >22.
“What do you think, Udayin? On an occasion when he abandons the
killing of living beings and abstains from killing living beings,
does his self then feel only pleasure or both pleasure and pain?”</P>
<P  >“Both
pleasure and pain, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, Udayin? On an occasion when he abandons the taking of
what is not given and abstains from taking what is not given … when
he abandons misconduct in sensual pleasures and abstains from
misconduct in sensual pleasures … when he abandons false speech and
abstains from false speech, does his self then feel only pleasure or
both pleasure and pain?”</P>
<P  >“Both
pleasure and pain, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, Udayin? On an occasion when he under takes and
practises some kind of asceticism, does his self then feel only
pleasure or both pleasure and pain?”</P>
<P  >“Both
pleasure and pain, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, Udayin? Does the realisation of an entirely pleasant
world come about by following a way of mixed pleasure and pain?”</P>
<P  >23.
“The Blessed One has terminated the discussion; the Sublime One has
terminated the discussion.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Udayin, why do you say that?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, it is taught in our own teachers’ doctrine:</P>
<P  >‘There
is an entirely pleasant world; there is a practical way to realise an
entirely pleasant world.’ But on being pressed and questioned and
cross-questioned about our own teachers’ doctrine by the Blessed
One, we are found empty, hollow, and mistaken. But how is it,
venerable sir, is there an entirely pleasant world? Is there a
practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world?” [37]</P>
<P  >24.
“There is an entirely pleasant world, Udayin; there is a practical
way to realise an entirely pleasant world.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, what is that practical way to realise an entirely pleasant
world?”</P>
<P  >25.
“Here, Udayin, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana … With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he
enters upon and abides in the second jhana … in the third jhana …
This is the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant world.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, that is not the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant
world; at that point an entirely pleasant world has already been
realised.”</P>
<P  >“Udayin,
at that point an entirely pleasant world has not yet been realised;
that is only the practical way to realise an entirely pleasant
world.”</P>
<P  >26.
When this was said, the wanderer Sakuludayin’s assembly made an
uproar, saying very loudly and noisily: “We are lost along with our
own teachers’ doctrines! We are lost along with our own teachers’
doctrines! We know nothing higher than that!”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote784anc" HREF="#sdendnote784sym"><SUP>dcclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Then
the wanderer Sakuludayin quieted those wanderers and asked the
Blessed One:</P>
<P  >27.
“Venerable sir, at what point is an entirely pleasant world
realised?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
Udayin, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana, which has neitherpain-nor-pleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. He dwells with those deities
who have arisen in an entirely pleasant world and he talks with them
and enters into conversation with them.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote785anc" HREF="#sdendnote785sym"><SUP>dcclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
It is at this point that an entirely pleasant world has been
realised.”</P>
<P  >28.
“Venerable sir, surely it is for the sake of realising that
entirely pleasant world that bhikkhus lead the holy life under the
Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >“It
is not for the sake of realising that entirely pleasant world that
bhikkhus lead the holy life under me. There are other states, Udayin,
higher and more sublime [than that] and it is for the sake of
realising them that bhikkhus lead the holy life under me.” [38]</P>
<P  >“What
are those higher and more sublime states, venerable sir, for the sake
of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under the Blessed
One?”</P>
<P  >29-36.
“Here, Udayin, a Tathagata appears in the world, accomplished,
fully enlightened … (as Sutta 51, §§12-19) … he purifies his
mind from doubt.</P>
<P  >37.
“Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in
the first jhana … This, Udayin, is a higher and more sublime state
for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me.</P>
<P  >38-40.
“Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana … the third
jhana … the fourth jhana. This too, Udayin, is a higher and more
sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy
life under me.</P>
<P  >41.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one
birth, two births … (as Sutta 51, §24) … Thus with their</P>
<P  >aspects
and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. This too,
Udayin, is a higher and more sublime state for the sake of realising
which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me.</P>
<P  >42.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 51, §25) … Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions. This too, Udayin, is a higher and more
sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the holy
life under me.</P>
<P  >43.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. He understands as it actually is : ‘This is suffering’
… (as Sutta 51, §26) [39] … He understands as it actually is:
‘This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.’</P>
<P  >44.
“When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It is
liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’ This too, Udayin, is a higher and
more sublime state for the sake of realising which bhikkhus lead the
holy life under me.</P>
<P  >“These,
Udayin, are those higher and more sublime states for the sake of
realising which bhikkhus lead the holy life under me.”</P>
<P  >45.
When this was said, the wanderer Sakuludayin said to the Blessed One:
“Magnificent, venerable sir! Magnificent, venerable sir! The
Blessed One has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to the Blessed One for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would
receive the going forth under the Blessed One, venerable sir, I would
receive the full admission.”</P>
<P  >46.
When this was said, the wanderer Sakuludayiri s assembly</P>
<P  >addressed
him thus: “Do not lead the holy life under the recluse Gotama,
Master Udayin. Having been a teacher, Master Udayin, do not live as a
pupil. For Master Udayin to do so would be as if a water jug were to
become a pitcher. Do not lead the holy life under the recluse Gotama,
Master Udayin. Having been a teacher, Master Udayin, do not live as a
pupil.”</P>
<P  >That
is how the wanderer Sakuludayiri s assembly obstructed him from
leading the holy life under the Blessed One.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote786anc" HREF="#sdendnote786sym"><SUP>dcclxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>

80. Vekhanassa Sutta - To Vekhanassa</H2>
<P  >[40]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatth3 in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the wanderer Vekhanassa went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote787anc" HREF="#sdendnote787sym"><SUP>dcclxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one
side and in the Blessed One’s presence he uttered this exclamation:</P>
<P  >“This
is the perfect splendour, this is the perfect splendour!”</P>
<P  >“But,
Kaccana, why do you say: ‘This is the perfect splendour, this is
the perfect splendour!’? What is that perfect splendour?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Gotama, that splendour is the perfect splendour which is unsurpassed
by any other splendour higher or more sublime.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Kaccana, what is that splendour that is unsurpassed by any other
splendour higher or more sublime?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Gotama, that splendour is the perfect splendour that is unsurpassed
by any other splendour higher or more sublime.”</P>
<P  >3-11.
“Kaccana, you might continue for a long time in this way … (as
Sutta 79, §§10-18) … [41, 42] yet you do not indicate what that
splendour is.</P>
<P  >12.
“Kaccana, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote788anc" HREF="#sdendnote788sym"><SUP>dcclxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
What five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body [43] that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >13.
“Now, Kaccana, the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these
five cords of sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasure. Thus
sensual pleasure [arises] through sensual pleasures, but beyond
sensual pleasure there is a pleasure higher than the sensual, and
that is declared to be the highest among them.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote789anc" HREF="#sdendnote789sym"><SUP>dcclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
When this was said, the wanderer Vekhanassa said: “It is wonderful,
Master Gotama, it is marvellous, how well that has been expressed by
Master Gotama: ‘Thus sensual pleasure [arises] through sensual
pleasures, but beyond sensual pleasure there is a pleasure higher
than the sensual, and that is declared to be the highest among
them.’“</P>
<P  >“Kaccana,
for you who are of another view, who accept another teaching, who
approve of another teaching, who pursue a different training, who
follow a different teacher, it is hard to know what sensuality is, or
what sensual pleasure is, or what the pleasure higher than the
sensual is. But those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints
destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done,
laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of
being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge - it is
they who would know what sensuality is, what sensual pleasure is, and
what the pleasure higher than the sensual is.”</P>
<P  >15.
When this was said, the wanderer Vekhanassa was angry and displeased,
and he reviled, disparaged, and censured the Blessed One, saying:
“The recluse Gotama will be worsted.” He then said to the Blessed
One: “So then there are some recluses and brahmins here who,
without knowing the past and without seeing the future, yet claim:
‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be
done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’
What they say turns out to be ridiculous; it turns out to be mere
words, empty and hollow.”</P>
<P  >16.
“If any recluses and brahmins [44], without knowing the past and
without seeing the future, yet claim: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy
life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no
more coming to any state of being,’ they can be confuted in
accordance with the Dhamma. Rather, let the past be, Kaccana, and let
the future be. Let a wise man come, one who is honest and sincere, a
man of rectitude. I instruct him, I teach him the Dhamma in such a
way that by practising as instructed he will soon know and see for
himself: ‘Thus, indeed, there rightly comes to be liberation from
the bond, that is, from the bond of ignorance.’ Suppose, Kaccana,
there were a young tender infant lying prone, bound by stout bonds
[at the four limbs] with the fifth at the neck; and later on, as a
result of his growth and the maturing of his faculties, those bonds
loosened, then he would know ‘I am free’ and there would be no
more bondage. So too, let a wise man come … ‘Thus, indeed, there
rightly comes to be liberation from the bond, that is, from the bond
of ignorance.’“</P>
<P  >17.
When this was said, the wanderer Vekhanassa said to the Blessed One:
“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear … (as Sutta 79, §19) … for
those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge
and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let the
Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for
refuge for life.”</P>

81. Ghatikara Sutta - Ghatikara the Potter</H2>
<P  >[45]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering
among the Kosalans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >2.
Then in a certain place beside the main road the Blessed One smiled.
It occurred to the venerable Ananda: “What is the reason, what is
the cause, for the Blessed One’s smile? Tathagatas do not smile for
no reason.” So he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and
extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed
One, asked him: “Venerable sir, what is the reason, what is the
cause, for the Blessed One’s smile? Tathagatas do not smile for no
reason.”</P>
<P  >3.
“Once, Ananda, in this place there was a prosperous and busy market
town called Vebhalinga, with many inhabitants and crowded with
people. Now the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, lived near the market town Vebhalinga. It was here, in
fact, that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, had his monastery; it was here, in fact, that the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, resided and
advised the Sangha of bhikkhus.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the venerable Ananda folded his patchwork cloak in four, and
spreading it out, said to the Blessed One: “Then, venerable sir,
let the Blessed One be seated. Thus this place will have been used by
two Accomplished Ones, Fully Enlightened Ones.”</P>
<P  >The
Blessed One sat down on the seat that had been made ready and
addressed the venerable Ananda thus:</P>
<P  >5.
“Once, Ananda, in this place there was a prosperous and busy market
town called Vebhalinga, with many inhabitants and crowded with
people. Now the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, lived near the market town Vebhalinga. It was here, in
fact, that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, had his monastery; it was here, in fact, that the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, resided [46]
and advised the Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >6.
“In Vebhalinga the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, had as a supporter, as his chief supporter, a potter
named Ghatikara. Ghatikara the potter had as a friend, as his close
friend, a brahmin student named Jotipala.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote790anc" HREF="#sdendnote790sym"><SUP>dccxc</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“One
day the potter Ghatikara addressed the brahmin student Jotipala thus:
‘My dear Jotipala, let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa,
accomplished and fully enlightened. I hold that it is good to see
that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened.’ The brahmin
student Jotipala replied: ‘Enough, my dear Ghatikara, what is the
use of seeing that bald-pated recluse?’</P>
<P  >“A
second and third time the potter Ghatikara said: ‘My dear Jotipala,
let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened. I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One,
accomplished and fully enlightened.’ And a second and a third time
the brahmin student Jotipala replied: ‘Enough, my dear Ghatikara,
what is the use of seeing that baldpated recluse?’ - ‘Then, my
dear Jotipala, let us take a loofah and bath powder and go to the
river to bathe.’ - ‘Very well,’ Jotipala replied.</P>
<P  >7.
“So the potter Ghatikara and the brahmin student Jotipala took a
loofah and bath powder and went to the river to bathe. Then Ghatikara
said to Jotipala: ‘My dear Jotipala, there is the monastery of the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, quite
nearby. Let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and
fully enlightened. I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One,
accomplished and fully enlightened.’ Jotipala replied: ‘Enough,
my dear Ghatikara, what is [47] the use of seeing that bald-pated
recluse?’</P>
<P  >“A
second and a third time Ghatikara said: ‘My dear Jotipala, there is
the monastery of the Blessed One Kassapa … ’ And a second and a
third time the brahmin student Jotipala replied: ‘Enough, my dear
Ghatikara, what is the use of seeing that bald pated recluse?’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote791anc" HREF="#sdendnote791sym"><SUP>dccxci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
“Then the potter Ghatikara seized the brahmin student Jotipala by
the belt and said: ‘My dear Jotipala, there is the monastery of the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, quite
nearby. Let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and
fully enlightened. I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One,
accomplished and fully enlightened.’ Then the brahmin student
Jotipala undid his belt and said: ‘Enough, my dear Ghatikara, what
is the use of seeing that bald-pated recluse?’</P>
<P  >9.
“Then, when the brahmin student Jotipala had washed his head, the
potter Ghatikara seized him by the hair and said:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote792anc" HREF="#sdendnote792sym"><SUP>dccxcii</SUP></A></SUP>
‘My dear Jotipala, there is the monastery of the Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, quite nearby. Let us go
and see the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened.
I hold that it is good to see that Blessed One, accomplished and
fully enlightened.’</P>
<P  >“Then
the brahmin student Jotipala thought: ‘It is wonderful, it is
marvellous that this potter Ghatikara, who is of a different birth,
should presume to seize me by the hair when we have washed our heads!
Surely this can be no simple matter.’ And he said to the potter
Ghatikara: ‘You go as far as this, my dear Ghatikara?’ - ‘I go
as far as this, my dear Jotipala; for so much [48] do I hold that it
is good to see that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened!’
- ‘Then, my dear Ghatikara, let go of me. Let us visit him.’</P>
<P  >10.
“So Ghatikara the potter and Jotipala the brahmin student went to
the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened.
Ghatikara, after paying homage to him, sat down at one side, while
Jotipala exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, he too sat down at one side. Ghatikara
then said to the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened: ‘Venerable sir, this is the brahmin student Jotipala,
my friend, my close friend. Let the Blessed One teach him the
Dhamma.’</P>
<P  >“Then
the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened,
instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged Ghatikara the potter and
Jotipala the brahmin student with an exposition of the Dhamma. At the
conclusion of the exposition, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One Kassapa’s words, they rose from their seats, and after
paying homage to the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, keeping him on their right, they departed.</P>
<P  >11.
“Then Jotipala asked Ghatikara: ‘Now that you have heard this
Dhamma, my dear Ghatikara, why don’t you go forth from the home
life into homelessness?’ -’My dear Jotipala, don’t you know
that I support my blind and aged parents?’ - ‘Then, my dear
Ghatikara, I shall go forth from the home life into homelessness.’</P>
<P  >12.
“So Ghatikara the potter and Jotipala the brahmin student went to
the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened. [49]
After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and Ghatikara
the potter said to the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened: ‘Venerable sir, this is the brahmin student Jotipala,
my friend, my close friend. Let the Blessed One give him the going
forth.’ And the brahmin student Jotipala received the going forth
from the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, and
he received the full admission.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote793anc" HREF="#sdendnote793sym"><SUP>dccxciii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
“Then not long after Jotipala the brahmin student had received the
full admission, a half-month after he had received the full
admission, the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, having stayed at Vebhalinga as long as he chose, set out
to wander towards Benares. Wandering by stages, he eventually arrived
at Benares, and there he went to live in the Deer Park at Isipatana.</P>
<P  >14.
“Now King Kiki of Kasi heard: ‘It seems that the Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, has reached Benares and
is living in the Deer Park at Isipatana.’ So he had a number of
state carriages made ready, and mounting a state carriage, drove out
from Benares with the full pomp of royalty in order to see the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened. He went thus
as far as the road was passable for carriages, and then he got down
from his carriage and went forward on foot to the Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened. After paying homage to
him, he sat down at one side and the Blessed One Kassapa,
accomplished and fully enlightened, instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged King Kiki of Kasi with an exposition of the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >15.
“At the conclusion of the exposition, King Kiki of Kasi said: [50]
‘Venerable sir, let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of
bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from me.’ And the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, accepted in
silence. Then, knowing that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and
fully enlightened, had accepted, he rose from his seat and after
paying homage to him, keeping him on his right, he departed.</P>
<P  >16.
“Then, when the night had ended, King Kiki of Kasi had good food of
various kinds prepared in his own dwelling - red rice stored in the
sheaf with the dark grains picked out, along with many sauces and
curries - and he had the time announced to the Blessed One Kassapa,
accomplished and fully enlightened, thus: ‘It is time, venerable
sir, the meal is ready.’</P>
<P  >17.
“Then, it being morning, the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and
fully enlightened, dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he
went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the dwelling of King Kiki of Kasi
and sat down on the seat made ready. Then, with his own hands, King
Kiki of Kasi served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by
the Buddha with the various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, had eaten and had
withdrawn his hand from the bowl, King Kiki of Kasi took a low seat,
sat down at one side and said: ‘Venerable sir, let the Blessed One
accept from me a residence for the Rains in Benares; that will be
helpful for the Sangha.’ -’Enough, king, my residence for the
Rains has already been provided for.’</P>
<P  >“A
second and a third time King Kiki of Kasi said: ‘Venerable sir, let
the Blessed One accept from. me a residence for the Rains in Benares;
that will be helpful for the Sangha.’ -’Enough, king, my
residence for the Rains has already been provided for.’</P>
<P  >“The
king thought: ‘The Blessed One Kassapa, [51] accomplished and fully
enlightened, does not accept from me a residence for the Rains in
Benares,’ and he was very disappointed and sad.</P>
<P  >18.
“Then he said: ‘Venerable sir, have you a better supporter than I
am?’ - ‘I have, great king. There is a market town called
Vebhalinga where a potter named Ghatikara lives. He is my supporter,
my chief supporter. Now you, great king, thought: “The Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, does not accept from me
a residence for the Rains in Benares,” and you were very
disappointed and sad; but the potter Ghatikara is not and will not be
so. The potter Ghatikara has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the
Dhamma, and the Sangha. He abstains from killing living beings, from
taking what is not given, from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from
false speech, and from wine, liquor, and intoxicants, which are the
basis of negligence. He has perfect confidence in the Buddha, the
Dhamma, and the Sangha, and he possesses the virtues loved by noble
ones. He is free from doubt about suffering, about the origin of
suffering, about the cessation of suffering, and about the way
leading to the cessation of suffering. He eats only in one part of
the day, he observes celibacy, he is virtuous, of good character. He
has laid aside gems and gold, he has given up gold and silver. He
does not dig the ground for clay using a pick with his own hand; what
is left over from embankments or thrown up by rats, he brings home in
a carrier; when he has made a pot he says: “Let anyone who likes
set down some selected rice or selected beans or selected lentils,
and let him take away whatever he likes.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote794anc" HREF="#sdendnote794sym"><SUP>dccxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
He supports his blind and aged parents. [52] Having destroyed the
five lower fetters, he is one who will reappear spontaneously [in the
Pure Abodes] and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning
from that world.</P>
<P  >19.
“‘On one occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga, it being
morning, I dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe, I went to the
potter Ghatikara’s parents and asked them: “Where has the potter
gone, please?” - “Venerable sir, your supporter has gone out; but
take rice from the cauldron and sauce from the saucepan and eat.”</P>
<P  >“‘I
did so and went away. Then the potter Ghatikara went to his parents
and asked: “Who has taken rice from the cauldron and sauce from the
saucepan, eaten and gone away?” - “My dear, the Blessed One
Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, did.”</P>
<P  >“‘Then
the potter Ghatikara thought: “It is a gain for me, it is a great
gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, relies on me thus!” And rapture and happiness never
left him for a half-month or his parents for a week.</P>
<P  >20.
“‘On another occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga, it being
morning, I dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe, I went to the
potter Ghatikara’s parents and asked them: “Where has the potter
gone, please?” - “Venerable sir, your supporter has gone out; but
take some porridge from the vessel and sauce from the saucepan and
eat.”</P>
<P  >“‘I
did so [53] and went away. Then the potter Ghatikara went to his
parents and asked: “Who has taken porridge from the vessel and
sauce from the saucepan, eaten and gone away?” - “My dear, the
Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, did.”</P>
<P  >“‘Then
the potter Ghatikara thought: “It is a gain for me, it is a great
gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, relies on me thus!” And rapture and happiness never
left him for a half-month or his parents for a week.</P>
<P  >21.
“‘On another occasion when I was living at Vebhalinga my hut
leaked. Then I addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Go, bhikkhus, and find
out if there is any grass at the potter Ghatikara’s house.” -
“Venerable sir, there is no grass at the potter Ghatikara’s
house; there is the grass thatch on his roof.” - “Go, bhikkhus,
and remove the grass from the potter Ghatikara’s house.”</P>
<P  >“‘They
did so. Then the potter Ghatikara’s parents asked the bhikkhus:
“Who is removing the grass from the house?” - “Sister, the hut
of the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, is
leaking.” - “Take it, venerable sirs, take it and bless you!”</P>
<P  >“‘Then
the potter Ghatikara went to his parents and asked: “Who has
removed the grass from the roof?” - “The bhikkhus did, my dear;
the hut of the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, is leaking.”</P>
<P  >“‘Then
the potter Ghatikara thought: “It is a gain for me, it is a great
gain for me that the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully
enlightened, relies on me thus!” And [54] the rapture and happiness
never left him for a half-month or his parents for a week. Then that
house remained three whole months with the sky for a roof, and yet no
rain came in. Such is the potter Ghatikara.’</P>
<P  >“‘It
is a gain for the potter Ghatikara, it is a great gain for him that
the Blessed One Kassapa, accomplished and fully enlightened, relies
on him thus.’</P>
<P  >22.
“Then King Kiki of Kasi dispatched to the potter Ghatikara five
hundred cartloads of red rice stored in the sheaf, and also sauce
materials to go with it. Then the king’s men went to the potter
Ghatikara and told him: ‘Venerable sir, there are five hundred
cartloads of red rice stored in the sheaf, and also sauce materials
to go with it, dispatched to you by King Kiki of Kasi; please accept
them.’ - ‘The king is very busy and has much to do. I have
enough. Let this be for the king himself.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote795anc" HREF="#sdendnote795sym"><SUP>dccxcv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
“Now, Ananda, you may think thus: ‘Certainly, someone else was
the brahmin student Jotipala on that occasion.’ But it should not
be regarded thus. I was the brahmin student Jotipala on that
occasion.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading83"  >
82. Ratthapala Sutta - On Ratthapala</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Kuru country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually he
arrived at a Kuru town named Thullakotthita.</P>
<P  >2.
The brahmin householders of Thullakotthita heard: “The recluse
Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has
been wandering in the Kuru country [55] with a large Sangha of
bhikkhus and has come to Thullakotthita. Now a good report of Master
Gotama has been spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He
declares this world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this
generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its
people, which he has himself realised with direct knowledge. He
teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning, good in the middle, and
good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals
a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure.’ Now it is good to
see such arahants.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then the brahmin householders of Thullakotthita went to the Blessed
One. Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side;
some exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their
hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down
at one side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One’s
presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at
one side. When they were seated, the Blessed One instructed, urged,
roused, and encouraged them with talk on the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >4.
Now at that time a clansman named Ratthapala, the son of the leading
clan in that same Thullakotthita, was sitting in the assembly. Then
it occurred to him: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the
Blessed One, it is not easy while living in a home to lead the holy
life, utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave
off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the
home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then the brahmin householders of Thullakotthita, having been
instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by the Blessed One with
talk on the Dhamma, delighted and rejoiced in his words. They then
rose from their [56] seats, and after paying homage to him, they
departed, keeping him on their right.</P>
<P  >6.
Soon after they had gone, the clansman Ratthapala went to the Blessed
One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said
to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, as I understand the Dhamma
taught by the Blessed One, it is not easy while living in a home to
lead the holy life, utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.
Venerable sir, I wish to shave off my hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness. I
would receive the going forth under the Blessed One, I would receive
the full admission.”</P>
<P  >“Have
you been permitted by your parents, Ratthapala, to go forth from the
home life into homelessness?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir, I have not been permitted by my parents.”</P>
<P  >“Ratthapala,
Tathagatas do not give the going forth to anyone who does not have
his parents’ permission.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I shall see to it that my parents permit me to go forth from the
home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >7.
Then the clansman Ratthapala rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to the Blessed One, he departed, keeping him on his right. He
went to his parents and told them: “Mother and father, as I
understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is not easy while
living in a home to lead the holy life, utterly perfect and pure as a
polished shell. I wish to shave off my hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness. Give
me permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >When
he had said this, his parents replied: “Dear Ratthapala, you are
our only son, dear and beloved. You have been raised in comfort,
brought up in comfort; you know nothing of suffering, dear
Ratthapala. [57] Even in case of your death we would lose you
unwillingly, so how could we give you our permission to go forth from
the home life into homelessness while you are still living?”</P>
<P  >For
the second time … For the third time the clansman Ratthapala said
to his parents: “Mother and father … give me permission to go
forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >For
the third time his parents replied: “Dear Ratthapala … how could
we give you our permission to go forth from the home life into
homelessness while you are still living?”</P>
<P  >Then,
not receiving his parents’ permission to go forth, the clansman
Ratthapala lay down there on the bare floor, saying:</P>
<P  >“Right
here I shall either die or receive the going forth.” [58]</P>
<P  >8.
Then the clansman Ratthapala’s parents said to him: “Dear
Ratthapala, you are our only son, dear and beloved. You have been
raised in comfort, brought up in comfort; you know nothing of
suffering, dear Ratthapala. Get up, dear Ratthapala, eat, drink, and
amuse yourself. While eating, drinking, and amusing yourself, you can
be happy enjoying sensual pleasures and making merit. We do not
permit you to go forth from the home life into homelessness. Even in
the case of your death we would lose you unwillingly, so how could we
give you our permission to go forth from the home life into
homelessness while you are still living?” When this was said, the
clansman Ratthapala was silent.</P>
<P  >For
the second time … For the third time his parents said to him: “Dear
Ratthapala … how could we give you our permission to go forth from
the home life into homelessness while you are still living?” For
the third time the clansman Ratthapala was silent.</P>
<P  >9.
Then the clansman Ratthapala’s parents went to his friends and said
to them: “Dears, the clansman Ratthapala has lain down on the bare
floor, having said: ‘Right here I shall either die or receive the
going forth.’ Come, dears, go to the clansman Ratthapala and say to
him: ‘Friend Ratthapala, you are your parents’ only son … Get
up, friend Ratthapala, eat, drink, and amuse yourself … [59] how
could your parents give you their permission to go forth from the
home life into homelessness while you are still living?’“</P>
<P  >10.
Then the clansman Ratthapala’s friends went to him and said:
“Friend Ratthapala, you are your parents’ only son, dear and
beloved. You have been raised in comfort, brought up in comfort; you
know nothing of suffering, friend Ratthapala. Get up, friend
Ratthapala, eat, drink, and amuse yourself. While eating, drinking,
and amusing yourself, you can be happy enjoying sensual pleasures and
making merit. Your parents do not permit you to go forth from the
home life into homelessness. Even in case of your death they would
lose you unwillingly, so how could they give you their permission to
go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still
living?” When this was said, the clansman Ratthapala was silent.</P>
<P  >For
the second time … For the third time his friends said to him:
“Friend Ratthapala … how could they give you their permission to
go forth from the home life into homelessness while you are still
living?” For the third time the clansman Ratthapala was silent.</P>
<P  >11.
Then the clansman Ratthapala’s friends went to his parents and said
to them: “Mother and father, the clansman Ratthapala is lying down
there on the bare floor, having said: ‘Right here I shall either
die or [60] get the going forth.’ Now if you do not give him your
permission to go forth from the home life into homelessness, he will
die there. But if you give him your permission, you will see him
after he has gone forth. And if he does not enjoy the going forth,
what else can he do then but return here? So give him your permission
to go forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
dears, we give the clansman Ratthapala permission to go forth from
thehome life into homelessness. But when he has gone forth, he must
visit his parents.”</P>
<P  >Then
the clansman Ratthapala’s friends went to him and told him: “Get
up, friend Ratthapala. Your parents permit you to go forth from the
home life into homelessness. But when you have gone forth, you must
visit your parents.”</P>
<P  >12.
The clansman Ratthapala then got up, and when he had regained his
strength, he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him,
he sat down at one side and told him: “Venerable sir, I have my
parents’ permission to go forth from the home life into
homelessness. Let the Blessed One give me the going forth.” Then
the clansman Ratthapala received the going forth under the Blessed
One, and he received the full admission.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote796anc" HREF="#sdendnote796sym"><SUP>dccxcvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
Then not long after the venerable Ratthapala had received the full
admission, a half-month after he had received the full</P>
<P  >admission,
the Blessed One, having stayed at Thullakotthita as long as he chose,
set out to wander towards Savatthi. Wandering by stages, he
eventually arrived at Savatthi, and there [61] he lived at Savatthi
in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >14.
Before long, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and
resolute, the venerable Ratthapala, by realising for himself with
direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that
supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly
go forth from the home life into homelessness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote797anc" HREF="#sdendnote797sym"><SUP>dccxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
He directly knew: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being.” And the venerable Ratthapala became one of the
arahants.</P>
<P  >15.
Then the venerable Ratthapala went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told him:
“Venerable sir, I wish to visit my parents, if I have the Blessed
One’s permission.”</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One penetrated mentally the thoughts in venerable
Ratthapala’s mind. When he knew that the clansman Ratthapala was
incapable of abandoning the training and returning to the low life,
he told him: “Now is the time, Ratthapala, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >16.
Then the venerable Ratthapala rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to the Blessed One, he departed, keeping him on his right. He
then set his resting place in order, and taking his bowl and outer
robe, set out to wander towards Thullakotthita. Wandering by stages,
he eventually arrived at Thullakotthita. There he lived in
Thullakotthita in King Koravya’s Migacira Garden. Then, when it was
morning, he dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into
Thullakotthita for alms. As he was wandering for alms from house to
house in Thullakotthita, he came to his own father’s house.</P>
<P  >17.
Now on that occasion the venerable Ratthapala’s father was sitting
in the hall of the central door having his hair dressed. When he saw
the venerable Ratthapala coming in the distance, he said: “Our only
son, dear and beloved, was made to go forth by these bald-pated
recluses.” [62] Then at his own father’s house the venerable
Ratthapala received neither alms nor a polite refusal; instead, he
received only abuse.</P>
<P  >18.
Just then a slavewoman belonging to one of his relatives was about to
throw away some old porridge.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote798anc" HREF="#sdendnote798sym"><SUP>dccxcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Seeing this, the venerable Ratthapala said to her: “Sister, if that
stuff is to be thrown away, then pour it into my bowl here.”</P>
<P  >While
she was doing so, she recognised the characteristic features of his
hands, his feet, and his voice. Then she went to his mother and said:
“Please know, my lady, that my lord’s son Ratthapala has
arrived.”</P>
<P  >“Gracious!
If what you say is true, you are no longer a slave!”</P>
<P  >Then
the venerable Ratthapala’s mother went to his father and said:
“Please know, householder, they say that the clansman Ratthapala
has arrived.”</P>
<P  >19.
Just then the venerable Ratthapala was eating the old porridge by the
wall of a certain shelter. His father went to him and said:
“Ratthapala, my dear, surely there is … and you will be eating
old porridge!<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote799anc" HREF="#sdendnote799sym"><SUP>dccxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
Is there not your own house to go to?”</P>
<P  >“How
could we have a house, householder, when we have gone forth from the
home life into homelessness? We are homeless, householder. We went
[63] to your house, but we received neither alms nor a polite refusal
there; instead we received only abuse.”</P>
<P  >“Come,
dear Ratthapala, let us go to the house.”</P>
<P  >“Enough,
householder, my meal for today is finished.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
dear Ratthapala, consent to accept tomorrow’s meal.” The
venerable Ratthapala consented in silence.</P>
<P  >20.
Then, knowing that the venerable Ratthapala had consented, his father
went back to his own house where he had gold coins and bullion made
into a large heap and covered it with mats. Then he told the
venerable Ratthapala’s former wives: “Come, daughters-in-law,
adorn yourselves with ornaments in the way Ratthapala found you most
dear and loveable.”</P>
<P  >21.
When night had ended, the venerable Ratthapala’s father had good
food of various kinds prepared in his own house and had the time
announced to the venerable Ratthapala: “It is time, dear
Ratthapala, the meal is ready.”</P>
<P  >22.
Then, it being morning, the venerable Ratthapala dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, he went to his own father’s house and sat
down on the seat made ready. Then his father had the pile of gold
coins and bullion uncovered and said: “Dear Ratthapala, this is
your maternal fortune; your paternal fortune is another and your
ancestral fortune is yet another. Dear Ratthapala, you can enjoy the
wealth and make merit. Come then, dear, [64] abandon the training and
return to the low life, enjoy the wealth and make merit.”</P>
<P  >“Householder,
if you would follow my advice, then have this pile of gold coins and
bullion loaded on carts and carried away to be dumped midstream in
the river Ganges. Why is that? Because, householder, on account of
this there will arise for you sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair.”</P>
<P  >23.
Then the venerable Ratthapala’s former wives clasped his feet and
said to him: “What are they like, my lord’s son, the nymphs for
whose sake you lead the holy life?”</P>
<P  >“We
do not lead the holy life for the sake of nymphs, sisters.”</P>
<P  >“Our
lord’s son Ratthapala calls us ‘sisters,’“they cried and
right there they fainted.</P>
<P  >24.
Then the venerable Ratthapala told his father: “Householder, if
there is a meal to be given, then give it. Do not harass us.”</P>
<P  >“Eat
then, dear Ratthapala, the meal is ready.”</P>
<P  >Then,
with his own hands, the venerable Ratthapala’s father served and
satisfied him with the various kinds of good food. When the venerable
Ratthapala had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, he
stood up and uttered these stanzas:</P>
<P  >25.
“Behold a puppet here pranked out<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote800anc" HREF="#sdendnote800sym"><SUP>dccc</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
A body built up out of sores,</P>
<P >
Sick, an object for concern,</P>
<P >
Where no stability abides.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Behold a figure here pranked out</P>
<P >
With jewellery and earrings too,</P>
<P >
A skeleton wrapped up in skin,</P>
<P >
Made attractive by its clothes.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Its feet adorned with henna dye</P>
<P >
And powder smeared upon its face:</P>
<P >
It may beguile a fool, but not</P>
<P >
A seeker of the further shore. [65]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Its hair is dressed in eightfold plaits</P>
<P >
And unguent smeared upon its eyes:</P>
<P >
It may beguile a fool, but not</P>
<P >
A seeker of the further shore.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
A filthy body well adorned</P>
<P >
Like a new-painted unguent pot:</P>
<P >
It may beguile a fool, but not</P>
<P >
A seeker of the further shore.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
The deer-hunter set out the snare</P>
<P >
But the deer did not spring the trap;</P>
<P >
We ate the bait and now depart</P>
<P >
Leaving the hunters to lament.”</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >26.
After the venerable Ratthapala had stood up and uttered these
stanzas, he went to King Koravya’s Migacira garden and sat down at
the root of a tree for the day’s abiding.</P>
<P  >27.
Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper thus: “Good gamekeeper,
tidy up the Migacira Garden so that we may go to the pleasure garden
to see a pleasing spot.” - “Yes, sire,” he replied. Now while
he was tidying up the Migacira Garden, the gamekeeper saw the
venerable Ratthapala seated at the root of a tree for the day’s
abiding. When he saw him, he went to King Koravya and told him:
“Sire, the Migacira Garden has been tidied up. The clansman
Ratthapala is there, the son of the leading clan in this same
Thullakotthita, of whom you have always spoken highly;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote801anc" HREF="#sdendnote801sym"><SUP>dccci</SUP></A></SUP>
he is seated at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
good Migava, enough of the pleasure garden for today. Now we shall go
to pay respects to that Master Ratthapala.”</P>
<P  >28.
Then, saying: “Give away all the food that has been prepared
there,” King Koravya had a number of state carriages prepared, and
mounting one of them, accompanied by the other carriages, he drove
out from Thullakotthita with the full pomp of royalty to see the
venerable Ratthapala. He drove thus as far as the road was passable
for carriages, and then he dismounted from his carriage and went
forward on foot with a following of the most eminent officials to
where the venerable Ratthapala was. [66] He exchanged greetings with
the venerable Ratthapala, and when this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he stood at one side and said: “Here is an elephant
rug. Let Master Ratthapala be seated on it.”</P>
<P  >“There
is no need, great king. Sit down. I am sitting on my own mat.”</P>
<P  >King
Koravya sat down on a seat made ready and said:</P>
<P  >29.
“Master Ratthapala, there are four kinds of loss. Because they have
undergone these four kinds of loss, some people here shave off their
hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home
life into homelessness. What are the four? They are loss through
ageing, loss through sickness, loss of wealth, and loss of relatives.</P>
<P  >30.
“And what is loss through ageing? Here, Master Ratthapala, someone
is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last
stage. He considers thus: ‘I am old, aged, burdened with years,
advanced in life, come to the last stage. It is no longer easy for me
to acquire unacquired wealth or to augment wealth already acquired.
Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go
forth from the home life into homelessness.’ Because he has
undergone that loss through ageing, he shaves off his hair and beard,
puts on the yellow robe, and goes forth from the home life into
homelessness. This is called loss through ageing. But Master
Ratthapala is now still young, a black-haired young man endowed with
the blessing of youth, in the prime of life. Master Ratthapala has
not undergone any loss through ageing. What has he known or seen or
heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness?</P>
<P  >31.
“And what is loss through sickness? Here, Master Ratthapala,
someone is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill. He considers thus:
‘I am afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill. It is no longer easy
for me to acquire unacquired wealth … [67] … into homelessness.’
Because he has undergone that loss through sickness.. .he goes forth
from the home life into homelessness. This is called loss through
sickness. But Master Ratthapala now is free from illness and
affliction; he possesses a good digestion that is neither too cool
nor too warm but medium. Master Ratthapala has not undergone any loss
through sickness. What has he known or seen or heard that he has gone
forth from the home life into homelessness?</P>
<P  >32.
“And what is loss of wealth? Here, Master Ratthapala, someone is
rich, of great wealth, of great possessions. Gradually his wealth
dwindles away. He considers thus: ‘Formerly I was rich, of great
wealth, of great possessions. Gradually my wealth has dwindled away.
It is no longer easy for me to</P>
<P  >acquire
unacquired wealth … into homelessness.’ Because he has undergone
that loss of wealth … he goes forth from the home life into
homelessness. This is called loss of wealth. But Master Ratthapala is
the son of the leading clan in this same Thullakotthita. Master
Ratthapala has not undergone any loss of wealth. What has he known or
seen or heard that he has gone forth from the home life into
homelessness?</P>
<P  >33.
“And what is loss of relatives? Here, Master Ratthapala, someone
has many friends and companions, kinsmen and relatives. Gradually
those relatives of his dwindle away. He considers thus: ‘Formerly I
had many friends and companions, kinsmen and relatives. Gradually
those relatives of mine have dwindled away. It is no longer easy for
me to acquire unacquired wealth … [68] … into homelessness.’
Because he has undergone that loss of relatives … he goes forth
from the home life into homelessness. This is called loss of
relatives. But Master Ratthapala has many friends and companions,
kinsmen and relatives, in this same Thullakotthita. Master Ratthapala
has not undergone any loss of relatives. What has he known or seen or
heard that he has gone forth from the home life into homelessness?</P>
<P  >34.
“Master Ratthapala, these are the four kinds of loss. Because they
have undergone these four kinds of loss, some people here shave off
their hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the
home life into homelessness. Master Ratthapala has not undergone any
of these. What has he known or seen or heard that he has gone forth
from the home life into homelessness?”</P>
<P  >35.
“Great king, there are four summaries of the Dhamma that have been
taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully
enlightened. Knowing and seeing and hearing them, I went forth from
the home life into homelessness. What are the four?</P>
<P  >36.
(1) “‘[Life in] any world is unstable, it is swept away’:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote802anc" HREF="#sdendnote802sym"><SUP>dcccii</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the first summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who
knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened. Knowing and
seeing and hearing this, I went forth from the home life into
homelessness.</P>
<P  >(2)
“‘[Life in] any world has no shelter and no protector’:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote803anc" HREF="#sdendnote803sym"><SUP>dccciii</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the second summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One
who knows and sees …</P>
<P  >(3)
“‘[Life in] any world has nothing of its own; one has to leave
all and pass on’:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote804anc" HREF="#sdendnote804sym"><SUP>dccciv</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the third summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One who
knows and sees …</P>
<P  >(4)
“‘[Life in] any world is incomplete, insatiate, the slave of
craving’:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote805anc" HREF="#sdendnote805sym"><SUP>dcccv</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the fourth summary of the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One
who knows and sees …</P>
<P  >37.
“Great king, these are the four summaries of the Dhamma that have
been taught by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and
fully enlightened. [69] Knowing and seeing and hearing them, I went
forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >38.
“Master Ratthapala said: ‘[Life in] any world is unstable, it is
swept away.’ How should the meaning of that statement be
understood?”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? When you were twenty or twenty-five years
old, were you an expert rider of elephants, an expert horseman, an
expert charioteer, an expert archer, an expert swordsman, strong in
thighs and arms, sturdy, capable in battle?”</P>
<P  >“When
I was twenty or twenty-five years old, Master Ratthapala, I was an
expert rider of elephants … strong in thighs and arms, sturdy,
capable in battle. Sometimes I wonder if I had supernormal power
then. I do not see anyone who could equal me in strength.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Are you now as strong in thighs and arms,
as sturdy and as capable in battle?”</P>
<P  >“No,
Master Ratthapala. Now I am old, aged, burdened with years, advanced
in life, come to the last stage; my years have turned eighty.
Sometimes I mean to put my foot here and I put my foot somewhere
else.”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: ‘[Life in] any
world is unstable, it is swept away’; and when I knew and saw and
heard this, I went forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >“It
is wonderful, Master Ratthapala, it is marvellous how well that has
been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished
and fully enlightened: ‘[Life in] any world is unstable, it is
swept away.’ It is indeed so!</P>
<P  >39.
“Master Ratthapala, there exist in this court elephant troops and
cavalry and chariot troops and infantry, which will serve to subdue
any threats to us. [70] Now Master Ratthapala said: ‘[Life in] any
world has no shelter and no protector.’ How should the meaning of
that statement be understood?”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Do you have any chronic ailment?”</P>
<P  >“I
have a chronic wind ailment, Master Ratthapala. Sometimes my friends
and companions, kinsmen, and relatives, stand around me, thinking:
‘Now King Koravya is about to die, now King Koravya is about to
die!’“</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Can you command your friends and
companions, your kinsmen and relatives: ‘Come, my good friends and
companions, my kinsmen and relatives. All of you present share this
painful feeling so that I may feel less pain’? Or do you have to
feel that pain yourself alone?”</P>
<P  >“I
cannot command my friends and companions, my kinsmen and relatives
thus, Master Ratthapala. I have to feel that pain alone.”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: ‘[Life in] any
world has no shelter and no protector’; and when I knew and saw and
heard this, I went forth from the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >“It
is wonderful, Master Ratthapala, it is marvellous how well that has
been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished
and fully enlightened: ‘[Life in] any world has no shelter and no
protector.’ It is indeed so!</P>
<P  >40.
“Master Ratthapala, there exist in this court abundant gold coins
and bullion stored away in vaults and depositories. Now Master
Ratthapala said: ‘[Life in] any world has nothing of its own; one
has to leave all and pass on.’ How should the meaning of that
statement be understood?”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? You now [71] enjoy yourself provided and
endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure, but will you be able
to have it of the life to come: ‘Let me likewise enjoy myself
provided and endowed with these same five cords of sensual pleasure’?
Or will others take over this property, while you will have to pass
on according to your actions?”</P>
<P  >“I
cannot have it thus of the life to come, Master Ratthapala. On the
contrary, others will take over this property while I shall have to
pass on according to my actions.”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: ‘[Life in] any
world has nothing of its own; one has to leave all and pass on’;
and when I knew and saw and heard this, I went forth from the home
life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >“It
is wonderful, Master Ratthapala, it is marvellous how well that has
been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished
and fully enlightened: ‘[Life in] any world has nothing of its own;
one has to leave all and pass on.’ It is indeed so!</P>
<P  >41.
“Now Master Ratthapala said: ‘[Life in] any world is incomplete,
insatiate, the slave of craving.’ How should the meaning of that
statement be understood?”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Do you reign over the rich Kuru country?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
Master Ratthapala, I do.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man came
to you from the east and said: ‘Please know, great king, that I
have come from the east, and there I saw a large country, powerful
and rich, very populous and crowded with people. There are plenty of
elephant troops there, plenty of cavalry, chariot troops and
infantry; there is plenty of ivory there, and plenty of gold coins
and bullion both unworked and worked, and plenty of women for wives.
With your present forces you can conquer it. Conquer it then, great
king.’ What would you do?” [72]</P>
<P  >“We
would conquer it and reign over it, Master Ratthapala.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man came
to you from the west … from the north … from the south and said:
‘Please know, great king, that I have come from the south, and
there I saw a large country, powerful and rich … Conquer it then,
great king.’ What would you do?”</P>
<P  >“We
would conquer it too and reign over it, Master Ratthapala.”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: ‘[Life in] any
world is incomplete, insatiate, the slave of craving’; and when I
knew and saw and heard this, I went forth from the home life into
homelessness.”</P>
<P  >“It
is wonderful, Master Ratthapala, it is marvellous how well that has
been expressed by the Blessed One who knows and</P>
<P  >sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened: ‘[Life in] any world is
incomplete, insatiate, the slave of craving.’ It is indeed so!”</P>
<P  >42.
That is what the venerable Ratthapala said. And having said that he
said further:</P>
<P >
“I see men wealthy in the world, who yet</P>
<P >
From ignorance give not their gathered wealth.</P>
<P >
Greedily they hoard away their riches</P>
<P >
Longing still for further sensual pleasures.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
A king who has conquered the earth by force</P>
<P >
And rules over the land the ocean bounds</P>
<P >
Is yet unsated with the sea’s near shore</P>
<P >
And hungers for its further shore as well. [73]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Most other people too, not just a king,</P>
<P >
Encounter death with craving unabated;</P>
<P >
[With plans] still incomplete they leave the corpse;</P>
<P >
Desires remain unsated in the world.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
His relatives lament and rend their hair,</P>
<P >
Crying, ‘Ah me! Alas! Our love is dead!’</P>
<P >
They bear away the body wrapped in shrouds</P>
<P >
To place it on a pyre and burn it there.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Clad in a shroud, he leaves his wealth behind,</P>
<P >
Prodded with stakes he burns [upon the pyre].</P>
<P >
And as he dies, no relatives or friends</P>
<P >
Can offer him shelter and refuge here.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
While his heirs take over his wealth, this being</P>
<P >
Must pass on according to his actions;</P>
<P >
And as he dies nothing can follow him;</P>
<P >
Not child nor wife nor wealth nor royal estate.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Longevity is not acquired with wealth</P>
<P >
Nor can prosperity banish old age;</P>
<P >
Short is this life, as all the sages say,</P>
<P >
Eternity it knows not, only change.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
The rich and poor alike shall feel [Death’s] touch,</P>
<P >
The fool and sage as well shall feel it too;</P>
<P >
But while the fool lies stricken by his folly,</P>
<P >
No sage will ever tremble at the touch.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Better is wisdom here than any wealth,</P>
<P >
Since by wisdom one gains the final goal.</P>
<P >
For people through ignorance do evil deeds</P>
<P >
While failing to reach the goal from life to life.</P>
<P >

</P>
<P >
As one goes to the womb and the next world,</P>
<P >
Renewing the successive round of births,</P>
<P >
Another of little wisdom, trusting him,</P>
<P >
Goes also to the womb and the next world. [74]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Just as a robber caught in burglary</P>
<P >
Is made to suffer for his evil deed,</P>
<P >
So people after death, in the next world,</P>
<P >
Are made to suffer for their evil deeds.</P>

Sensual pleasures, varied, sweet, delightful,</P>

In many different ways disturb the mind:</P>

Seeing the danger in these sensual ties</P>

I chose to lead the homeless life, O King.</P>

<P >
As fruits fall from the tree, so people too,</P>

Both young and old, fall when this body breaks.</P>

Better is the recluse’s life assured.”</P>

83. Makhadeva Sutta - King Makhadeva</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote806anc" HREF="#sdendnote806sym"><SUP>dcccvi</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion, the Blessed One was living at Mithila in the
Makhadeva Mango Grove.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote807anc" HREF="#sdendnote807sym"><SUP>dcccvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Then in a certain place the Blessed One smiled. It occurred to the
venerable Ananda: “What is the reason, what is the cause, for the
Blessed One’s smile? Tathagatas do not smile for no reason.” So
he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands
in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, he asked him:
“Venerable sir, what is the reason, what is the cause, for the
Blessed One’s smile? Tathagatas do not smile for no reason.”</P>
<P  >3.
“Once, Ananda, in this same Mithila there was a king named
Makhadeva. He was a righteous king who ruled by the Dhamma, a great
king who was established in the Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote808anc" HREF="#sdendnote808sym"><SUP>dcccviii</SUP></A></SUP>
He conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders,
among town-dwellers and countryfolk, and he observed the Uposatha
days [75] on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote809anc" HREF="#sdendnote809sym"><SUP>dcccix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
“Now at the end of many years, many hundred years, many thousand
years, King Makhadeva addressed his barber thus: ‘Good barber, when
you see any grey hairs growing on my head, then tell me.’ - ‘Yes,
sire,’ he replied. And after many years, many hundred years, many
thousand years, the barber saw grey hairs growing on King Makhadeva’s
head.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote810anc" HREF="#sdendnote810sym"><SUP>dcccx</SUP></A></SUP>
When he saw them, he said to the king: ‘The divine messengers have
appeared, sire; grey hairs are to be seen growing on your majesty’s
head.’ - ‘Then, good barber, pull out those grey hairs carefully
with tweezers and put them in my palm.’ -’Yes, sire,’ he
replied, and he pulled out those grey hairs carefully with tweezers
and put them in the king’s palm.</P>
<P  >“Then
King Makhadeva gave the best township to his barber, and calling the
prince, his eldest son, he said: ‘Dear prince, the divine
messengers have appeared;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote811anc" HREF="#sdendnote811sym"><SUP>dcccxi</SUP></A></SUP>
grey hairs are seen growing on my head. I have enjoyed human sensual
pleasures; now it is time to seek divine sensual pleasures. Come,
dear prince, take over the kingship. I shall shave off my hair and
beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into
homelessness. And now, dear prince, when you too see grey hairs
growing on your head, then after giving the best township to your
barber, and after carefully instructing the prince, your eldest son,
in kingship, shave off your hair and beard, put on the yellow robe,
and go forth from the home life into homelessness. Continue this good
practice instituted by me and do not be the last man. Dear prince,
when there are two men living, he under whom there occurs a breach of
this good practice - he is the last man among them. Therefore, dear
prince, I say to you: Continue this good practice [76] instituted by
me and do not be the last man.’</P>
<P  >5.
“Then, after giving the best township to his barber and after
carefully instructing the prince, his eldest son, in kingship, in the
Makhadeva Mango Grove he shaved off his hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness.</P>
<P  >“He
abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness,
likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so
above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he
abided pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility
and without ill will.</P>
<P  >“He
abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion …
with a mind imbued with appreciative joy … with a mind imbued with
equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the
fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to
himself, he abided pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind
imbued with equanimity, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility and without ill will.</P>
<P  >6.
“For eighty-four thousand years King Makhadeva played childish
games; for eighty-four thousand years he acted as viceregent; for
eighty-four thousand years he governed the kingdom;</P>
<P  >for
eighty-four thousand years he led the holy life in this Makhadeva
Mango Grove after shaving off his hair and beard, putting on the

developing the four divine abodes, on the dissolution of the body,
after death, he passed on to the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >7-9.
“Now at the end of many years, many hundred years, many thousand
years, King Makhadeva’s son addressed his barber thus: … (as
above, §§4-6, reading “King Makhadeva’s son” throughout) …
[77, 78] … By developing the four divine abodes, on the dissolution
of the body, after death, he passed on to the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >10.
“The descendants of King Makhadeva’s son to the number of
eighty-four thousand kings in succession, after shaving off their
hair and beard and putting on the yellow robe, went forth from the
home life into homelessness in this Makhadeva Mango Grove. They
abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness
… with compassion … with appreciative joy … with equanimity …
without ill will.</P>
<P  >11.
“For eighty-four thousand years they played childish games; for
eighty-four thousand years they acted as viceregents; for eighty-four
thousand years they governed the kingdom; for eighty-four thousand
years they led the holy life in this Makhadeva Mango Grove after
shaving off their hair and beard, putting on the yellow robe, and
going forth from the home life into homelessness. By developing the
four divine abodes, on the dissolution of the body, after death, they
passed on to the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >12.
“Nimi was the last of those kings. He was a righteous king who
ruled by the Dhamma, a great king who was established in the Dhamma.
He conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders,
among town-dwellers and countryfolk, and he observed the Uposatha
days on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.</P>
<P  >13.
“Once, Ananda, when the gods of the Thirty-three [79] had met
together and were seated in the Sudhamma Assembly, this discussion
arose among them: ‘It is a gain, sirs, for the people of Videha, it
is a great gain for the people of Videha that their King Nimi is a
righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, a great king who is
established in the Dhamma. He conducts himself by the Dhamma among
brahmins and householders, among towndwellers and countryfolk, and he
observes the Uposatha days on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth
of the fortnight.’</P>
<P  >“Then
Sakka, ruler of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirtythree: ‘Good
sirs, do you want to see King Nimi?’ - ‘Good sir, we want to see
King Nimi.’</P>
<P  >“Now
on that occasion, it being the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, King
Nimi had washed his head and ascended to the upper palace chamber,
where he was seated for the Uposatha observance. Then, just as
quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his
extended arm, Sakka, ruler of gods, vanished among the gods of the
Thirty-three and appeared in the presence of King Nimi. He said: ‘It
is a gain for you, great king, it is a great gain for you, great
king. When the gods of the Thirty-three had met together and were
seated in the Sudhamma Assembly, this discussion arose among them:
“It is a gain, sirs, for the people of Videha … eighth of the
fortnight.” Great king, the gods want to see you. I shall send a
chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds for you, great king.
Great king, mount the divine chariot without misgiving.’</P>
<P  >“King
Nimi consented in silence. Then, just as quickly as a strong man
might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, Sakka, ruler of
gods, vanished in the presence of King Nimi and appeared among the
gods of the Thirty-three.</P>
<P  >14.
“Then Sakka, ruler of gods, addressed the charioteer Matali thus:
‘Come, good Matali, prepare a chariot harnessed to a thousand
thoroughbreds, and go to King Nimi and say: “Great king, this
chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds has been sent for you
by Sakka, ruler of gods. Great king, mount the divine [80] chariot
without misgiving.’“</P>
<P  >“‘May
your words be held sacred,’ the charioteer Matali replied. And
having prepared a chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds, he
went to King Nimi and said: ‘Great king, this chariot harnessed to
a thousand thoroughbreds has been sent for you by Sakka, ruler of
gods. Great king, mount the divine chariot without misgiving. But,
great king, by which route shall I drive you: by that on which doers
of evil experience the results of evil actions, or by that on which
doers of good experience the results of good actions?’ - ‘Drive
me by both routes, Matali.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote812anc" HREF="#sdendnote812sym"><SUP>dcccxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
“Matali brought King Nimi to the Sudhamma Assembly. Sakka, ruler of
gods, saw King Nimi coming in the distance and said to him: ‘Come,
great king! Welcome, great king! The gods of the Thirty-three, great
king, seated in the Sudhamma Assembly, have expressed themselves
thus: “It is a gain, sirs, for the people of Videha … eighth of
the fortnight.” Great king, the gods of the Thirty-three want to
see you. Great king, enjoy divine might among the gods.’</P>
<P  >“‘Enough,
good sir. Let the charioteer drive me back to Mithila. There I will
conduct myself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders, among
town-dwellers and countryfolk; there I will observe the Uposatha days
on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight.’</P>
<P  >16.
“Then Sakka, ruler of gods, told the charioteer Matali: ‘Come,
good Matali, prepare the chariot harnessed to a thousand
thoroughbreds and drive King Nimi back to Mithila.’</P>
<P  >“‘May
your word be held sacred,’ the charioteer Matali replied. And
having prepared the chariot harnessed to a thousand thoroughbreds, he
drove King Nimi back to Mithila. And there, indeed, King Nimi
conducted himself by the Dhamma among brahmins and householders,
among town-dwellers and countryfolk; and there [81] he observed the
Uposatha days on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the
fortnight.</P>
<P  >17-19.
“Then at the end of many years, many hundred years, many thousand
years, King Nimi addressed his barber thus: … (as above, §§4-6,
reading “King Nimi” throughout) … [82] … By developing the
four divine abodes, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he
passed on to the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >20.
“Now King Nimi had a son named Kalarajanaka. He did not go forth
from the home life into homelessness. He broke that good practice. He
was the last man among them.</P>
<P  >21.
“Now, Ananda, it may be that you think thus: ‘Certainly, someone
else was King Makhadeva on that occasion.’ But it should not be
regarded thus. I was King Makhadeva on that occasion. I instituted
that good practice and later generations continued that good practice
instituted by me. But that kind of good practice does not lead to
disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct
knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana, but only to reappearance in
the Brahma-world. But there is this kind of good practice that has
been instituted by me now, which leads to complete disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana. And what is that good practice? It is this
Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right
speech, right action, right livelihood, [83] right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration. This is the good practice
instituted by me now, which leads to complete disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana.</P>
<P  >“Ananda,
I say to you: continue this good practice instituted by me and do not
be the last man. Ananda, when there are two men living, he under whom
there occurs a breach of this good practice - he is the last man
among them. Therefore, Ananda, I say to you: continue this good
practice instituted by me and do not be the last man.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote813anc" HREF="#sdendnote813sym"><SUP>dcccxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

84. Madhura Sutta - At Madhura</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Maha Kaccana was
living at Madhura in the Gunda Grove.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote814anc" HREF="#sdendnote814sym"><SUP>dcccxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
King Avantiputta of Madhura heard: “The recluse Kaccana is living
at Madhura in the Gunda Grove. Now a good report of Master Kaccana
has been spread to this effect: ‘He is wise, discerning, sagacious,
learned, articulate, and perspicacious; he is aged and he is an
arahant. It is good to see such arahants.’“</P>
<P  >3.
Then King Avantiputta of Madhura had a number of state carriages made
ready, and mounting a state carriage, he drove out from Madhura with
the full pomp of royalty in order to see the venerable Maha Kaccana.
He went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages, and then
he got down from his carriage and went forward on foot to the
venerable Maha Kaccana. [84] He exchanged greetings with him, and
when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and said:</P>
<P  >4.
“Master Kaccana, the brahmins say thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest
caste, those of any other caste are inferior; brahmins are the
fairest caste, those of any other caste are dark; only brahmins are
purified, not non-brahmins; brahmins alone are the sons of Brahma,
the offspring of Brahma, born of his mouth, born of Brahma, created
by Brahma, heirs of Brahma.’ What does Master Kaccana say about
that?”</P>
<P  >5.
“It is just a saying in the world, great king, that ‘Brahmins are
the highest caste … heirs of Brahma.’ And there is a way whereby
it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a
saying in the world.</P>

When this was said, King Avantiputta of Madhura said to the venerable

what was hidden, showing the way to one who is lost, or holding up a

85. Bodhirajakumara Sutta - To Prince Bodhi</H2>
<P  >[91]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Bhagga country at Sutinsumaragira in the Bhesaka1a Grove, the
Deer Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a palace named Kokanada had recently been built
for Prince Bodhi, and it had not yet been inhabited by any recluse or
brahmin or any human being at all.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote816anc" HREF="#sdendnote816sym"><SUP>dcccxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin student Sanjikaputta thus:
“Come, my dear Sanjikaputta, go to the Blessed One and pay homage
in my name with your head at his feet, and ask whether he is free
from illness and affliction and is healthy, strong, and abiding in
comfort, saying: ‘Venerable sir, Prince Bodhi pays homage with his
head at the Blessed One’s feet, and he asks whether the Blessed One
is free from illness … and abiding in comfort.’ Then say this:
‘Venerable sir, let the Blessed One together with the Sangha of
bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from Prince Bodhi.’“</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir,” Sanjikaputta replied, and he went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he sat down at one side and said: “Master Gotama,
Prince Bodhi pays homage with his head at Master Gotama’s feet and
asks whether he is free from illness … and abiding in comfort. And
he says this: ‘Let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of
bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from Prince Bodhi.’“</P>
<P  >4.
The Blessed One consented in silence. Then, knowing that the Blessed
One had consented, Sanjikaputta rose from his seat, went to Prince
Bodhi, and told him what had happened [92], adding: “The recluse
Gotama has consented.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then, when the night had ended, Prince Bodhi had good food of various
kinds prepared in his own residence, and he had</P>
<P  >the
Kokanada Palace spread with white cloth down to the last step of the
staircase. Then he addressed the brahmin student Sanjikaputta thus:
“Come, my dear Sanjikaputta, go to the Blessed One and announce
that it is time thus: ‘It is time, venerable sir, the meal is
ready.’“</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir,” Sanjikaputta replied, and he went to the Blessed One and
announced that it was time thus: “It is time, Master Gotama, the
meal is ready.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then, it being morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl
and outer robe, went to Prince Bodhi’s residence.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion Prince Bodhi was standing in the outer porch
waiting for the Blessed One. When he saw the Blessed One coming in
the distance, he went out to meet him and paid homage to him; and
then, allowing the Blessed One to precede him, he proceeded to the
Kokanada Palace. But the Blessed One stopped at the lowest step of
the staircase. Prince Bodhi said to him: “Venerable sir, let the
Blessed One step on the cloth, let the Sublime One step on the cloth,
that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time.” When
this was said, the Blessed One was silent.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote817anc" HREF="#sdendnote817sym"><SUP>dcccxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >A
second time … A third time Prince Bodhi said to him: “Venerable
sir, let the Blessed One step on the cloth, let the Sublime One step
on the cloth, that it may lead to my welfare and happiness for a long
time.”</P>
<P  >The
Blessed One looked at the venerable Ananda. [93] The venerable Ananda
said to Prince Bodhi: “Prince, let the cloth be removed. The
Blessed One will not step on a strip of cloth; the Tathagata has
regard for future generations.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote818anc" HREF="#sdendnote818sym"><SUP>dcccxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
So Prince Bodhi had the cloth removed, and he had seats prepared in
the upper apartments of the Kokanada Palace. The Blessed One and the
Sangha of bhikkhus ascended the Kokanada Palace and sat down on the
seats that had been prepared.</P>
<P  >9.
Then, with his own hands, Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the
Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of
good food. When the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand
from the bowl, Prince Bodhi took a low seat, sat down at one side,
and said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, we have thought thus:
‘Pleasure is not to be gained through pleasure; pleasure is to be
gained through pain.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote819anc" HREF="#sdendnote819sym"><SUP>dcccxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >10.
“Prince, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an
unenlightened Bodhisatta, I too thought thus: ‘Pleasure is not to
be gained through pleasure; pleasure is to be gained through pain.’</P>
<P  >11-14.
“Later, prince, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed
with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life … (as Sutta 26,
§§15-17) … And I sat down there thinking: ‘This will serve for
striving.’</P>
<P  >15-42.
“Now three similes occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before
… (as Sutta 36, §§17-44, but in the present sutta in §§18-23 -
corresponding to §§20-25 of Sutta 36 - the sentence “But such
painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain”
does not occur; and in the present sutta in §§37, 39 and 42 -
corresponding to §§39, 41, and 44 of Sutta 36 - the sentence “But
such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and
remain” does not occur) … as happens in one who abides diligent,
ardent, and resolute.</P>
<P  >43-53.
“I considered: ‘This Dhamma that I have attained is profound’ …
(as Sutta 26, §§19-29) [94] … and the six of us lived on what
those two bhikkhus brought back from their almsround.</P>
<P  >54.
“Then the bhikkhus of the group of five, not long after being thus
taught and instructed by me, by realising for themselves with direct
knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal
of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from
the home life into homelessness.”</P>
<P  >55.
When this was said, Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One: “Venerable
sir, when a bhikkhu finds the Tathagata to discipline him, how long
is it until by realising for himself with direct knowledge, he here
and now enters upon and abides in that supreme goal of the holy life
for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life
into homelessness?”</P>
<P  >“As
to that, prince, I shall ask you a question in return. Answer it as
you choose. What do you think, prince? Are you skilled in the art of
wielding a goad while riding an elephant?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir, I am.”</P>
<P  >56.
“What do you think, prince? Suppose a man came here thinking:
‘Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a goad while riding an
elephant; I shall train in that art under him.’ If he had no faith,
he could not achieve what can be achieved by one who has faith; if he
had much illness, he could not achieve what can be achieved. by one
who is free from illness; if he was fraudulent and deceitful, he
could not achieve what can be achieved by one who is honest and
sincere; if he was lazy, he could not achieve what can be achieved by
one who is energetic; if he was not wise, he could not achieve what
can be achieved by one who is wise. What do you think, prince? Could
that man train under you in the art of wielding a goad while riding
an elephant?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, even if he had one of those deficiencies, he could not train
under me, so what of the five?”</P>
<P  >57.
“What do you think, prince? Suppose a man came here thinking: [95]
‘Prince Bodhi knows the art of wielding a goad while riding an
elephant; I shall train in that art under him.’ If he had faith, he
could achieve what can be achieved by one who has faith; if he was
free from illness, he could achieve what can be achieved by one who
is free from illness; if he was honest and sincere, he could achieve
what can be achieved by one who is honest and sincere; if he was
energetic, he could achieve what can be achieved by one who is
energetic; if he was wise, he could achieve what can be achieved by
one who is wise. What do you think, prince? Could that man train
under you in the art of wielding a goad while riding an elephant?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, even if he had one of those qualities he could train under me,
so what of the five?”</P>
<P  >58.
“So too, prince, there are these five factors of striving. What
five? Here a bhikkhu has faith, he places his faith in the
Tathagata’s enlightenment thus: ‘That Blessed One is
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’</P>
<P  >“Then
he is free from illness and affliction, possessing a good digestion
that is neither too cool nor too warm but medium and able to bear the
strain of striving.</P>
<P  >“Then
he is honest and sincere, and shows himself as he actually is to the
Teacher and his companions in the holy life.</P>
<P  >“Then
he is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking
wholesome states, steadfast, launching his effort with firmness and
persevering in cultivating wholesome states.</P>
<P  >“Then
he is wise; he possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that
is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of
suffering. These are the five factors of striving.</P>
<P  >59.
“Prince, when a bhikkhu who possesses these five factors of
striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him, he might dwell seven
years until by realising for himself with direct knowledge, he here
and now enters upon and abides in that supreme goal of the holy life
for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life
into homelessness. [96]</P>
<P  >“Let
alone seven years, prince. When a bhikkhu who possesses these five
factors of striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him, he might
dwell six years … five years … four years … three years … two
years … one year … Let alone one year, prince, … he might dwell
seven months … six months … five months … four months … three
months … two months … one month … half a month … Let alone
half a month, prince, … he might dwell seven days and nights …
six days and nights … five days and nights … four days and nights
… three days and nights … two days and nights … one day and
night.</P>
<P  >“Let
alone one day and night, prince. When a bhikkhu who possesses these
five factors of striving finds a Tathagata to discipline him, then
being instructed in the evening, he might arrive at distinction in
the morning; being instructed in the morning, he might arrive at
distinction in the evening.”</P>
<P  >60.
When this was said, Prince Bodhi said to the Blessed One: “Oh the
Buddha! Oh the Dhamma! Oh, how well proclaimed is the Dhamma! For one
instructed in the evening might arrive at distinction in the morning,
and one instructed in the morning might arrive at distinction in the
evening.”</P>
<P  >61.
When this was said, the brahmin student Sanjikaputta said to Prince
Bodhi: “Master Bodhi says: ‘Oh the Buddha! Oh the Dhamma! Oh, how
well proclaimed is the Dhamma!’ But he does not say: ‘I go to
Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus.’“</P>
<P  >“Do
not say that, my dear Sanjikaputta, do not say that. I heard and
learned this from my mother’s lips: [97] There was an occasion when
the Blessed One was living at Kosambi in Ghosita’s Park. Then my
mother, who was pregnant, went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, she sat down at one side and said to him: ‘Venerable
sir, the prince or princess in my womb, whichever it may be, goes to
the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One remember [the child] as a lay follower
who has gone to him for refuge for life.’ There was also an
occasion when the Blessed One was living here in the country of the
Bhaggas at Sumsumaragira in the Bhesakala Grove, the Deer Park. Then
my nurse, carrying me on her hip, went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, she stood at one side and said to him:
‘Venerable sir, this Prince Bodhi goes to the Blessed One for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let the
Blessed One remember him as a lay follower who has gone to him for
refuge for life.’ Now, my dear Sanjikaputta, for the third time I
go to the Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha
of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who
has gone to him for refuge for life.”</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading87"  >
86. Angulimala Sutta - On Angulimala</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion there was a bandit in the realm of King Pasenadi
of Kosala named Angulimala, who was murderous, bloody-handed, given
to blows and violence, merciless to living beings. Villages, towns,
[98] and districts were laid waste by him. He was constantly
murdering people and he wore their fingers as a garland.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote820anc" HREF="#sdendnote820sym"><SUP>dcccxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from his almsround,
after his meal he set his resting place in order, and taking his bowl
and outer robe, set out on the road leading towards Angulimala.
Cowherds, shepherds, and ploughmen passing by saw the Blessed One
walking along the road leading towards Angulimala and told him: “Do
not take this road, recluse. On this road is the bandit Angulimala,
who is murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence,
merciless to living beings. Villages, towns, and districts have been
laid waste by him. He is constantly murdering people and he wears
their fingers as a garland. Men have come along this road in groups
of ten, twenty, thirty, and even forty, but still they have fallen
into Angulimala’s hands.” When this was said the Blessed One went
on in silence.</P>
<P  >For
the second time … For the third time the cowherds, shepherds, and
ploughmen told this to the Blessed One, but still the Blessed One
went on in silence.</P>
<P  >4.
The bandit Angulimala saw the Blessed One coming in the distance.
When he saw him, he thought: “It is wonderful, it is marvellous!
Men have come along this road in groups of ten, twenty, [99] thirty,
and even forty, but still they have fallen into my hands. And now
this recluse comes alone, unaccompanied, as if driven by fate. Why
shouldn’t I take this recluse’s life?” Angulimala then took up
his sword and shield, buckled on his bow and quiver, and followed
close behind the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >5.
Then the Blessed One performed such a feat of supernormal power that
the bandit Angulimala, though walking as fast as he could, could not
catch up with the Blessed One, who was walking at his normal pace.
Then the bandit Angulimala thought: “It is wonderful, it is
marvellous! Formerly I could catch up even with a swift elephant and
seize it; I could catch up even with a swift horse and seize it; I
could catch up even with a swift chariot and seize it; I could catch
up even with a swift deer and seize it; but now, though I am walking
as fast as I can, I cannot catch up with this recluse who is walking
at his normal pace!” He stopped and called out to the Blessed One:
“Stop, recluse! Stop, recluse!”</P>
<P  >“I
have stopped, Angulimala, you stop too.”</P>
<P  >Then
the bandit Angulimala thought: “These recluses, sons of the
Sakyans, speak truth, assert truth; but though this recluse is still
walking, he says: ‘I have stopped, Angulimala, you stop too.’
Suppose I question this recluse.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then the bandit Angulimala addressed the Blessed One in stanzas thus:</P>
<P >
“While you are walking, recluse, you tell me you have stopped;</P>
<P >
But now, when I have stopped, you say I have not stopped.</P>
<P >
I ask you now, O recluse, about the meaning:</P>
<P >
How is it that you have stopped and I have not?”</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
“Angulimala, I have stopped forever,</P>
<P >
I abstain from violence towards living beings;</P>
<P >
But you have no restraint towards things that live:</P>
<P >
That is why I have stopped and you have not.” [100]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
“Oh, at long last this recluse, a venerated sage,</P>
<P >
Has come to this great forest for my sake.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote821anc" HREF="#sdendnote821sym"><SUP>dcccxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
Having heard your stanza teaching me the Dhamma,</P>
<P >
I will indeed renounce evil forever.”</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
So saying, the bandit took his sword and weapons</P>
<P >
And flung them in a gaping chasm’s pit;</P>
<P >
The bandit worshipped the Sublime One’s feet,</P>
<P >
And then and there asked for the going forth.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
The Enlightened One, the Sage of Great Compassion,</P>
<P >
The Teacher of the world with [all] its gods,</P>
<P >
Addressed him with these words, “Come, bhikkhu.”</P>
<P >
And that was how he came to be a bhikkhu.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote822anc" HREF="#sdendnote822sym"><SUP>dcccxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One set out to wander back to Savatthi with
Angulimala as his attendant. Wandering by stages, he eventually
arrived at Savatthi, and there he lived at Savatthi in Jeta’s
Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >8.
Now on that occasion great crowds of people were gathering at the
gates of King Pasenadi s inner palace, very loud and noisy, crying:
“Sire, the bandit Angulimala is in your realm; he is murderous,
bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to living
beings! Villages, towns, and districts have been laid waste by him!
He is constantly murdering people and he wears their fingers as a
garland! The king must put him down!”</P>
<P  >9.
Then in the middle of the day King Pasenadi of Kosala drove out of
Savatthi with a cavalry of five hundred men and set out for the park.
He drove thus as far as the road was passable for carriages, and then
he dismounted from his carriage and went forward on foot to the
Blessed One. [101] After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat
down at one side, and the Blessed One said to him: “What is it,
great king? Is King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha attacking you, or the
Licchavis of Vesali, or other hostile kings?”</P>
<P  >10.
“Venerable sir, King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha is not attacking
me, nor are the Licchavis of Vesali, nor are other hostile kings. But
there is a bandit in my realm named Angulimala, who is murderous,
bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to living
beings. Villages, towns, and districts have been laid waste by him.
He is constantly murdering people and he wears their fingers as a
garland. I shall never be able to put him down, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >11.
“Great king, suppose you were to see that Angulimala had shaved off
his hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and gone forth from the
home life into homelessness; that he was abstaining from killing
living beings, from taking what is not given and from false speech;
that he was refraining from eating at night, ate only in one part of
the day, and was celibate, virtuous, of good character. If you were
to see him thus, how would you treat him?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, we would pay homage to him, or rise up for him, or invite him to
be seated; or we would invite him to accept robes, almsfood, a
resting place, or medicinal requisites; or we would arrange for him
lawful guarding, defence, and protection.</P>
<P  >But,
venerable sir, he is an immoral man, one of evil character. How could
he ever have such virtue and restraint?”</P>
<P  >12.
Now on that occasion the venerable Angulimala was sitting not far
from the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One extended his right arm and
said to King Pasenadi of Kosala: “Great king, this is Angulimala.”</P>
<P  >Then
King Pasenadi was frightened, alarmed, and terrified. Knowing this,
the Blessed One told him: “Do not be afraid, great king, do not be
afraid. There is nothing for you to fear from him.”</P>
<P  >Then
the king’s fear, [102] alarm, and terror subsided. He went over to
the venerable Angulimala and said: “Venerable sir, is the noble
lord really Angulimala?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
great king.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, of what family is the noble lord’s father? Of what family is
his mother?”</P>
<P  >“My
father is a Gagga, great king; my mother is a Mantani.”</P>
<P  >“Let
the noble lord Gagga Mantaniputta rest content. I shall provide
robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites for the
noble lord Gagga Mantaniputta.”</P>
<P  >13.
Now at that time the venerable Angulimala was a forest dweller, an
almsfood eater, a refuse-rag wearer, and restricted himself to three
robes. He replied: “Enough, great king, my triple robe is
complete.”</P>
<P  >King
Pasenadi then returned to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to
him, he sat down at one side and said: “It is wonderful, venerable
sir, it is marvellous how the Blessed One tames the untamed, brings
peace to the unpeaceful, and leads to Nibbana those who have not
attained Nibbana. Venerable sir, we ourselves could not tame him with
force and weapons, yet the</P>
<P  >Blessed
One has tamed him without force or weapons. And now, venerable sir,
we depart. We are busy and have much to do.”</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time, great king, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >Then
King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat, and after paying homage
to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.</P>
<P  >14.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Angulimala dressed, and
taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. As he
was wandering for alms from house to house in Savatthi, he saw a
certain woman giving birth to a deformed child. [103] When he saw
this, he thought: “How beings are afflicted! Indeed, how beings are
afflicted!”</P>
<P  >When
he had wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from his
almsround, after his meal he went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said: “Venerable
sir, in the morning I dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe,
went into Savatthi for alms. As I was wandering for alms from house
to house in Savatthi, I saw a certain woman giving birth to a
deformed child. When I saw that, I thought: ‘How beings are
afflicted! Indeed, how beings are afflicted!’“</P>
<P  >15.
“In that case, Angulimala, go into Savatthi and say to that woman:
‘Sister, since I was born, I do not recall that I have ever
intentionally deprived a living being of life. By this truth, may you
be well and may your infant be well!’“</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, wouldn’t I be telling a deliberate lie, for I have
intentionally deprived many living beings of life?”</P>
<P  >“Then,
Angulimala, go into Savatthi and say to that woman: ‘Sister, since
I was born with the noble birth, I do not recall that I have ever
intentionally deprived a living being of life. By this truth, may you
be well and may your infant be well! ’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote823anc" HREF="#sdendnote823sym"><SUP>dcccxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” the venerable Angulimala replied, and having gone
into Savatthi, he told that woman: “Sister, since I was born with
the noble birth, I do not recall that I have ever intentionally
deprived a living being of life. By this truth, may you be well and
may your infant be well!” Then the woman and the infant became
well.</P>
<P  >16.
Before long, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and
resolute, the venerable Angulimala, by realising for himself with
direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that
supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly
go forth from the home life into homelessness. He directly knew:
“Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be
done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.”
[104] And the venerable Angulimala became one of the arahants.</P>
<P  >17.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Angulimala dressed, and
taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. Now on
that occasion someone threw a clod and hit the venerable Angulimala’s
body, someone else threw a stick and hit his body, and someone else
threw a potsherd and hit his body. Then, with blood running from his
cut head, with his bowl broken, and with his outer robe torn, the
venerable Angulimala went to the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw him
coming in the distance and told him: “Bear it, brahmin! Bear it,
brahmin! You are experiencing here and now the result of deeds
because of which you might have been tortured in hell for many years,
for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote824anc" HREF="#sdendnote824sym"><SUP>dcccxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >18.
Then, while the venerable Angulimala was alone in retreat
experiencing the bliss of deliverance, he uttered this exclamation:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote825anc" HREF="#sdendnote825sym"><SUP>dcccxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

87. Piyajatika Sutta - Born from Those Who Are Dear</H2>
<P  >[106]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapinclika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a certain householder’s dear and beloved only
son had died. After his son’s death, he had no more desire to work
or to eat. He kept going to the charnel ground and crying: “My only
child, where are you? My only child, where are you?”</P>
<P  >3.
Then that householder went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One said to him:
“Householder, your faculties are not those of one in control of his
own mind. Your faculties are deranged.”</P>
<P  >“How
could my faculties not be deranged, venerable sir? For my dear and
beloved only son has died. Since he died I have no more desire to
work or to eat. I keep going to the charnel ground and crying: ‘My
only child, where are you? My only child, where are you?’“</P>
<P  >“So
it is, householder, so it is! Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are
dear.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, who would ever think that sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are
dear? Venerable sir, happiness and joy are born from those who are
dear, arise from those who are dear.” Then, displeased with the
Blessed One’s words, disapproving of them, the householder rose
from his seat and left.</P>
<P  >4.
Now on that occasion some gamblers were playing with dice not far
from the Blessed One. Then the householder went to those gamblers and
said: “Just now, sirs, [107] I went to the recluse Gotama, and
after paying homage to him, I sat down at one side. When I had done
so, the recluse Gotama said to me:</P>
<P  >‘Householder,
your faculties are not those of one in control of his own mind.’ …
(repeat the entire conversation as above) … ‘Vener</P>
<P  >able
sir, happiness and joy are born from those who are dear, arise from
those who are dear.’ Then, displeased with the recluse Gotama’s
words, disapproving of them, I rose from my seat and left.”</P>
<P  >“So
it is, householder, so it is! Happiness and joy are born from those
who are dear, arise from those who are dear.”</P>
<P  >Then
the householder left thinking: “I agree with the gamblers.”</P>
<P  >5.
Eventually this story reached the king’s palace. Then King Pasenadi
of Kosala told Queen Mallika: “This is what has been said by the
recluse Gotama, Mallika: ‘Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are
dear.’“</P>
<P  >“If
that has been said by the Blessed One, sire, then it is so.”</P>
<P  >“No
matter what the recluse Gotama says, Mallika applauds it thus: ‘If
that has been said by the Blessed One, sire, then it is so.’ Just
as a pupil applauds whatever his teacher says to him, saying: ‘So
it is, teacher, so it is!’; so too, Mallika, no matter what the
recluse Gotama says, you applaud it thus: ‘If that [108] has been
said by the Blessed One, sire, then it is so.’ Be off, Mallika,
away with you!”</P>
<P  >6.
Then Queen Mallika addressed the brahmin Nalijangha: “Come,
brahmin, go to the Blessed One and pay homage in my name with your
head at his feet, and ask whether he is free from illness and
affliction and is healthy, strong, and abiding in comfort, saying:
‘Venerable sir, Queen Mallika pays homage with her head at the
Blessed One’s feet and asks whether the Blessed One is free from
illness … and abiding in comfort.’ Then say this: ‘Venerable
sir, have these words been uttered by the Blessed One: “Sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are
dear, arise from those who are dear”?’ Learn well what the
Blessed One replies and report it to me; for Tathagatas do not speak
untruth.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
madam,” he replied, and he went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said: “Master Gotama, Queen
Mallika pays homage with her head at Master Gotama’s feet and asks
whether he is free from illness … and abiding in comfort. And she
says this: ‘Venerable</P>
<P  >sir,
have these words been spoken by the Blessed One: “Sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are
dear, arise from those who are dear”?’“</P>
<P  >7.
“So it is, brahmin, so it is! Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are
dear.</P>
<P  >8.
“It can be understood from this, brahmin, how sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are dear, arise from
those who are dear. Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain
woman whose mother died. Owing to her mother’s death, she went mad,
lost her mind, and wandered from street to street and from crossroad
to crossroad, saying: ‘Have you seen my mother? Have you seen my
mother?’ [109]</P>
<P  >9-14.
“And it can also be understood from this how sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are dear, arise from
those who are dear. Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain
woman whose father died … whose brother died … whose sister died
… whose son died … whose daughter died … whose husband died.
Owing to her husband’s death, she went mad, lost her mind, and
wandered from street to street and from crossroad to crossroad,
saying: ‘Have you seen my husband? Have you seen my husband?’</P>
<P  >15-21.
“And it can also be understood from this how sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are dear, arise from
those who are dear. Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain
man whose mother died … whose father died … whose brother died …
whose sister died … whose son died … whose daughter died …
whose wife died. Owing to his wife’s death, he went mad, lost his
mind, and wandered from street to street and from crossroad to
crossroad, saying: ‘Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my wife?’</P>
<P  >22.
“And it can also be understood from this how sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are dear, arise from
those who are dear. Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain
woman who went to live with her relatives’ family. Her relatives
wanted to divorce her from her husband and give her to another whom
she did not want. Then the woman said to her husband: ‘Lord, these
relatives of mine want to divorce me from you and give me to another
whom I</P>
<P  >do
not want.’ Then the man cut the woman in two and [110] committed
suicide, thinking: ‘We shall be together in the afterlife.’ It
can also be understood from this how sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair are born from those who are dear, arise from those
who are dear.”</P>
<P  >23.
Then, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One’s words, the
brahmin Nalijangha rose from his seat, went to Queen Mallika, and
reported to her his entire conversation with the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >24.
Then Queen Mallika went to King Pasenadi of Kosala and asked him:
“What do you think, sire? Is Princess Vajiri dear to you?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
Mallika, Princess Vajiri is dear to me.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, sire? If.change and alteration<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote828anc" HREF="#sdendnote828sym"><SUP>dcccxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
took place in Princess Vajiri, would sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair arise in you?”</P>
<P  >“Change
and alteration in Princess Vajiri would mean an alteration in my
life. How could sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair not
arise in me?”</P>
<P  >“It
was with reference to this, sire, that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: ‘Sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are
dear, arise from those who are dear.’</P>
<P  >25-28.
“What do you think, sire? Is the noble Queen Vasabha dear to you? …
Is General Vidudabha dear to you? … [111] … Am I dear to you? …
Are Kasi and Kosala dear to you?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote829anc" HREF="#sdendnote829sym"><SUP>dcccxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Yes,
Mallika, Kasi and Kosala are dear to me. We owe it to Kasi and Kosala
that we use Kasi sandalwood and wear garlands, scents, and unguents.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, sire? If change and alteration took place in Kasi and
Kosala, would sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise in
you?”</P>
<P  >“Change
and alteration in Kasi and Kosala would mean an alteration in my
life. How could sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair not
arise in me?”</P>
<P  >“It
was with reference to this, sire, that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: ‘Sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are
dear, arise from those who are dear.’“</P>
<P  >29.
“It is wonderful, Mallika, it is marvellous how far [112] the
Blessed One penetrates with wisdom and sees with wisdom! Come,
Mallika, give me the ablution water.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote830anc" HREF="#sdendnote830sym"><SUP>dcccxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Then
King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat, and arranging his upper
robe on one shoulder, he extended his hands in reverential salutation
towards the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation three times:
“Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened!
Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened! Honour
to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened!”</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading89"  >
88. Bahitika Sutta - The Cloak</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Ananda dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from his almsround,
after his meal he went to the Eastern Park, to the Palace of Migara’s
Mother, for the day’s abiding.</P>
<P  >3.
Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had mounted the elephant
Ekapundarika and was riding out from Savatthi at midday. He saw the
venerable Ananda coming in the distance and asked the minister
Sirivaddha: “That is the venerable Ananda, is it not?” - “Yes,
sire, that is the venerable Ananda.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala told a man: “Come, good man, go to the
venerable Ananda and pay homage in my name with your head at his
feet, saying: ‘Venerable sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage
with his head at the venerable Ananda’s feet.’ Then say this:
‘Venerable sir, if the venerable Ananda has no urgent business,
perhaps the venerable Ananda would wait [113] a moment, out of
compassion.’“</P>
<P  >5.
“Yes, sire,” the man replied, and he went to the venerable
Ananda, and after paying homage to him, he stood at one side and said
to the venerable Ananda: “Venerable sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala
pays homage with his head at the venerable Ananda’s feet and he
says this: ‘Venerable sir, if the venerable Ananda has no urgent
business, perhaps the venerable Ananda would wait a moment, out of
compassion.’“</P>
<P  >6.
The venerable Ananda consented in silence. Then King Pasenadi went by
elephant as far as the elephant could go, and then he dismounted and
went to the venerable Ananda on foot. After paying homage to him, he
stood at one side and said to the venerable Ananda: “If, venerable
sir, the venerable Ananda has no urgent business, it would be good if
he would go to the bank of the river Aciravati, out of compassion.”</P>
<P  >7.
The venerable Ananda consented in silence. He went to the bank of the
river Aciravati and sat down at the root of a tree on a seat made
ready. Then King Pasenadi went by elephant as far as the elephant
could go, and then he dismounted and went to the venerable Ananda on
foot. After paying homage to him, he stood at one side and said to
the venerable Ananda: “Here, venerable sir, is an elephant rug. Let
the venerable Ananda be seated on it.”</P>
<P  >“There
is no need, great king. Sit down. I am sitting on my own mat.”</P>
<P  >8.
King Pasenadi of Kosala sat down on a seat made ready and said:
“Venerable Ananda, would the Blessed One behave with the body in
such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahmins?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote831anc" HREF="#sdendnote831sym"><SUP>dcccxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“No,
great king, the Blessed One would not behave with the body in such a
way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahmins.” [114]</P>
<P  >“Would
the Blessed One, venerable Ananda, behave with speech … behave with
the mind in such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and
brahmins?”</P>
<P  >“No,
great king, the Blessed One would not behave with speech … behave
with the mind in such a way that he could be censured by wise
recluses and brahmins.”</P>
<P  >9.
“It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! For what we were
unable to accomplish with a question has been accomplished by the
venerable Ananda with the answer to the question. We do not recognise
anything of value in the praise and blame of others spoken by foolish
ignorant persons, who speak without having investigated and
evaluated; but we recognise as valuable the praise and blame of
others spoken by wise, intelligent, and sagacious persons who speak
after having investigated and evaluated.</P>
<P  >10.
“Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is censured
by wise recluses and brahmins?”</P>
<P  >“Any
bodily behaviour that is unwholesome, great king.”</P>
<P  >“Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is unwholesome?”</P>
<P  >“Any
bodily behaviour that is blameworthy, great king.”</P>
<P  >“Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is blameworthy?”</P>
<P  >“Any
bodily behaviour that brings affliction, great king.” “Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour brings affliction?”</P>
<P  >“Any
bodily behaviour that has painful results, great king.” “Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour has painful results?”</P>
<P  >“Any
bodily behaviour, great king, that leads to one’s own affliction,
or to the affliction of others, or to the affliction of both, and on
account of which unwholesome states increase and wholesome states
diminish. Such bodily behaviour is censured by wise recluses and
brahmins, great king.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote832anc" HREF="#sdendnote832sym"><SUP>dcccxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
“Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of verbal behaviour is censured
by wise recluses and brahmins?”</P>
<P  >“Any
verbal behaviour that is unwholesome … (complete as in §10,
substituting “verbal behaviour” for “bodily behaviour”) … ”
12. “Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of mental behaviour is
censured by wise recluses and brahmins?”</P>
<P  >“Any
mental behaviour that is unwholesome … (complete as in §10,
substituting “mental behaviour” for “bodily behaviour”) [115]
… ”</P>
<P  >13.
“Now, venerable Ananda, does the Blessed One praise only the
abandoning of all unwholesome states?” “The Tathagata, great
king, has abandoned all unwholesome states and he possesses wholesome
states.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote833anc" HREF="#sdendnote833sym"><SUP>dcccxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
“Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is uncensured

<P  >“Any
bodily behaviour that is wholesome, great king.”</P>
<P  >“Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is wholesome?”</P>
<P  >“Any
bodily behaviour that is blameless, great king.”</P>
<P  >“Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is blameless?”</P>
<P  >“Any
bodily behaviour that does not bring affliction, great king.” “Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour does not bring
affliction?”</P>
<P  >“Any

venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour has pleasant
results?”</P>
<P  >“Any
bodily behaviour, great king, that does not lead to one’s own
affliction, or to the affliction of others, or to the affliction of
both, and on account of which unwholesome states diminish and
wholesome states increase. Such bodily behaviour, great king, is
uncensured by wise recluses and brahmins.”</P>
<P  >15.
“Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of verbal behaviour is uncensured
by wise recluses and brahmins?”</P>
<P  >“Any
verbal behaviour that is wholesome … (complete as in §14,
substituting “verbal behaviour” for “bodily behaviour”) … ”</P>
<P  >16.
“Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of mental behaviour is uncensured
by wise recluses and brahmins?”</P>
<P  >“Any
mental behaviour that is wholesome … (complete as in §14,
substituting “mental behaviour” for “bodily behaviour”) [116]
… ”</P>
<P  >17.
“Now, venerable Ananda, does the Blessed One praise only the
undertaking of all wholesome states?”</P>
<P  >“The
Tathagata, great king, has abandoned all unwholesome states and
possesses wholesome states.”</P>
<P  >18.
“It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous how well that has
been expressed by the venerable Ananda! And we are satisfied and
pleased by what has been so well expressed by him. Venerable sir, we
are so satisfied and pleased with what has been so well expressed by
the venerable Ananda that if the elephant-treasure were allowed to
him, we would give it to him; if the horse-treasure were allowed to
him, we would give it to him; if the boon of a village were allowed
to him, we would give it to him. But we know, venerable sir, that
these are not allowable for the venerable Ananda. But there is this
cloak of mine,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote834anc" HREF="#sdendnote834sym"><SUP>dcccxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
venerable sir, which was sent to me packed in a royal umbrella case
by King Ajatasattu of Magadha, sixteen hands long and eight hands
wide. Let the venerable Ananda accept it out of compassion.”</P>
<P  >“It
is not necessary, great king. My triple robe is complete.” [117]</P>
<P  >19.
“Venerable sir, this river Aciravati has been seen both by the
venerable Ananda and by ourselves when a great cloud has rained
heavily on the mountains; then this river Aciravati overflows both
its banks. So too, venerable sir, the venerable Ananda can make a
triple robe for himself out of this cloak, and he can share out his
old triple robe among his companions in the holy life. In this way,
our offering will overflow. Venerable sir, let the venerable Ananda
accept the cloak.”</P>
<P  >20.
The venerable Ananda accepted the cloak. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala
said: “And now, venerable sir, we depart. We are busy and have much
to do.”</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time, great king, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >Then
King Pasenadi of Kosala, having delighted and rejoiced in the
venerable Ananda’s words, rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to the venerable Ananda, keeping him on his right, he
departed.</P>
<P  >21.
Then soon after he had left, the venerable Ananda went to the Blessed
One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side, related
to him his entire conversation with King Pasenadi of Kosala, and
presented the cloak to the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >22.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “It is a gain,
bhikkhus, for King Pasenadi of Kosala, it is a great gain for King
Pasenadi of Kosala that he has had the opportunity of seeing and
paying respect to Ananda.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

89. Dhammacetiya Sutta - Monuments to the Dhamma</H2>
<P  >[118]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named Medalumpa.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Nagaraka
for some business or other. Then he addressed Digha Karayana:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote835anc" HREF="#sdendnote835sym"><SUP>dcccxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
“Dear Karayana, have the state carriages prepared. Let us go to the
pleasure garden to see a pleasing spot.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sire,” Digha Karayana replied. When the state carriages were
prepared, he informed the king: “Sire, the state carriages are
ready for you. Now is the time to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then King Pasenadi mounted a state carriage, and accompanied by the
other carriages, he drove out from Nagaraka with the full pomp of
royalty and proceeded towards the park. He went thus as far as the
road was passable for carriages and then dismounted from his carriage
and entered the park on foot.</P>
<P  >4.
As he walked and wandered in the park for exercise, King Pasenadi saw
roots of trees that were lovely and inspiring, quiet and undisturbed
by voices, with an atmosphere of seclusion, remote from people,
favourable for retreat. The sight of these reminded him of the
Blessed One thus: “These roots of trees are lovely and inspiring,
quiet and undisturbed by voices, with an atmosphere of seclusion,
remote from people, favourable for retreat, like the places where we
used to pay respect to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened.” Then he told Digha Karayana what he had thought and
asked: “Where is he living now, [119] the Blessed One, accomplished
and fully enlightened?”</P>
<P  >5.
“There is, sire, a town of the Sakyans named Medalumpa. The Blessed
One, accomplished and fully enlightened, is now living there.”</P>
<P  >“How
far is it from Nagaraka to Medalumpa?”</P>
<P  >“It
is not far, sire, three leagues.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote836anc" HREF="#sdendnote836sym"><SUP>dcccxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
There is still daylight enough to go there.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
dear Karayana, have the state carriages prepared. Let us go and see
the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sire,” he replied. When the state carriages were prepared, he
informed the king: “Sire, the state carriages are ready for you.
Now is the time to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then King Pasenadi mounted a state carriage, and accompanied by the
other carriages, set out from Nagaraka towards the Sakyan town of
Medalumpa. He arrived there while it was still daylight and proceeded
towards the park. He went thus as far as the road was passable for
carriages, and then he dismounted from his carriage and entered the
park on foot.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were walking up and down in
the open. Then King Pasenadi went to them and asked: “Venerable
sirs, where is he living now, the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened? We want to see the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened.”</P>
<P  >8.
“That is his dwelling, great king, with the closed door. Go up to
it quietly, without hurrying, enter the porch, clear your throat, and
tap on the panel. The Blessed One will open the door for you.” King
Pasenadi handed over his sword and turban to Digha Karayana then and
there. Then Digha Karayana thought: “So the king is going into
secret session now! And I have to wait here alone now!”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote837anc" HREF="#sdendnote837sym"><SUP>dcccxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Without hurrying, King Pasenadi went quietly up to the dwelling with
the closed door, entered the porch, cleared his throat, and tapped on
the panel. The Blessed One opened the door.</P>
<P  >9.
Then King Pasenadi [120] entered the dwelling. Prostrating himself
with his head at the Blessed One’s feet, he covered the Blessed
One’s feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands,
pronouncing his name: “I am King Pasenadi of Kosala, venerable sir;
I am King Pasenadi of Kosala, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“But,
great king, what reason do you see for doing such supreme honour to
this body and for showing such friendship?”</P>
<P  >10.
“Venerable sir, I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One:
‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well
proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha of the Blessed One’s
disciples is practising the good way.’ Now, venerable sir, I see
some recluses and brahmins leading a limited holy life for ten years,
twenty years, thirty years, or forty years, and then on a later
occasion I see them well groomed and well anointed, with trimmed hair
and beards, enjoying themselves provided and endowed with the five
cords of sensual pleasure. But here I see bhikkhus leading the
perfect and pure holy life as long as life and breath last. Indeed, I
do not see any other holy life elsewhere as perfect and pure as this.
This is why, venerable sir, I infer according to Dhamma about the
Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is
well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha of the Blessed One’s
disciples is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >11.
“Again, venerable sir, kings quarrel with kings, nobles with
nobles, brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders;
mother quarrels with child, child with mother, father with child,
child with father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with
sister, sister with brother, friend with friend.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote838anc" HREF="#sdendnote838sym"><SUP>dcccxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
But here I see bhikkhus living in concord, with mutual appreciation,
without disputing, blending like milk and water, [121] viewing each
other with kindly eyes. I do not see any other assembly elsewhere
with such concord. This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according
to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >12.
“Again, venerable sir, I have walked and wandered from park to park
and from garden to garden. There I have seen some recluses and
brahmins who are lean, wretched, unsightly, jaundiced, with veins
standing out on their limbs, such that people would not want to look
at them again. I have thought: ‘Surely these venerable ones are
leading the holy life in discontent, or they have done some evil deed
and are concealing it, so lean and wretched are they-such that people
would not want to look at them again.’ I went up to them and asked:
‘Why are you venerable ones so lean and wretched … such that
people would not want to look at you again?’ Their reply was: ‘It
is our family sickness, great king.’ But here I see bhikkhus
smiling and cheerful, sincerely joyful, plainly delighting, their
faculties fresh, living at ease, unruffled, subsisting on what others
give, abiding with mind [as aloof] as a wild deer’s. I have
thought: ‘Surely these venerable ones perceive successive states of
lofty distinction in the Blessed One’s Dispensation, since they
abide thus smiling and cheerful … with mind [as aloof] as a wild
deer’s.’ This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according to
Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >13.
“Again, venerable sir, being a head-anointed noble king, [122] I am
able to have executed those who should be executed, to fine those who
should be fined, to exile those who should be exiled. Yet when I am
sitting in council, they break in and interrupt me. Though I say:
‘Gentlemen, do not break in and interrupt me when I am sitting in
council; wait till the end of my speech,’ still they break in and
interrupt me. But here I see bhikkhus while the Blessed One is
teaching the Dhamma<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote839anc" HREF="#sdendnote839sym"><SUP>dcccxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
to an assembly of several hundred followers and then there is not
even the sound of a disciple of the Blessed One coughing or clearing
his throat. Once the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma to an
assembly of several hundred followers and there a disciple of his
cleared his throat. Thereupon one of his companions in the holy life
nudged him with his knee to indicate: ‘Be quiet, venerable sir,
make no noise; the Blessed One, the Teacher, is teaching us the
Dhamma.’ I thought: ‘It is wonderful, it is marvellous how an
assembly can be so well disciplined without force or weapon!’
Indeed, I do not see any other assembly elsewhere so well
disciplined. This too, venerable sir, is why I infer according to
Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >14.
“Again, venerable sir, I have seen here certain learned nobles who
were clever, knowledgeable about the doctrines of others, as sharp as
hairsplitting marksmen;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote840anc" HREF="#sdendnote840sym"><SUP>dcccxl</SUP></A></SUP>
they wander about, as it were, demolishing the views of others with
their sharp wits. When they hear: ‘The recluse Gotama will visit
such and such a village or town,’ they formulate a question thus:
‘We will go to the recluse Gotama and ask him this question. If he
is asked like this, he will answer like this, and so we will refute
his doctrine in this way; and if he is asked like that, he will
answer like that, and so we will refute his doctrine in that way.’
They hear: ‘The recluse Gotama has come to visit such and such a
village or town.’ They go to the Blessed One, and the Blessed One
instructs, urges, rouses, [123] and encourages them with a talk on
the Dhamma. After they have been instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma, they do not
so much as ask him the question, so how should they refute his
doctrine? In actual fact, they become his disciples. This too,
venerable sir, is why I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed
One: ‘The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well
proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha of the Blessed One’s
disciples is practising the good way.’</P>
<P  >15.
“Again, venerable sir, I have seen here certain learned brahmins …</P>
<P  >16.
“Again, venerable sir, I have seen here certain learned
householders …</P>
<P  >17.
“Again, venerable sir, I have seen here certain learned recluses …
They do not so much as ask him the question, so how should they
refute his doctrine? In actual fact, they ask the Blessed One to
allow them to go forth from the home life into homelessness, and he
gives them the going forth. Not long after they have thus gone forth,
dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, by
realising for themselves with direct knowledge they here and now
enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the
sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into
homelessness. They say thus: ‘We were very nearly lost, we very
nearly perished, for formerly we claimed that we were recluses though
we were not really recluses; we claimed that we were brahmins though
we were not really brahmins; we claimed that we were arahants though
we were not really arahants. But now we are recluses, now we are
brahmins, now we are arahants.’ This too, venerable sir, is why I
infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One
is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed
One, the Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the
good way.’</P>
<P  >18.
“Again, venerable sir, Isidatta and Purana,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote841anc" HREF="#sdendnote841sym"><SUP>dcccxli</SUP></A></SUP>
my two inspectors, eat my food and use my carriages; I provide them
with a livelihood and bring them fame. Yet in spite of this, they are
less respectful towards me [124] than they are towards the Blessed
One. Once when I had gone out leading an army and was testing these
inspectors, Isidatta and Purana, I happened to put up in very cramped
quarters. Then these two inspectors, Isidatta and Purana, after
spending much of the night in talk on the Dhamma, lay down with their
heads in the direction where they had heard that the Blessed One was
staying and with their feet towards me. I thought: ‘It is
wonderful, it is marvellous! These two inspectors, Isidatta and
Purana, eat my food and use my carriages; I provide them with a
livelihood and bring them fame. Yet in spite of this, they are less
respectful towards me than they are towards the Blessed One. Surely
these good people perceive successive states of lofty distinction in
the Blessed One’s Dispensation.’ This too, venerable sir, is why
I infer according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One
is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed
One, the Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the
good way.’</P>
<P  >19.
“Again, venerable sir, the Blessed One is a noble and I am a noble;
the Blessed One is a Kosalan and I am a Kosalan; the Blessed One is
eighty years old and I am eighty years old.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote842anc" HREF="#sdendnote842sym"><SUP>dcccxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
Since that is so, I think it proper to do such supreme honour to the
Blessed One and to show such friendship.</P>
<P  >20.
“And now, venerable sir, we depart. We are busy and have much to
do.”</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time, great king, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >Then
King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat, and after paying homage
to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote843anc" HREF="#sdendnote843sym"><SUP>dcccxliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >21.
Then soon after he had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus: “Bhikkhus, before rising from his seat and departing, this
King Pasenadi uttered monuments to the Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote844anc" HREF="#sdendnote844sym"><SUP>dcccxliv</SUP></A></SUP>
Learn the monuments to the Dhamma, bhikkhus; master [125] the
monuments to the Dhamma; remember the monuments to the Dhamma. The
monuments to the Dhamma are beneficial, bhikkhus, and they belong to
the fundamentals of the holy life.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading91"  >
90. Kannakatthala Sutta - At Kannakatthala</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Ujunna, in the Kannakatthala Deer Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had arrived at Ujunna
for some business or other. Then he told a man: “Come, good man, go
to the Blessed One and pay homage in my name with your head at his
feet, and ask whether he is free from illness and affliction, and is
healthy, strong, and abiding in comfort, saying: ‘Venerable sir,
King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage with his head at the Blessed
One’s feet, and he asks whether the Blessed One is free from
illness … and abiding in comfort.’ And say this: ‘Venerable
sir, today King Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see the Blessed One
after he has had his breakfast.’“</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sire,” the man replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and delivered his
message.</P>
<P  >3.
The sisters Soma and Sakula<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote845anc" HREF="#sdendnote845sym"><SUP>dcccxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
heard: “Today [126] King Pasenadi of Kosala will go to see the
Blessed One after he has had his breakfast.”</P>
<P  >Then,
while the meal was being served, the two sisters went to the king and
said: “Sire, pay homage in our name with your head at the Blessed
One’s feet, and ask whether he is free from illness … and abiding
in comfort, saying: ‘Venerable sir, the sisters Soma and Sakula pay
homage with their heads at the Blessed One’s feet, and they ask
whether he is free from illness.. .and abiding in comfort.’“</P>
<P  >4.
Then, when he had finished his breakfast, King Pasenadi of Kosala
went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down
at one side and delivered the message of the sisters Soma and Sakula.</P>
<P  >“But,
great king, could the sisters Soma and Sakula find no other
messenger?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, the sisters Soma and Sakula heard: ‘Today King Pasenadi of
Kosala will go to see the Blessed One after he has had his
breakfast.’ Then, while the meal was being served, the sisters Soma
and Sakula came to me and said: ‘Sire, pay homage in our names with
your head at the Blessed One’s feet, and ask whether he is free
from illness … and abiding in comfort.’“</P>
<P  >“May
the sisters Soma and Sakula be happy, great king.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Venerable
sir, I have heard this: ‘The recluse Gotama says: “There is no
recluse or brahmin who is omniscient and all-seeing, who can claim to
have complete knowledge and vision; that is not possible.’“Venerable
sir, do those who speak thus [127] say what has been said by the
Blessed One, and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact?
Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that
nothing that provides a ground for censure can be legitimately
deduced from their assertions?”</P>
<P  >“Great
King, those who speak thus do not say what has been said by me, but
misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed General Vidudabha: “General,
who introduced this story into the palace?”</P>
<P  >“It
was Sanjaya, sire, the brahmin of the Akasa clan.”</P>
<P  >7.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala told a man: “Come, good man, in my
name tell Sanjaya, the brahmin of the Akasa clan: ‘Venerable sir,
King Pasenadi of Kosala calls you.’“</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sire,” the man replied. He went to Sanjaya, the brahmin of the
Akasa clan, and told him: “Venerable sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala
calls you.”</P>
<P  >8.
Meanwhile King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Venerable
sir, could something else have been said by the Blessed One referring
to that, and the person understood it wrongly? In what way does the
Blessed One recall making that utterance?”</P>
<P  >“I
recall having actually made the utterance in this way, great king:
‘There is no recluse or brahmin who knows all, who sees all,
simultaneously; that is not possible.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote846anc" HREF="#sdendnote846sym"><SUP>dcccxlvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“What
the Blessed One has said appears reasonable, what the Blessed One has
said appears to be supported by reason: ‘There</P>
<P  >is
no recluse or brahmin [128] who knows all, who sees all,
simultaneously; that is not possible.’“</P>
<P  >9.
“There are these four castes, venerable sir: the nobles, the
brahmins, the merchants, and the workers. Is there any distinction or
difference among them?”</P>
<P  >“There
are these four castes, great king: the nobles, the brahmins, the
merchants, and the workers. Two of them, that is, the nobles and the
brahmins, are held to be superior since men pay homage to them, rise
up for them, and accord them reverential salutation and polite
services.”</P>
<P  >10.
“Venerable sir, I was not asking about this present life; I was
asking about the life to come.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote847anc" HREF="#sdendnote847sym"><SUP>dcccxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
There are these four castes, venerable sir: the nobles, the brahmins,
the merchants, and the workers. Is there any distinction or
difference among them?”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, there are these five factors of striving.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote848anc" HREF="#sdendnote848sym"><SUP>dcccxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
What five? Here a bhikkhu has faith, he places his faith in the
Tathagata’s enlightenment thus: ‘The Blessed One is accomplished,
fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime,
knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher
of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’ Then he is free from
illness and affliction, possessing a good digestion that is neither
too cool nor too warm but medium and able to bear the strain of
striving. Then he is honest and sincere, and shows himself as he
actually is to his teacher and his companions in the holy life. Then
he is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in undertaking
wholesome states, steadfast, launching his effort with firmness and
persevering in cultivating wholesome states. Then he is wise; he
possesses wisdom regarding rise and disappearance that is noble and
penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. These
are the five factors of striving.</P>
<P  >“There
are these four castes, great king: the nobles, the brahmins, the
merchants, and the workers. Now if they possessed these five factors
of striving, it would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long
time.”</P>
<P  >11.
“Venerable sir, there are these four castes: the nobles, the
brahmins, the merchants, [129] and the workers. Now if they possessed
these five factors of striving, would there be any difference among
them here in that respect?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
great king, I say that the difference among them would lie in the
diversity of their striving. Suppose there were two tamable elephants
or tamable horses or tamable oxen that were well tamed and well
disciplined, and two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable
oxen that were untamed and undisciplined. What do you think, great
king? Would the two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable
oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined, being tamed, acquire
the behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of the
tamed?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“And
would the two tamable elephants or tamable horses or tamable oxen
that were untamed and undisciplined, being untamed, acquire the
behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of the tamed,
like the two elephants or horses or oxen that were well tamed and
well disciplined?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, great king, it is not possible that what can be achieved by one
who has faith, who is free from illness, who is honest and sincere,
who is energetic, and who is wise, can be achieved by one who has no
faith, who has much illness, who is fraudulent and deceitful, who is
lazy, and who is not wise.”</P>
<P  >12.
“What the Blessed One has said appears reasonable, what the Blessed
One has said appears to be supported by reason.</P>
<P  >“There
are these four castes, venerable sir: the nobles, the brahmins, the
merchants, and the workers. Now if they possessed these five factors
of striving, and if their striving was right, would there be any
difference among them in that respect?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
great king, in this respect I say that among them there is no
difference, that is, between the deliverance of one and the
deliverance of the others. Suppose a man took dry saka wood, lit a
fire, and produced heat; and then another man took dry sala wood, lit
a fire, and produced heat; [130] and then another man took dry mango
wood, lit a fire, and produced heat; and then another man took dry
fig wood, lit a fire, and produced heat. What do you think, great
king? Would there be any difference among these fires lit with
different kinds of wood, that is, between the flame of one and the
flames of the others, or between the colour of one and the colours of
the others, or between the radiance of one and the radiances of the
others?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, great king, when a fire is kindled by energy, lit by striving,
there is, I say, no difference, that is, between the deliverance of
one and the deliverance of the others.”</P>
<P  >13.
“What the Blessed One has said appears reasonable, what the Blessed
One has said appears to be supported by reason. But, venerable sir,
how is it: are there gods?”</P>
<P  >“Why
do you ask that, great king?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I was asking whether those gods come back to this [human] state
or whether they do not.”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, those gods who are still subject to affliction come back to
this [human] state, those gods who are no longer subject to
affliction do not come back to this [human] state.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote849anc" HREF="#sdendnote849sym"><SUP>dcccxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
When this was said, General Vidudabha asked the Blessed One:
“Venerable sir, can those gods who are still subject to affliction
and who come back to this [human] state topple or banish from that
place those gods who are no longer subject to affliction and who do
not come back to this [human] state?”</P>
<P  >Then
the venerable Ananda thought: “This General Vidudabha is the son of
King Pasenadi of Kosala, and I am the son of the Blessed One. This is
the time for one son to talk with the other.” He said to General
Vidudabha: “General, I shall ask you a question in return. Answer
it as you choose. General, what do you think? There is the whole
extent of King Pasenadi of Kosala’s realm, where [131] he exercises
lordship and sovereignty; now can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple or
banish from that place any recluse or brahmin, irrespective of
whether that recluse or brahmin has merit or not and whether he leads
the</P>
<P  >holy
life or not?”</P>
<P  >“He
can do so, sir.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, general? There is the whole extent that is not King
Pasenadi of Kosala’s realm, where he does not exercise lordship and
sovereignty; now can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple or banish from
that place any recluse or brahmin, irrespective of whether that
recluse or brahmin has merit or not and whether he leads the holy
life or not?”</P>
<P  >“He
cannot do so, sir.”</P>
<P  >“General,
what do you think? Have you heard of the gods of the Thirty-three?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir, I have heard of them. And King Pasenadi of Kosala has heard of
them too.”</P>
<P  >“General,
what do you think? Can King Pasenadi of Kosala topple the gods of the
Thirty-three or banish them from that place?”</P>
<P  >“Sir,
King Pasenadi of Kosala cannot even see the gods of the Thirty-three,
so how could he topple them or banish them from that place?”</P>
<P  >“So
too, general, those gods who are still subject to affliction and who
come back to this [human] state cannot even see those gods who are no
longer subject to affliction and who do not come back to this [human]
state; so how could they topple them or banish them from that place?”</P>
<P  >15.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala asked the Blessed One: “Venerable sir,
what is this bhikkhu’s name?”</P>
<P  >“His
name is Ananda, great king.”</P>
<P  >“Ananda
[joy] he is indeed, venerable sir, and Ananda he appears. What [132]
the venerable Ananda has said appears reasonable, what he has said
appears to be supported by reason. But, venerable sir, how is it: are
there Brahmas?”</P>
<P  >“Why
do you ask that, great king?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I was asking whether those Brahmas come back to this [human]
state or whether they do not.”</P>
<P  >“Great
king, any Brahma who is still subject to affliction comes back to
this [human] state, any Brahma who is no longer subject to affliction
does not come back to this [human] state.”</P>
<P  >16.
Then a man announced to King Pasenadi of Kosala: “Great king,
Sanjaya, the brahmin of the Akasa clan, has come.”</P>
<P  >King
Pasenadi of Kosala asked Sanjaya, the brahmin of the Akasa clan:
“Brahmin, who introduced this story to the palace?”</P>
<P  >“Sire,
it was General Vidudabha.”</P>
<P  >General
Vidudabha said: “Sire, it was Sanjaya, the brahmin of the Akasa
clan.”</P>
<P  >17.
Then a man announced to King Pasenadi of Kosala: “Sire, it is time
to depart.”</P>
<P  >King
Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, we have
asked the Blessed One about omniscience, and the Blessed One has
answered about omniscience; we approve of and accept that answer, and
so we are satisfied. We have asked the Blessed One about purification
in the four castes, and the</P>
<P  >Blessed
One has answered about purification in the four castes; we approve of
and accept that answer, and so we are satisfied. We have asked the
Blessed One about the gods, and the Blessed One has answered about
the gods; we approve of and accept that answer, and so we are
satisfied. We have asked the Blessed One about the Brahmas, and the
Blessed One has answered about the Brahmas; we approve of and accept
that answer, and so we are satisfied. Whatever we asked the Blessed
One, that the Blessed One has answered; we approve of and accept
those answers, and so we are satisfied. [133] And now, venerable sir,
we depart. We are busy and have much to do.”</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time, great king, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >18.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to
the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.</P>

91. Brahmayu Sutta - Brahmayu</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with
five hundred bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Brahmayu was living at Mithila. He
was old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the
last stage; he was in his hundred and twentieth year. He was a master
of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and
etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and
grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks
of a Great Man.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote850anc" HREF="#sdendnote850sym"><SUP>dcccl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
The brahmin Brahmayu heard: “The recluse Gotama, the son of the
Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been wandering in the
country of the Videhans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with five
hundred bhikkhus. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread
to this effect: ‘The Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with
its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, this generation with its
recluses and brahmins, with its princes and its people, which he has
himself realised with direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma that is
good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with
the right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is
utterly perfect and pure.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.”
[134]</P>
<P  >4.
Now at that time the brahmin Brahmayu had a young Brahmin student
named Uttara who was a master of the Three Vedas … fully versed in
natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. He told his
student: “My dear Uttara, the recluse Gotama, the son of the
Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan</P>
<P  >clan,
has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large Sangha
of bhikkhus, with five hundred bhikkhus … Now it is good to see
such arahants. Come, my dear Uttara, go to the recluse Gotama and
find out whether the report spread about him is true or not, and
whether Master Gotama is one such as this or not. Thus we shall know
about Master Gotama through you.”</P>
<P  >5.
“But how shall I find out, sir, whether the report spread about
Master Gotama is true or not, and whether Master Gotama is one such
as this or not?”</P>
<P  >“My
dear Uttara, the thirty-two marks of a Great Man have been handed
down in our hymns, and the Great Man who is endowed with them has
only two possible destinies, no other.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote851anc" HREF="#sdendnote851sym"><SUP>dcccli</SUP></A></SUP>
If he lives the home life, he becomes a Wheel-turning Monarch, a
righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, master of the four quarters,
all-victorious, who has stabilised his country and possesses the
seven treasures. He has these seven treasures: the wheel-treasure,
the elephant-treasure, the horse-treasure, the jewel-treasure, the
woman-treasure, the steward-treasure, and the counsellor-treasure as
the seventh.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote852anc" HREF="#sdendnote852sym"><SUP>dccclii</SUP></A></SUP>
His children, who exceed a thousand, are brave and heroic, and crush
the armies of others; over this earth bounded by the ocean, he rules
without a rod, without a weapon, by means of the Dhamma. But if he
goes forth from the home life into homelessness, he becomes an
Accomplished One, a Fully Enlightened One, who draws aside the veil
in the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote853anc" HREF="#sdendnote853sym"><SUP>dcccliii</SUP></A></SUP>
But I, my dear Uttara, am the giver of the hymns; you are the
receiver of them.”</P>
<P  >6.
“Yes, sir,” he replied. He rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to the brahmin Brahmayu, keeping him on his right, he left for
the country of the Videhans, where the Blessed One was wandering.
[135] Travelling by stages, he came to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and looked for the thirty-two marks
of a Great Man on the Blessed One’s body. He saw, more or less, the
thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One’s body, except
two; he was doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he
could not decide and make up his mind about them: about the male
organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the
tongue.</P>
<P  >Then
it occurred to the Blessed One: “This brahmin student Uttara sees,
more or less, the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on me, except two;
he is doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he cannot
decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being
enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue.”</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the
Brahmin student Uttara saw that the Blessed One’s male organ was
enclosed in a sheath.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote854anc" HREF="#sdendnote854sym"><SUP>dcccliv</SUP></A></SUP>
Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue, and he repeatedly touched
both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered the whole of his
forehead with his tongue.</P>
<P  >8.
Then the brahmin student Uttara thought: “The recluse Gotama is
endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Man. Suppose I were to
follow the recluse Gotama and observe his behaviour?”</P>
<P  >Then
he followed the Blessed One for seven months like a shadow, never
leaving him. At the end of the seven months in the country of the
Videhans, he set out to journey to Mithila where the brahmin Brahmayu
was. When he arrived, he paid homage to him and sat down at one side.
Thereupon, the brahmin Brahmayu asked him: “Well, my dear Uttara,
is the report that has been spread about Master Gotama [136] true or
not? And is Master Gotama one such as this or not?”</P>
<P  >9.
“The report that has been spread about Master Gotama is true, sir,
and not otherwise; and Master Gotama is one such as this and not
otherwise. He possesses the thirty-two marks of a Great Man.</P>
<P  >Master
Gotama sets his foot down squarely - this is a mark of a Great Man in

Man in Master Gotama.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote857anc" HREF="#sdendnote857sym"><SUP>dccclvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Master
Gotama is endowed with these thirty-two marks of a Great Man.</P>
<P  >10.
“When he walks, he steps out with the right foot first. He does not
extend his foot too far or put it down too near. He walks neither too
quickly nor too slowly. He walks without his knees knocking together.
He walks without his ankles knocking together. He walks without
raising or lowering his thighs, or bringing them together or keeping
them apart. When he walks, only the lower part of his body
oscillates, and he does not walk with bodily effort. When he turns to
look, he does so with his whole body. He does not look straight up;
he does not look straight down. He does not walk looking about. He
looks a plough-yoke’s length before him; beyond that he has
unhindered knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >11.
“When he goes indoors, he does not raise or lower his body, or bend
it forward or back. [138] He turns round neither too far from the
seat nor too near it. He does not lean on the seat with his hand. He
does not throw his body onto the seat.</P>
<P  >12.
“When seated indoors, he does not fidget with his hands. He does
not fidget with his feet. He does not sit with his knees crossed. He
does not sit with his ankles crossed. He does not sit with his hand
holding his chin. When seated indoors he is not afraid, he does not
shiver and tremble, he is not nervous. Being unafraid, not shivering
or trembling or nervous, his hair does not stand up and he is intent
on seclusion.</P>
<P  >13.
“When he receives the water for the bowl, he does not raise or
lower the bowl or tip it forwards or backwards. He receives neither
too little nor too much water for the bowl. He washes the bowl
without making a splashing noise. He washes the bowl without turning
it round. He does not put the bowl on the floor to wash his hands:
when his hands are washed, the bowl is washed; and when the bowl is
washed, his hands are washed. He pours the water for the bowl neither
too far nor too near and he does not pour it about.</P>
<P  >14.
“When he receives rice, he does not raise or lower the bowl or tip
it forwards or backwards. He receives neither too little rice nor too
much rice. He adds sauces in the right proportion; he does not exceed
the right amount of sauce in the mouthful. He turns the mouthful over
two or three times in his mouth and then swallows it, and no rice
kernel enters his body unchewed, and no rice kernel remains in his
mouth; then he takes another mouthful. He takes his food experiencing
the taste, though not experiencing greed for the taste. The food he
takes has eight factors: it is neither for amusement nor for
intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness,
but only for the endurance and continuance of his body, for the
ending of discomfort, and for assisting the holy life; [139] he
considers: ‘Thus I shall terminate old feelings without arousing
new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in
comfort.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote858anc" HREF="#sdendnote858sym"><SUP>dccclviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
“When he has eaten and receives water for the bowl, he does not
raise or lower the bowl or tip it forwards or backwards.</P>
<P  >He
receives neither too little nor too much water for the bowl. He
washes the bowl without making a splashing noise. He washes the bowl
without turning it round. He does not put the bowl on the floor to
wash his hands: when his hands are washed, the bowl is washed; and
when the bowl is washed, his hands are washed. He pours the water for
the bowl neither too far nor too near and he does not pour it about.</P>
<P  >16.
“When he has eaten, he puts the bowl on the floor neither too far
nor too near; and he is neither careless of the bowl nor
over-solicitous about it.</P>
<P  >17.
“When he has eaten, he sits in silence for a while, but he does not
let the time for the blessing go by.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote859anc" HREF="#sdendnote859sym"><SUP>dccclix</SUP></A></SUP>
When he has eaten and gives the blessing, he does not do so
criticising the meal or expecting another meal; he instructs, urges,
rouses, and encourages that audience with talk purely on the Dhamma.
When he has done so, he rises from his seat and departs.</P>
<P  >18.
“He walks neither too fast nor too slow, and he does not go as one
who wants to get away.</P>
<P  >19.
“His robe is worn neither too high nor too low on his body, nor too
tight against his body, nor too loose on his body, nor does the wind
blow his robe away from his body. Dust and dirt do not soil his body.</P>
<P  >20.
“When he has gone to the monastery, he sits down on a seat made
ready. Having sat down, he washes his feet, though he does not
concern himself with grooming his feet. Having washed his feet, he
seats himself cross-legged, sets his body erect, and establishes
mindfulness in front of him. He does not occupy his mind with
self-affliction, or the affliction of others, or the affliction of
both; he sits with his mind set on his own welfare, on the welfare of
others, and on the welfare of both, even on the welfare of the whole
world. [140]</P>
<P  >21.
“When he has gone to the monastery, he teaches the Dhamma to an
audience. He neither flatters nor berates that audience; he
instructs, urges, rouses, and encourages it with talk purely on the
Dhamma. The speech that issues from his mouth has eight qualities: it
is distinct, intelligible, melodious, audible, ringing, euphonious,
deep, and sonorous. But while his voice is intelligible as far as the
audience extends, his speech does not issue out beyond the audience.
When the people have been instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged
by him, they rise from their seats and depart looking only at him and
concerned with nothing else.</P>
<P  >22.
“We have seen Master Gotama walking, sir, we have seen him
standing, we have seen him entering indoors, we have seen him indoors
seated in silence after eating, we have seen him giving the blessing
after eating, we have seen him going to the monastery in silence, we
have seen him in the monastery teaching the Dhamma to an audience.
Such is the Master Gotama; such he is, and more than that. “<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote860anc" HREF="#sdendnote860sym"><SUP>dccclx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
When this was said, the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat, and
after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder, he extended his hands
in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and uttered this
exclamation three times: “Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished
and fully enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and
fully enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened! Perhaps sometime or other we might meet Master Gotama,
perhaps we might have some conversation with him.”</P>
<P  >24.
Then, in the course of his wandering, the Blessed One eventually
arrived at Mithila. There the Blessed One lived in Makhadeva’s
Mango Grove. The brahmin householders of Mithila heard: [141] “The
recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan
clan, has been wandering in the country of the Videhans with a large
Sangha of bhikkhus, with five hundred bhikkhus, and he has now come
to Mithila and is living in Makhadeva’s Mango Grove. Now a good
report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect … (as in §3
above) … Now it is good to see such arahants.”</P>
<P  >25.
Then the brahmin householders of Mithila went to the Blessed One.
Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their hands in
reverential salutation towards him and sat down at one side; some
pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One’s presence and
sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at one side.</P>
<P  >26.
The brahmin Brahmayu heard: “The recluse Gotama, the son of the
Sakyans who went forth from the Sakyan clan, has arrived in Mithila
and is living in Makhadeva’s Mango Grove in Mithila.”</P>
<P  >Then
the brahmin Brahmayu went to Makhadeva’s Mango Grove with a number
of brahmin students. When he came to the Mango Grove, he thought: “It
is not proper that I should go to the recluse Gotama without first
being announced.” Then he addressed a certain brahmin student:
“Come, brahmin student, go to the recluse Gotama and ask in my name
whether the recluse Gotama is free from illness and affliction, and
is healthy, strong, and abiding in comfort, saying: ‘Master Gotama,
the brahmin Brahmayu asks whether Master Gotama is free from illness
… abiding in comfort,’ and say this: ‘The brahmin Brahmayu,
Master Gotama, is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life,
and come to the last stage; he is in his hundred and twentieth year.
He is a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy,
phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in
philology and grammar, he is fully versed in natural philosophy and
in the marks of a Great Man. Of all the brahmin householders who live
in Mithila, the brahmin Brahmayu is pronounced the foremost of them
in wealth, in knowledge of the hymns, and in age and fame. [142] He
wants to see Master Gotama.’“</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir,” the brahmin student replied. He went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he stood at one side and delivered his message.
[The Blessed One said:]</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time for the brahmin Brahmayu to do as he thinks fit.”</P>
<P  >27.
Then the brahmin student went to the brahmin Brahmayu and said:
“Permission has been granted by the recluse Gotama. Now is the
time, sir, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >So
the brahmin Brahmayu went to the Blessed One. The assembly saw him
coming in the distance, and they at once made way for him as for one
who was well known and famous. Then the brahmin Brahmayu said to the
assembly: “Enough, sirs, let each sit down in his own seat. I shall
sit here next to the recluse Gotama.”</P>
<P  >28.
Then he went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him, and
when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the
Blessed One’s body. [143] He saw, more or less, the thirty-two
marks of a Great Man on the Blessed</P>
<P  >One’s
body, except two; he was doubtful about two of the marks, and he
could not decide and make up his mind about them: about the male
organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the
tongue.</P>
<P  >29.
Then the brahmin Brahmayu addressed the Blessed One in stanzas:</P>
<P >
“The two-and-thirty marks I learned</P>
<P >
That are the signs of a Great Man –</P>
<P >
I still do not see two of these</P>
<P >
Upon your body, Gotama.</P>
<P >
Is what should be concealed by cloth</P>
<P >
Hid in a sheath, greatest of men?</P>
<P >
Though called by a word of feminine gender,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote861anc" HREF="#sdendnote861sym"><SUP>dccclxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
Perhaps your tongue is a manly one?</P>
<P >
Perhaps your tongue is large as well,</P>
<P >
According to what we have been taught?</P>
<P >
Please put it out a little bit</P>
<P >
And so, O Seer, cure our doubt</P>
<P >
For welfare in this very life</P>
<P >
And happiness in lives to come.</P>
<P >
And now we crave for leave to ask</P>
<P >
Something that we aspire to know.”</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >30.
Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “This brahmin Brahmayu sees,
more or less, the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on me, except two;
he is doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he cannot
decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being
enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue.”</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the
brahmin Brahmayu saw that the Blessed One’s male organ was enclosed
in a sheath. Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue, and he
repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered
the whole of his forehead with his tongue.</P>
<P  >31.
Then the Blessed One spoke these stanzas in reply to the brahmin
Brahmayu:</P>
<P >
“The two-and-thirty marks you learned</P>
<P >
That are the signs of a Great Man –</P>
<P >
All on my body can be found:</P>
<P >
So, brahmin, doubt no more on that.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
What must be known is directly known,</P>
<P >
What must be developed has been developed,</P>
<P >
What must be abandoned has been abandoned,</P>
<P >
Therefore, brahmin, I am a Buddha.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote862anc" HREF="#sdendnote862sym"><SUP>dccclxii</SUP></A></SUP>
[144]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
For welfare in this very life</P>
<P >
And happiness in lives to come,</P>
<P >
Since leave is given you, please ask</P>
<P >
Whatever you aspire to know.”</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >32.
Then the brahmin Brahmayu thought: “Permission has been granted me
by the recluse Gotama. Which should I ask him about: good in this
life or good in the lives to come?” Then he thought: “I am
skilled in the good of this life, and others too ask me about good in
this life. Why shouldn’t I ask him only about good in the lives to
come?” Then he addressed the Blessed One in stanzas:</P>
<P >
“How does one become a brahmin?</P>
<P >
And how does one attain to knowledge?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote863anc" HREF="#sdendnote863sym"><SUP>dccclxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
How has one the triple knowledge?</P>
<P >
And how does one become a holy scholar?</P>
<P >
How does one become an arahant?</P>
<P >
And how does one attain completeness?</P>
<P >
How is one a silent sage?</P>
<P >
And how can one be called a Buddha?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote864anc" HREF="#sdendnote864sym"><SUP>dccclxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >33.
Then the Blessed One spoke these stanzas in reply:</P>
<P >
“Who knows about his former lives,</P>
<P >
Sees heaven and states of deprivation,</P>
<P >
And has arrived at birth’s destruction –</P>
<P >
A sage who knows by direct knowledge,</P>
<P >
Who knows his mind is purified,</P>
<P >
Entirely freed from every lust,</P>
<P >
Who has abandoned birth and death,</P>
<P >
Who is complete in the holy life,</P>
<P >
Who has transcended everything –</P>
<P >
One such as this is called a Buddha.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote865anc" HREF="#sdendnote865sym"><SUP>dccclxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >34.
When this was said, the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat, and
after arranging his upper robe on one shoulder, he prostrated himself
with his head at the Blessed One’s feet, and he covered the Blessed
One’s feet with kisses and caressed them with his hands,
pronouncing his name: “I am the brahmin Brahmayu, Master Gotama; I
am the brahmin Brahmayu, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >35.
Those in the assembly wondered and marvelled, and they said: “It is
wonderful, sirs, it is marvellous, what great power and great might
the recluse Gotama has, for the well-known and famous brahmin
Brahmayu to make such a display of humility!”</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One said to the brahmin Brahmayu: [145] “Enough,
brahmin, arise; sit down in your own seat since your mind has
confidence in me.”</P>
<P  >The
brahmin Brahmayu then rose and sat down in his own seat.</P>
<P  >36.
The Blessed One then gave him progressive instruction,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote866anc" HREF="#sdendnote866sym"><SUP>dccclxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
that is, talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on the heavens; he
explained the danger, degradation, and defilement in sensual
pleasures and the blessing of renunciation. When he knew that the
brahmin Brahmayu’s mind was ready, receptive, free from hindrances,
elated, and confident, he expounded to him the teaching special to
the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just
as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye evenly, so
too, while the brahmin Brahmayu sat there, the spotless immaculate
vision of the Dhamma arose in him: “All that is subject to arising
is subject to cessation.” Then the brahmin Brahmayu saw the Dhamma,
attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma; he
crossed beyond doubt, did away with perplexity, gained intrepidity,
and became independent of others in the Teacher’s Dispensation.</P>
<P  >37.
Then he said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama!
Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear
in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been
overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was
lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see
forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the
Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay
follower who has gone to him for refuge for life. Let the Blessed
One, together with the Sangha of bhikkhus, consent to accept
tomorrow’s meal from me.”</P>
<P  >The
Blessed One consented in silence. Then, knowing that the Blessed One
had consented, the brahmin Brahmayu rose from his seat, and after
paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he
departed.</P>
<P  >38.
Then, when the night had ended, the Brahmin Brahmayu had good food of
various kinds prepared in his residence, and he had the time
announced to the Blessed One: “It is time, Master Gotama, the meal
is ready.” [146]</P>
<P  >Then,
it being morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and
outer robe, he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the brahmin
Brahmayu’s residence and sat down on the seat made ready. Then, for
a week, with his own hands, the Brahmin Brahmayu served and satisfied
the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of
good food.</P>
<P  >39.
At the end of that week, the Blessed One set out to wander in the
country of the Videhans. Soon after he had gone, the brahmin Brahmayu
died. Then a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and said: “Venerable
sir, the brahmin Brahmayu has died. What is his destination? What is
his future course?”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhus,
the brahmin Brahmayu was wise, he entered into the way of the Dhamma,
and he did not trouble me in the interpretation of the Dhamma. With
the destruction of the five lower fetters, he has reappeared
spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and will there attain final
Nibbana, without ever returning from that world.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote867anc" HREF="#sdendnote867sym"><SUP>dccclxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the country of the
Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, [102] with twelve
hundred and fifty bhikkhus, and eventually he arrived at a town of
the Anguttarapans named Apana.</P>
<P  >2.
The matted-hair ascetic Keniya heard: “The recluse Gotama, the son
of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been wandering
in the country of the Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus,
with twelve hundred and fifty [103] bhikkhus, and he has come to
Apana. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this
effect … (as Sutta 91, §3) … Now it is good to see such
arahants.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then the matted-hair ascetic Keniya went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One
instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged him with a talk on the
Dhamma. Then, having been instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged
by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma, the matted-hair ascetic
Keniya said to the Blessed One: “Let Master Gotama together with
the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the Blessed One told him: “The Sangha of bhikkhus is
large, Keniya, [104] consisting of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus,
and you place full confidence in the brahmins.”</P>
<P  >A
second time the matted-hair ascetic Keniya said to the Blessed One:
“Although the Sangha of bhikkhus is large, Master Gotama,
consisting of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus, and although I place
full confidence in the brahmins, still let Master Gotama, together
with the Sangha of bhikkhus, consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from
me.” A second time the Blessed One told him: “The Sangha of
bhikkhus is large, Keniya … ”</P>
<P  >A
third time the matted-hair ascetic Keniya said to the Blessed One:
“Although the Sangha is large, Master Gotama … still let Master
Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept
tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Blessed One consented in silence.</P>
<P  >4.
Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, the matted-hair
ascetic Keniya rose from his seat and went to his own hermitage where
he addressed his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives
thus: “Hear me, sirs, my friends and companions, my kinsmen and
relatives. The recluse Gotama has been invited by me for tomorrow’s
meal together with the Sangha of bhikkhus. Make the necessary
purchases and preparations for me.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir,” they replied, and some dug out ovens, some chopped wood, some
washed dishes, some set out water jugs, some prepared seats, while
the matted-hair ascetic Keniya himself set up a pavilion.</P>
<P  >5.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Sela was staying at Apana. [105] He
was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy,
phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in
philology and grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and
in the marks of a Great Man, and was teaching the recitation of the
hymns to three hundred brahmin students.</P>
<P  >6.
At the time the matted-hair ascetic Keniya had placed full confidence
in the brahmin Sela. Then the brahmin Sela, while walking and
wandering for exercise attended by his three hundred brahmin
students, came to the matted-hair ascetic Kenya’s hermitage. There
he saw some men digging out ovens, some chopping wood, some washing
dishes, some setting out water jugs, some preparing seats, while the
matted-hair ascetic Keniya himself was setting up a pavilion.</P>
<P  >7.
When he saw this, he asked the matted-hair ascetic Keniya: “What,
is Master Keniya to hold a marriage or a giving in marriage? Or is
there some great sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha
been invited with a large retinue for tomorrow’s meal?”</P>
<P  >8.
“I will not be holding a marriage or a giving in marriage, Master
Sela, nor has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha been invited with a
large retinue for tomorrow’s meal, but I am planning a great
sacrifice. The recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth
from a Sakyan clan, has been wandering in the country of the
Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with twelve hundred
and fifty bhikkhus, and has come to Apana. [106] Now a good report of
Master Gotama has been spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened [buddha], blessed.’
He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the
Sangha of bhikkhus.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Did you say ‘Buddha,’ Keniya?”</P>
<P  >“I
said ‘Buddha,’ Sela.”</P>
<P  >“Did
you say ‘Buddha,’ Keniya?”</P>
<P  >“I
said ‘Buddha,’ Sela.”</P>
<P  >10.
Then it occurred to the brahmin Sela: “Even this word ‘Buddha’
is hard to come across in this world. Now the thirtytwo marks of a
Great Man have been handed down in our hymns, and the Great Man who
is endowed with them has only two possible destinies, no other. If he
lives the home life he becomes a Wheel-turning Monarch, a righteous
king who rules by the Dhamma, master of the four quarters,
all-victorious, who has stabilised his country and possesses the
seven treasures. He has these seven treasures: the wheel-treasure,
the elephanttreasure, the horse-treasure, the jewel-treasure, the
womantreasure, the steward-treasure, and the counsellor-treasure as
the seventh. His children, who exceed a thousand, are brave and
heroic and crush the armies of others; over this earth bounded by the
ocean he rules without a rod, without a weapon, by means of the
Dhamma. But if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness, he
becomes an Accomplished One, a Fully Enlightened One, who draws aside
the veil in the world.”</P>
<P  >11.
[He said]: “My good Keniya, where is Master Gotama, the
Accomplished One, the Fully Enlightened One, now living?”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the matted-hair ascetic Keniya extended his right arm
and said: [107] “There, where that green line of the grove is,
Master Sela.”</P>
<P  >12.
Then the brahmin Sela went with the three hundred Brahmin students to
the Blessed One. He addressed the brahmin students: “Come quietly,
sirs, tread carefully; for these Blessed</P>
<P  >Ones
are difficult to approach, they wander alone like lions. When I am
speaking with the recluse Gotama, do not break in and interrupt me,
but wait until our talk is finished.”</P>
<P  >13.
Then the brahmin Sela went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings
with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat
down at one side and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man
on the Blessed One’s body. He saw, more or less, the thirty-two
marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One’s body, except two; he was
doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he could not
decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being
enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue.</P>
<P  >Then
it occurred to the Blessed One: “This brahmin Sela sees the
thirty-two marks of a Great Man on me, except two; he is doubtful and
uncertain about two of the marks, and he cannot decide and make up
his mind about them: about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath
and about the largeness of the tongue.”</P>
<P  >14.
Then the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the
brahmin Sela saw that the Blessed One’s male organ was enclosed in
a sheath. [108] Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue, and he
repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered
the whole of his forehead with his tongue.</P>
<P  >15.
Then the brahmin Sela thought: “The recluse Gotama is endowed with
the thirty-two marks of a Great Man; they are complete, not

I have heard from elder aged brahmins who speak according to the
lineage of teachers that those who are the Accomplished Ones, Fully
Enlightened Ones, reveal themselves as such when their praise is
spoken. Suppose I extol the recluse Gotama to his face with fitting
stanzas.”</P>
<P  >Then
he extolled the Blessed One to his face with fitting stanzas:</P>

“There are three hundred brahmins here</P>

Who with uplifted hands implore:</P>

‘O may we live the holy life</P>

Under you, O Blessed One.’“</P>

Buddha</P>
<P >
“The holy life is well proclaimed,</P>
<P >
O Sela,” said the Blessed One,</P>
<P >
“To be seen here and not delayed;</P>
<P >
One who trains with diligence</P>
<P >
Will find a fruitful going forth.”</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >24.
Then the brahmin Sela and his assembly received the going forth under
the Blessed One, and they received the full admission.</P>
<P  >25.
Then, when the night had ended, the matted-hair ascetic Keniya had
good food of various kinds prepared in his own hermitage [111] and
had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It is time, Master
Gotama, the meal is ready.” Then, it being morning, the Blessed One
dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went with the Sangha
of bhikkhus to the hermitage of the matted-hair ascetic Keniya and
sat down on the seat made ready. Then, with his own hands, the
matted-hair ascetic Keniya served and satisfied the Sangha of
bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of good food. When
the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl,
the matted-hair ascetic Keniya took a low seat and sat down on one
side. Thereupon the Blessed One gave him his blessing with these
stanzas:</P>
<P  >26.
“Burnt
offerings are the glory of fires,</P>
<P >
Savitri the glory of Vedic hymns,</P>
<P >
Glory of human beings, a king,</P>
<P >
Glory of flowing rivers, the sea;</P>
<P >
The moon is the glory of the stars,</P>
<P >
The sun is the glory of all that shine;</P>
<P >
Merit is the glory of all who aspire;</P>
<P >
The Sangha, glory of those who give.”</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >When
the Blessed One had given his blessing with these stanzas, he rose
from his seat and departed.</P>
<P  >27.
Then, not long after their full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn,
diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Sela and his assembly,
[112] by realising for themselves with direct knowledge, here and now
entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the
sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into
homelessness. They directly knew: “Birth is destroyed, the holy
life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no
more coming to any state of being.” And the venerable Sela together
with his assembly became arahants.</P>
<P  >28.
‘Then the venerable Sela together with his assembly went to the
Blessed One. Having arranged his upper robe on one shoulder,
extending his hands in reverential greeting towards the Blessed One,
he addressed him with these stanzas:</P>
<P  >“Eight
days have passed, All-Seeing One, Since we went to you for refuge. In
these seven nights, O Blessed One, We have been tamed in your
teaching.</P>
<P  >You
are the Buddha, you are the Teacher, You are the Sage, the conqueror
of Mara. Having cut off all evil tendencies,</P>
<P  >You
have crossed and guide humanity across.</P>
<P  >You
have surmounted all attachments, You have removed all the taints. You
are a lion free from clinging, You have abandoned fear and dread.</P>
<P  >Here
these three hundred bhikkhus stand With hands held out in adoration.
O Hero, extend your feet,</P>

let these great beings worship the Teacher.”</P>

93. Assalayana Sutta - To Assalayana</H2>
<P  >[147]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now at that time five hundred brahmins from diverse provinces were
staying at Savatthi for some business or other. Then those brahmins
thought: “This recluse Gotama describes purification for all the
four castes.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote869anc" HREF="#sdendnote869sym"><SUP>dccclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Who is there able to dispute with him about this assertion?”</P>
<P  >3.
Now on that occasion a brahmin student named Assalayana was staying
at Savatthi. Young, shaven-headed, sixteen years old, he was a master
of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and
etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and
grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks
of a Great Man. Then the brahmins thought: “There is this young
brahmin student named Assalayana staying at Savatthi. Young … fully
versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. He will
be able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion.”</P>
<P  >4.
So the brahmins went to the brahmin student Assalayana and said to
him: “Master Assalayana, this recluse Gotama describes purification
for all the four castes. Let Master Assalayana come and dispute with
the recluse Gotama about this assertion.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana replied: “Sirs, the
recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the
Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with
the recluse Gotama about this assertion.”</P>
<P  >A
second time the brahmins said to him: “Master Assalayana, this
recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Let
Master Assalayana come [148] and dispute with the recluse Gotama
about this assertion. For the training of a wanderer has been
completed by Master Assalayana.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote870anc" HREF="#sdendnote870sym"><SUP>dccclxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >For
the second time the brahmin student Assalayana replied: “Sirs, the
recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the
Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with
the recluse Gotama about this assertion.”</P>
<P  >A
third time the brahmins said to him: “Master Assalayana, this
recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Let
Master Assalayana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this
assertion. For the training of a wanderer has been completed by
Master Assalayana. Let not the Master Assalayana be defeated without
having even fought the battle.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana replied: “Sirs, the
recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the
Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with
the recluse Gotama about this assertion. Still, sirs, at your bidding
I will go.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then the brahmin student Assalayana went with a large number of
brahmin to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When
this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side
and said to the Blessed One: “Master Gotama, the brahmins say thus:
‘Brahmins are the highest caste, those of any other caste are
inferior; brahmins are the fairest caste, those of any other caste
are dark; only brahmins are purified, not non-brahmins; brahmins
alone are the sons of Brahma, the offspring of Brahma, born of his
mouth, born of Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of Brahma.’ What
does Master Gotama say about that?”</P>
<P  >“Now,
Assalayana, the brahmin women are seen having their periods, becoming
pregnant, giving birth, and giving suck.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote871anc" HREF="#sdendnote871sym"><SUP>dccclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
And yet those who are born from the wombs of the brahmin women say
thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste … brahmins alone are the
sons of Brahma, the offspring of Brahma, born of his mouth, born of
Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of Brahma.’“[149]</P>
<P  >6.
“Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus:
‘Brahmins are the highest caste … heirs of Brahma.’“</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, Assalayana? Have you heard that in Yona and Kamboja<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote872anc" HREF="#sdendnote872sym"><SUP>dccclxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
and in other outland countries there are</P>
<P  >only
two castes, masters and slaves, and that masters become slaves and
slaves masters?”</P>
<P  >“So
I have heard, sir.”</P>
<P  >“Then
on the strength of what [argument] or with the support of what
[authority] do the brahmins in this case say thus: ‘Brahmins are
the highest caste … heirs of Brahma’?”</P>
<P  >7.
“Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus:

Suppose a noble were to kill living beings, take what is not given,

<P  >“What

offering, or at a sacrificial feast, or at a feast for guests?”</P>

“First, Assalayana, you took your stand on birth, and after that
you took your stand on scriptural learning, and after that you have

all four castes, as I describe it.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana sat silent and
dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and without

<P  >18.
“Once, Assalayana, when seven brahmin seers were dwelling in leaf
huts in the forest, this pernicious view arose in them: ‘Brahmins
are the highest caste … [155] … heirs of Brahma.’ Now the seer
Devala the Dark heard this.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote874anc" HREF="#sdendnote874sym"><SUP>dccclxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Then he arranged his hair and beard, dressed in ochre-coloured
garments, put on stout sandals, and taking a staff made of gold, he
appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers. Then, while
walking up and down the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers, the
seer Devala the Dark spoke thus: ‘Where have those worthy Brahmin
seers gone? Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone?’ Then the
seven brahmin seers thought: ‘Who is walking up and down in the
courtyard of the seven brahmin seers like a village lout speaking
thus: “Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone? Where have those
worthy brahmin seers gone?” Let us curse him!’ Then the seven
brahmin seers cursed the seer Devala the Dark thus: ‘Be ashes, vile
one! Be ashes, vile one!’ But the more the seven brahmin seers
cursed him, the more comely, beautiful, and handsome the seer Devala
the Dark became. Then the seven brahmin seers thought: ‘Our
asceticism is in vain, our holy life is fruitless; for formerly when
we cursed anyone thus: “Be ashes, vile one! Be ashes, vile one!”
he always became ashes; but the more we curse this one, the more
comely, beautiful, and handsome he becomes.’</P>
<P  >“‘Your
asceticism is not in vain, sirs, your holy life is not fruitless.
But, sirs, put away your hatred towards me.’ [156]</P>
<P  >“‘We
have put away our hatred towards you, sir. Who are you?’</P>
<P  >“‘Have
you heard of the seer Devala the Dark, sirs?’ - ‘Yes, sir.’ -’I
am he, sirs.’</P>
<P  >“Then
the seven brahmin seers went to the seer Devala the Dark and paid
homage to him. Then he said to them: ‘Sirs, I heard that while the
seven brahmin seers were dwelling in leaf huts in the forest, this
pernicious view arose in them: “Brahmins are the highest caste …
heirs of Brahma.’“-’That is so, sir.’</P>
<P  >But,
sirs, do you know if the mother who bore you went only with a brahmin
and never with a non-brahmin?’ -’No, sir.’</P>
<P  >“‘But,

generation went only with brahmins and never with non-brahmin?’
-’No, sir.’</P>

about?’</P>
<P  >“‘Sir,
we know how the conception of an embryo in a womb comes about. [157]
Here, there is a union of the mother and father, and it is the
mother’s season, and the being to be reborn is present. Thus the

<P  >“Now,
Assalayana, even those seven brahmin seers, on being pressed and
questioned and cross-questioned by the seer Devala the Dark on their
own assertion about birth, were unable to support it. But how shall
you, on being pressed and questioned and cross-questioned by me now
on your assertion about birth, be able to support it? You, who rely
on the teachers’ doctrines, are not [even fit to be] their
spoon-holder Punna.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote876anc" HREF="#sdendnote876sym"><SUP>dccclxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >19.
When this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana said to the
Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master
Gotama! … (as Sutta 91, §37) … From today let Master Gotama
remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for
life.”</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading95"  >
94. Ghotamukha Sutta - To Ghotamukha</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Udena was living at
Benares in the Khemiya Mango Grove.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Ghotamukha had arrived in Benares
for some business or other. As he was [158] walking and wandering for
exercise, he came to the Khemiya Mango Grove. At the time the
venerable Udena was walking up and down in the open. Then the brahmin
Ghotamukha went up to the venerable Udena and exchanged greetings
with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, still
walking up and down with the venerable Udena, he said this: “Worthy
recluse, there is no wanderers’ life that accords with the Dhamma:
so it seems to me here, and that may be because I have not seen such
venerable ones as yourself or [because I have not seen] the Dhamma
here.”</P>
<P  >3.
When this was said, the venerable Udena stepped down from the walk
and went into his dwelling, where he sat down on a seat made ready.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote877anc" HREF="#sdendnote877sym"><SUP>dccclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
And Ghotamukha too stepped down from the walk and went into the
dwelling, where he stood at one side. Then the venerable Udena said
to him: “There are seats, brahmin, sit down if you wish.”</P>
<P  >“We
did not sit down because we were waiting for Master Udena [to speak].
For how could one like myself presume to sit down on a seat without
first being invited to do so?”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the brahmin Ghotamukha took a low seat, sat down at one side,
and said to the venerable Udena: “Worthy recluse, there is no
wanderers’ life that accords with the Dhamma: so it seems to me
here, and that may be because I have not seen such venerable ones as
yourself or [because I have not seen] the Dhamma here.”</P>
<P  >“Brahmin,
if you think any statement of mine is to be agreed with, then agree
with it; if you think any statement of mine is to be argued against,
then argue against it; and if you do not understand the meaning of
any statement of mine, ask me to clarify it thus: ‘How is this,
Master Udena? What is the meaning of this?’ In this way we can
discuss this matter.”</P>
<P  >“Master
Udena, if I think any statement of Master Udena’s is to be agreed
with, I shall agree with it; if I think any statement of his is to be
argued against, I shall argue against it; and if I [159] do not
understand the meaning of any statement of Master Udena’s, then I
shall ask Master Udena to clarify it thus: ‘How is this Master
Udena? What is the meaning of this?’ In this way let us discuss
this matter.”</P>
<P  >5-6.
“Brahmin, there are four kinds of persons to be found existing in
the world. What four?” … (as Sutta 51, §§5-6) [160] …</P>
<P  >“But,
Master Udena, the kind of person who does not torment himself or
pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not torment
others or pursue the practice of torturing others; who, since he
torments neither himself nor others, is here and now hungerless,
extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing bliss, having
himself become holy - he does not torment and torture either himself
or others, both of whom desire pleasure and recoil from pain. That is
why this kind of person satisfies my mind.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Brahmin, there are two kinds of assembly. What two? Here a certain
assembly lusts after jewels and earrings and seeks wives and
children, men and women slaves, fields and land, gold and silver. But
here a certain assembly does not lust after jewels and earrings, but
having abandoned wives and children, men and women slaves, fields and
land, gold and silver, has gone forth from the home life into
homelessness. Now there is this kind of person who does not torment
himself or pursue the practice of torturing himself and who does not
torment others or pursue the practice of torturing others; who, since
he torments neither himself nor others, is here and now hungerless,
extinguished, and cooled, and abides experiencing bliss, having
himself become holy. In which of the two kinds of assembly do you
usually see this person, brahmin - in the assembly that lusts after
jewels and earrings and seeks wives and children, men and women
slaves, fields and land, gold and silver; or in the assembly that
does not lust after jewels and earrings, but having abandoned wives
and children … has gone forth from the home life into
homelessness?”</P>
<P  >[161]
“I usually see this kind of person, Master Udena, in the assembly
that does not lust after jewels and earrings, but having abandoned
wives and children … has gone forth from the home life into
homelessness.”</P>
<P  >8.
“But only just now, brahmin, we understood you to say: ‘Worthy
recluse, there is no wanderers’ life that accords with the Dhamma:
so it seems to me here, and that may be because I have not seen such
venerable ones as yourself or [because I have not seen] the Dhamma
here.’“</P>
<P  >“Certainly,
Master Udena, it was in order to learn that I spoke those words.
There is a wanderers’ life that accords with the Dhamma; so it
seems to me here, and may Master Udena remember me [to have spoken]
thus. It would be good if, out of compassion, Master Udena would
expound to me in detail those four kinds of persons he mentioned in
brief.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Then, brahmin, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” -
“Yes, sir,” the brahmin Ghotamukha replied. The venerable Udena
said this:</P>
<P  >10-30.
“Brahmin, what kind of person torments himself and pursues the
practice of torturing himself? Here a certain person goes naked …
(as Sutta 51, §§8-28) [162] … and abides experiencing bliss,
having himself become holy.”</P>
<P  >31.
When this was said, the brahmin Ghotamukha said to the venerable
Udena: “Magnificent, Master Udena! Magnificent, Master Udena!
Master Udena has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he
were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was
hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in
the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Udena
for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From
today let Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has gone to
him for refuge for life.”</P>
<P  >32.
“Do not go to me for refuge, brahmin. Go for refuge to that same
Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge.”</P>
<P  >“Where
is he living now, that Master Gotama, accomplished and fully
enlightened, Master Udena?”</P>
<P  >“That
Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, has attained final
Nibbana, brahmin.”</P>
<P  >“If
we heard that Master Gotama was within ten leagues, we would go ten
leagues in order to see that Master Gotama, accomplished and fully
enlightened. If we heard that Master Gotama was within twenty leagues
… thirty leagues … forty leagues … fifty leagues … a hundred
leagues, [163] we would go a hundred leagues in order to see that
Master Gotama, accomplished and fully enlightened. But since that
Master Gotama has attained to final Nibbana, we go to that Master
Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus.
From today let Master Udena remember me as a lay follower who has
gone for refuge for life.</P>
<P  >33.
“Now, Master Udena, the king of Anga gives me a daily donation. Let
me give Master Udena a regular donation from that.”</P>
<P  >“What
kind of regular donation does the king of Anga give you, brahmin?”</P>
<P  >“Five
hundred kahapanas, Master Udena.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote878anc" HREF="#sdendnote878sym"><SUP>dccclxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“It
is not allowable for us to accept gold and silver, brahmin.” “If
it is not allowable for Master Udena, I will have a monastery built
for Master Udena.”</P>
<P  >“If
you desire to have a monastery built for me, brahmin, have an
assembly hall built for the Sangha at Pataliputta.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote879anc" HREF="#sdendnote879sym"><SUP>dccclxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“I
am still more satisfied and pleased that Master Udena suggests that I
give a gift to the Sangha. So with this regular donation and another
regular donation, I shall have an assembly hall built for the Sangha
at Pataliputta.”</P>
<P  >Then
with that regular donation [which he offered to Master Udena] and
another regular donation [added to it], the brahmin Ghotamukha had an
assembly hall built for the Sangha at Pataliputta. And that is now
known as the Ghotamukhi.</P>

95. Canki Sutta - With Canki</H2>
<P  >[164]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote880anc" HREF="#sdendnote880sym"><SUP>dccclxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country
with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually he arrived at a
Kosalan brahmin village named Opasada. There the Blessed One stayed
in the Gods’ Grove,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote881anc" HREF="#sdendnote881sym"><SUP>dccclxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
the Sala-tree Grove to the north of Opasada.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Canki was ruling over Opasada, a
crown property abounding in living beings, rich in grasslands,
woodlands, waterways, and grain, a royal endowment, a sacred grant
given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala.</P>
<P  >3.
The brahmin householders of Opasada heard: “The recluse Gotama …
(as Sutta 91, §3) … Now it is good see such arahants.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the brahmin householders of Opasada set forth from Opasada in
groups and bands and headed northwards to the Gods’ Grove, the
Sala-tree Grove.</P>
<P  >5.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Canki had retired to the upper
storey of his palace for his midday rest. Then he saw the brahmin
householders of Opasada setting forth from Opasada in groups and
bands and heading northwards to the Gods’ Grove, the Sala-tree
Grove. When he saw them, he asked his minister: “Good minister, why
are the brahmin householders of Opasada setting forth from Opasada in
groups and bands and heading northwards to the Gods’ Grove, the
Sala-tree Grove?”</P>
<P  >6.
“Sir, there is the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went
forth from a Sakyan clan, who has been wandering in the Kosalan
country … (as Sutta 91, §3) … They are going to see that Master
Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
good minister, go to the brahmin householders of Opasada and tell
them: ‘Sirs, the brahmin Canki says this: “Please wait, sirs. The
brahmin Canki will also go to see the recluse Gotama.””</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir,” the minister replied, [165] and he went to the brahmin
householders of Opasada and gave them the message.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion five hundred brahmins from various states were
staying at Opasada for some business or other. They heard: “The
brahmin Cankl., it is said, is going to see the recluse Gotama.”
Then they went to the brahmin Canki and asked him: “Sir, is it true
that you are going to see the recluse Gotama?”</P>
<P  >“So
it is, sirs. I am going to see the recluse Gotama.”</P>
<P  >8.
“Sir, do not go to see the recluse Gotama. It is not proper, Master
Canki, for you to go to see the recluse Gotama; rather, it is proper
for the recluse Gotama to come to see you. For you, sir, are well
born on both sides, of pure maternal and paternal descent seven
generations back, unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth.
Since that is so, Master Canki, it is not proper for you to go to see
the recluse Gotama; rather, it is proper for the recluse Gotama to
come to see you. You, sir, are rich, with great wealth and great
possessions. You, sir, are a master of the Three Vedas with their
vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as
a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, you are fully versed in
natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. You, sir, are
handsome, comely, and graceful, possessing supreme beauty of
complexion, with sublime beauty and sublime presence, remarkable to
behold. You, sir, are virtuous, mature in virtue, possessing mature
virtue. You, sir, are a good speaker with a good delivery; [166] you
speak words that are courteous, distinct, flawless, and communicate
the meaning. You, sir, teach the teachers of many, and you teach the
recitation of the hymns to three hundred brahmin students. You, sir,
are honoured, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King
Pasenadi of Kosala. You, sir, are honoured, respected, revered,
venerated, and esteemed by the brahmin Pokkharasati.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote882anc" HREF="#sdendnote882sym"><SUP>dccclxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
You, sir, rule over Opasada, a crown property abounding in living
beings … a sacred grant given to you by King Pasenadi of Kosala.
Since this is so, Master Canki, it is not proper for you to go to see
the recluse Gotama; rather, it is proper for the recluse Gotama to
come to see you.”</P>
<P  >9.
When this was said, the brahmin Canki told those Brahmins: “Now,
sirs, hear from me why it is proper for me to go to see Master
Gotama, and why it is not proper for Master Gotama to come to see me.
Sirs, the recluse Gotama is well born on both sides, of pure maternal
and paternal descent seven generations back, unassailable and
impeccable in respect of birth. Since this is so, sirs, it is not
proper for Master Gotama to come to see me; rather, it is proper for
me to go to see Master Gotama. Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth
abandoning much gold and bullion stored away in vaults and
depositories. Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth from the home life
into homelessness while still young, a black-haired young man endowed
with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life. Sirs, the recluse
Gotama shaved off his hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and
went forth from the home life into homelessness though his mother and
father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces. Sirs, the
recluse Gotama is handsome, comely, and graceful, possessing supreme
beauty of complexion, [167] with sublime beauty and sublime presence,
remarkable to behold. Sirs, the recluse Gotama is virtuous, with
noble virtue, with wholesome virtue, possessing wholesome virtue.
Sirs, the recluse Gotama is a good speaker with a good delivery; he
speaks words that are courteous, distinct, flawless, and communicate
the meaning. Sirs, the recluse Gotama is a teacher of the teachers of
many. Sirs, the recluse Gotama is free from sensual lust and without
personal vanity. Sirs, the recluse Gotama holds the doctrine of the
moral efficacy of action, the doctrine of the moral efficacy of
deeds; he does not seek any harm for the line of brahmins. Sirs, the
recluse Gotama went forth from an aristocratic family, from one of
the original noble families. Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth from
a rich family, from a family of great wealth and great possessions.
Sirs, people come from remote kingdoms and remote districts to
question the recluse Gotama. Sirs, many thousands of deities have
gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama. Sirs, a good report
of the recluse Gotama has been spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed
One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’ Sirs,
the recluse Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks of a Great Man.
Sirs, King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha and his wife and children have
gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama. Sirs, King Pasenadi
of Kosala and his wife and children have gone for refuge for life to
the recluse Gotama. Sirs, the brahmin Pokkharasati and his wife and
children have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama. Sirs,
the recluse Gotama has arrived at Opasada and is living at Opasada in
the Gods’ Grove, the Sala-tree Grove to the north of Opasada. Now
any recluses or brahmins that come to our town are our guests, and
guests should be honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by us.
Since the recluse Gotama has arrived at Opasada, he is our guest, and
as our guest should be honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by
us. [168] Since this is so, sirs, it is not proper for Master Gotama
to come to see me; rather, it is proper for me to go to see Master
Gotama.</P>
<P  >“Sirs,
this much is the praise of Master Gotama that I have learned, but the
praise of Master Gotama is not limited to that, for the praise of
Master Gotama is immeasurable. Since Master Gotama possesses each one
of these factors, it is not proper for him to come to see me; rather,
it is proper for me to go to see Master Gotama. Therefore, sirs, let
all of us go to see the recluse Gotama.”</P>
<P  >10.
Then the brahmin Canki, together with a large company of brahmins,
went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this
courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side.</P>
<P  >11.
Now on that occasion the Blessed One was seated finishing some
amiable talk with some very senior brahmins. At the time, sitting in
the assembly, was a brahmin student named Kapathika. Young,
shaven-headed, sixteen years old, he was a master of the Three Vedas
with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the
histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he was fully
versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. While
the very senior brahmins were conversing with the Blessed One, he
often broke in and interrupted their talk. Then the Blessed One
rebuked the brahmin student Kapathika thus: “Let not the venerable
Bharadvaja break in and interrupt the talk of the very senior
brahmins while they are conversing. Let the venerable Bharadvaja wait
until the talk is finished.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin Canki said to the Blessed One: “Let not
Master Gotama rebuke the brahmin student Kapathika. The brahmin
student Kapathika is a clansman, he is very learned, he has a good
delivery, he is wise; he is capable of taking part in this discussion
with Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >12.
Then the Blessed One thought: “Surely, [169] since the brahmins
honour him thus, the brahmin student Kapathika must be accomplished
in the scriptures of the Three Vedas.”</P>
<P  >Then
the brahmin student Kapathika thought: “When the recluse Gotama
catches my eye, I shall ask him a question.”</P>
<P  >Then,
knowing with his own mind the thought in the brahmin student
Kapathika’s mind, the Blessed One turned his eye towards him. Then
the brahmin student Kapathika thought: “The recluse Gotama has
turned towards me. Suppose I ask him a question.” Then he said to
the Blessed One: “Master Gotama, in regard to the ancient brahmanic
hymns that have come down through oral transmission and in the
scriptural collections, the brahmins come to the definite conclusion:
‘Only this is true, anything else is wrong.’ What does Master
Gotama say about this?”</P>
<P  >13.
“How then, Bharadvaja, among the brahmins is there even a single
brahmin who says thus: ‘I know this, I see this: only this is true,
anything else is wrong’?” - “No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“How
then, Bharadvaja, among the brahmins is there even a single teacher
or a single teacher’s teacher back to the seventh generation of
teachers who says thus: I know this, I see this: only this is true,
anything else is wrong’?” - “No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“How
then, Bharadvaja, the ancient brahmin seers, the creators of the
hymns, the composers of the hymns, whose ancient hymns that were
formerly chanted, uttered, and compiled, the brahmins nowadays still
chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken and reciting what was
recited - that is, Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi,
Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote883anc" HREF="#sdendnote883sym"><SUP>dccclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
- did even these ancient brahmin. seers say thus: ‘We know this, we
see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong’?” - [170]
“No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“So,
Bharadvaja, it seems that among the brahmins there is not even a
single brahmin who says thus: ‘I know this, I see this: only this
is true, anything else is wrong.’ And among the brahmins there is
not even a single teacher or a single teacher’s teacher back to the
seventh generation of teachers, who says thus: ‘I know this, I see
this: only this is true, anything else is wrong.’ And the ancient
brahmin seers, the creators of the hymns, the composers of the hymns
… even these ancient brahmin seers did not say thus: ‘We know
this, we see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong.’
Suppose there were a file of blind men each in touch with the next:
the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last
one does not see. So too, Bharadvaja, in regard to their statement
the brahmins seem to be like a file of blind men: the first one does
not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.
What do you think, Bharadvaja, that being so, does not the faith of
the brahmins turn out to be groundless?”</P>
<P  >14.
“The brahmins honour this not only out of faith, Master Gotama.
They also honour it as oral tradition.”</P>
<P  >“Bharadvaja,
first you took your stand on faith, now you speak of oral tradition.
There are five things, Bharadvaja, that may turn out in two different
ways here and now. What five? Faith, approval, oral tradition,
reasoned cogitation, and reflective acceptance of a view.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote884anc" HREF="#sdendnote884sym"><SUP>dccclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
These five things may turn out in two different ways here and now.
Now something may be fully accepted out of faith, yet it may be
empty, hollow, and false; but something else may not be fully
accepted out of faith, yet it may be factual, true, and unmistaken.
Again, [171] something may be fully approved of … may be well
cogitated … may be well reflected upon, yet it may be empty,
hollow, and false; but something else may not be well reflected upon,
yet it may be factual, true, and unmistaken. [Under these conditions]
it is not proper for a wise man who preserves truth to come to the
definite conclusion: ‘Only this is true, anything else is wrong.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote885anc" HREF="#sdendnote885sym"><SUP>dccclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
“But, Master Gotama, in what way is there the preservation of
truth?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote886anc" HREF="#sdendnote886sym"><SUP>dccclxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
How does one preserve truth? We ask Master Gotama about the
preservation of truth.”</P>
<P  >“If
a person has faith, Bharadvaja, he preserves truth when he says: ‘My
faith is thus’; but he does not yet come to the definite
conclusion: ‘Only this is true, anything else is wrong.’ In this
way, Bharadvaja, there is the preservation of truth; in this way he
preserves truth; in this way we describe the preservation of truth.
But as yet there is no discovery of truth.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote887anc" HREF="#sdendnote887sym"><SUP>dccclxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“If
a person approves of something … if he receives an oral tradition …
if he [reaches a conclusion based on] reasoned cogitation. . .if he
gains a reflective acceptance of a view, he preserves truth when he
says: ‘My reflective acceptance of a view is thus’; but he does
not yet come to the definite conclusion: ‘Only this is true,
anything else is wrong.’ In this way too, Bharadvaja, there is the
preservation of truth; in this way he preserves truth; in this way we
describe the preservation of truth. But as yet there is no discovery
of truth.”</P>
<P  >16.
“In that way, Master Gotama, there is the preservation of truth; in
that way one preserves truth; in that way we recognise the
preservation of truth. But in what way, Master Gotama, is there the
discovery of truth? In what way does one discover truth? We ask
Master Gotama about the discovery of truth.”</P>
<P  >17.
“Here, Bharadvaja, a bhikkhu may be living in dependence on some
village or town.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote888anc" HREF="#sdendnote888sym"><SUP>dccclxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then a householder or a householder’s son goes to him and
investigates him in regard to three kinds of states: [172] in regard
to states based on greed, in regard to states based on hate, and in
regard to states based on delusion: ‘Are there in this venerable
one any states based on greed such that, with his mind obsessed by
those states, while not knowing he might say, “I know,” or while
not seeing he might say, “I see,” or he might urge others to act
in a way that would lead to their harm and suffering for a long
time?’ As he investigates him he comes to know: ‘There are no
such states based on greed in this venerable one. The bodily
behaviour and the verbal behaviour of this venerable one are not
those of one affected by greed. And the Dhamma that this venerable
one teaches is profound, hard to see and hard to understand, peaceful
and sublime, unattainable by mere reasoning, subtle, to be
experienced by the wise. This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one
affected by greed.’</P>
<P  >18.
“When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from
states based on greed, he next investigates him in regard to states
based on hate: ‘Are there in this venerable one any states based on
hate such that, with his mind obsessed by those states … he might
urge others to act in a way that would lead to their harm and
suffering for a long time?’ As he investigates him, he comes to
know: ‘There are no such states based on hate in this venerable
one. The bodily behaviour and the verbal behaviour of this venerable
one are not those of one affected by hate. And the Dhamma that this
venerable one teaches is profound.. .to be experienced by the wise.
This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one affected by hate.’</P>
<P  >19.
“When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from
states based on hate, [173] he next investigates him in regard to
states based on delusion: ‘Are there in this venerable one any
states based on delusion such that, with his mind obsessed by those
states … h.e might urge others to act in a way that would lead to
their harm and suffering for a long time?’ As he investigates him,
he comes to know: ‘There are no such states based on delusion in
this venerable one. The bodily behaviour and the verbal behaviour of
this venerable one are not those of one affected by delusion. And the
Dhamma that this venerable one teaches is profound … to be
experienced by the wise. This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one
affected by delusion.’</P>
<P  >20.
“When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from
states based on delusion, then he places faith in him; filled with
faith he visits him and pays respect to him; having paid respect to
him, he gives ear; when he gives ear, he hears the Dhamma; having
heard the Dhamma, he memorises it and examines the meaning of the
teachings he has memorised; when he examines their meaning, he gains
a reflective acceptance of those teachings; when he has gained a

“In that way, Master Gotama, there is the discovery of truth; in

Gotama about the final arrival at truth.” [174]</P>
<P  >“The
final arrival at truth, Bharadvaja, lies in the repetition,

most helpful for the final arrival at truth.”</P>
<P  >“Striving
is most helpful for the final arrival at truth, Bharadvaja. If one

<P  >26.
“But what, Master Gotama, is most helpful for zeal? [175] We ask
Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for zeal.”</P>
<P  >“A

Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for giving ear.”</P>
<P  >“Paying

“But what, Master Gotama, is most helpful for paying respect? We
ask Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for paying respect.”</P>
<P  >“Visiting
is most helpful for paying respect, Bharadvaja. If one does not visit
[a teacher], one will not pay respect to him; but because one visits
[a teacher], one pays respect to him. That is why visiting is most
helpful for paying respect.”</P>
<P  >33.
“But what, Master Gotama, is most helpful for visiting? We ask
Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for visiting.”</P>

“We asked Master Gotama about the preservation of truth, and Master
Gotama answered about the preservation of truth; we approve of and

We asked Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for the final

about, that he has answered us; we approve of and accept that answer,

96. Esukari Sutta - To Esukari</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the brahmin Esukari went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said:</P>
<P  >3.
“Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four levels of service. They
prescribe the level of service towards a brahmin, the level of
service towards a noble, the level of service towards a merchant, and
the level of service towards a worker. Therein, Master Gotama, the
brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a brahmin: a
brahmin may serve a brahmin, a noble may serve a brahmin, a merchant
may serve a brahmin, and a worker may serve a brahmin. That is the
level of service towards a brahmin [178] that the brahmins prescribe.
Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe this as the level of service
towards a noble: a noble may serve a noble, a merchant may serve a
noble, and a worker may serve a noble. That is the level of service
towards a noble that the brahmins prescribe. Master Gotama, the
brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a merchant: a
merchant may serve a merchant and a worker may serve a merchant. That
is the level of service towards a merchant that the brahmins
prescribe. Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe this as the level of
service towards a worker: only a worker may serve a worker; for who
else could serve a worker? That is the level of service towards a
worker that the brahmins prescribe. What does Master Gotama say about
this?”</P>
<P  >4.
“Well, brahmin, has all the world authorised the brahmins to
prescribe these four levels of service?” - “No, Master Gotama.”
- “Suppose, brahmin, they were to force a cut of meat upon a poor,
penniless, destitute man and tell him: ‘Good man, you must eat this
meat and pay for it’; so too, without the consent of those [other]
recluses and brahmins, the brahmins nevertheless prescribe those four
levels of service.</P>
<P  >5.
“I do not say, brahmin, that all are to be served, nor do I say
that none are to be served. For if, when serving someone, one becomes
worse and not better because of that service, then I say that he
should not be served. And if, when serving someone, one becomes
better and not worse because of that service, then I say that he
should be served.</P>
<P  >6.
“If they were to ask a noble thus: ‘Which of these should you
serve - one in whose service you become worse and not better when
serving him, or one in whose service you become better and not worse
when serving him: [179] answering rightly, a noble would answer thus:
‘I should not serve the one in whose service I become worse and not
better when serving him; I should serve the one in whose service I
become better and not worse when serving him.’</P>
<P  >“If
they were to ask a brahmin … to ask a merchant … to ask a worker
… answering rightly, a worker would answer thus: ‘I should not
serve the one in whose service I become worse and not better when
serving him; I should serve the one in whose service I become better
and not worse when serving him.’</P>
<P  >7.
“I do not say, brahmin, that one is better because one is from an
aristocratic family, nor do I say that one is worse because one is
from an aristocratic family. I do not say that one is better because
one is of great beauty, nor do I say that one is worse because one is
of great beauty. I do not say that one is better because one is of
great wealth, nor do I say that one is worse because one is of great
wealth.</P>
<P  >8.
“For here, brahmin, one from an aristocratic family may kill living
beings, take what is not given, misconduct himself in sensual
pleasures, speak falsely, speak maliciously, speak harshly, gossip,
be covetous, have a mind of ill will, and hold wrong view. Therefore
I do not say that one is better because one is from an aristocratic
family. But also, brahmin, one from an aristocratic family may
abstain from killing living beings, from taking what is not given,
from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from false speech, from
malicious speech, from harsh speech, and from gossip, and he may be
uncovetous, have a mind without ill will, and hold right view.
Therefore I do not say that one is worse because one is from an
aristocratic family.</P>
<P  >“Here,
brahmin, one of great beauty … one of great wealth may kill living
beings … and hold wrong view. Therefore I do not say that one is
better because one is of great beauty … of great wealth. But also,
brahmin, one of great beauty … of great wealth may abstain from
killing living beings … and hold right view. Therefore [180] I do
not say that one is worse because one is of great beauty … of great
wealth.</P>
<P  >9.
“1 do not say, brahmin, that all are to be served, nor do I say
that none are to be served. For if, when serving someone, one’s
faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom increase in his
service, then I say that he should be served.”</P>
<P  >10.
When this was said, the brahmin Esukari said to the Blessed One:
“Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four types of wealth. They
prescribe the wealth of a brahmin, the wealth of a noble, the wealth
of a merchant, and the wealth of a worker.</P>
<P  >“Therein,
Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a brahmin
- wandering for alms;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote894anc" HREF="#sdendnote894sym"><SUP>dcccxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
a brahmin who spurns his own wealth, wandering for alms, abuses his
duty like a guard who takes what has not been given. That is the
wealth of a brahmin which the brahmins prescribe. Master Gotama, the
brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a noble - the bow and
quiver; a noble who spurns his own wealth, the bow and quiver, abuses
his duty like a guard who takes what has not been given. That is the
wealth of a noble which the brahmins prescribe. Master Gotama, the
brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a merchant - farming and
cattle-breeding;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote895anc" HREF="#sdendnote895sym"><SUP>dcccxcv</SUP></A></SUP>
a merchant who spurns his own wealth, farming and cattle-breeding,
abuses his duty like a guard who takes what has not been given. That
is the wealth of a merchant which the brahmins prescribe. Master
Gotama, the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a worker - the
sickle and carrying-pole; a worker who spurns his own wealth, the
sickle and carrying-pole, abuses his duty like a guard who takes what
has not been given. That is the wealth of a worker which the brahmins
prescribe. What does Master Gotama say about this?”</P>
<P  >11.
“Well, brahmin, has all the world authorised the brahmins to
prescribe these four types of wealth?” - [181] “No, Master
Gotama.” - “Suppose, brahmin, they were to force a cut of meat</P>
<P  >upon
a poor, penniless, destitute man and tell him: ‘Good man, you must
eat this meat and pay for it’; so too, without the consent of those
[other] recluses and brahmins, the brahmins nevertheless prescribe
these four types of wealth.</P>
<P  >12.
“I, brahmin, declare the noble supramundane Dhamma as a person’s
own wealth.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote896anc" HREF="#sdendnote896sym"><SUP>dcccxcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
But recollecting his ancient maternal and paternal family lineage, he
is reckoned according to wherever he is reborn.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote897anc" HREF="#sdendnote897sym"><SUP>dcccxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
If he is reborn in a clan of nobles, he is reckoned as a noble; if he
is reborn in a clan of brahmins, he is reckoned as a brahmin; if he
is reborn in a clan of merchants, he is reckoned as a merchant; if he
is reborn in a clan of workers, he is reckoned as a worker. Just as
fire is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it
burns - when fire burns dependent on logs, it is reckoned as a log
fire; when fire burns dependent on faggots, it is reckoned as a
faggot fire; when fire burns dependent on grass, it is reckoned as a
grass fire; when fire burns dependent on cowdung, it is reckoned as a
cowdung fire - so too, brahmin, I declare the noble supramundane
Dhamma as a person’s own wealth. But recollecting his ancient
maternal and paternal lineage, he is reckoned according to wherever
he is reborn. If he is reborn … in a clan of workers, he is
reckoned as a worker.</P>
<P  >13.
“If, brahmin, anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth from the home
life into homelessness, and after encountering the Dhamma and
Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata, he abstains from killing
living beings, from taking what is not given, from incelibacy, from
false speech, from malicious speech, from harsh speech, and from
gossip, and is uncovetous, has a mind without ill will, and holds
right view, he is one who is accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma

he abstains from killing living beings … and holds right view, he

<P  >14.
“What do you think, brahmin? Is only a brahmin capable of
developing a mind of loving-kindness towards a certain region,
without hostility and without ill will, and not a noble, or a
merchant, or a worker?”</P>
<P  >“No,
Master Gotama. Whether it be a noble, or a brahmin, or a merchant, or
a worker - those of all four castes are capable of developing a mind
of loving-kindness towards a certain region, without hostility and
without ill will.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, brahmin, if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth … (repeat
§13) … he is one who is accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma
that is wholesome.</P>
<P  >15.
“What do you think, brahmin? Is only a brahmin capable of taking a

<P  >“No,

97. Dhananjani Sutta - To Dhananjani</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was wandering in the
Southern Hills with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. Then a certain [185]
bhikkhu who had spent the Rains at Rajagaha went to the venerable
Sariputta in the Southern Hills and exchanged greetings with him.
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and the venerable Sariputta asked him: “Is the Blessed One
well and strong, friend?”</P>
<P  >“The
Blessed One is well and strong, friend.”</P>
<P  >“Is
the Sangha of bhikkhus well and strong, friend?”</P>
<P  >“The
Sangha of bhikkhus too is well and strong, friend.”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
there is a brahmin named Dhananjani living in Rajagaha at the
Tandulapala Gate. Is that brahmin Dhananjani well and strong?”</P>
<P  >“That
brahmin Dhananjani too is well and strong, friend.”</P>
<P  >“Is
he diligent, friend?”</P>
<P  >“How
could he be diligent, friend? He plunders brahmin householders in the
name of the king, and he plunders the king in the name of the brahmin
householders. His wife, who had faith and came from a clan with
faith, has died and he has taken another wife, a woman without faith
who comes from a clan without faith.”</P>
<P  >“This
is bad news that we hear, friend. It is bad news indeed to hear that
the brahmin Dhananjani has become negligent. Perhaps sometime or
other we might meet the brahmin Dhananjani and have some conversation
with him.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then, having stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he chose, the
venerable Sariputta set out to wander towards</P>
<P  >Rajagaha.
Wandering by stages he eventually arrived at Rajagaha, and there he
lived in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >4.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Sariputta dressed, and
taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Rajagaha for alms. [186]
Now at that time the brahmin Dhananjani was having his cows milked in
a cowshed outside the city. So when the venerable Sariputta had
wandered for alms in Rajagaha and had returned from his almsround,
after his meal he went to the brahmin Dhananjani. The brahmin
Dhananjani saw the venerable Sariputta coming in the distance, and he
went to him and said: “Drink some of this fresh milk, Master
Sariputta, until it is time for the meal.”</P>
<P  >“Enough,
brahmin, I have finished my meal for today. I shall be at the root of
that tree for the day’s abiding. You may come there.” “Yes,
sir,” he replied.</P>
<P  >5.
And then, after he had eaten his morning meal, the brahmin Dhananjani
went to the venerable Sariputta and exchanged greetings with him.
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and the venerable Sariputta asked him: “Are you diligent,
Dhananjani?”</P>
<P  >“How
can we be diligent, Master Sariputta, when we have to support our
parents, our wife and children, and our slaves, servants, and
workers; when we have to do our duty towards our friends and
companions, towards our kinsmen and relatives, towards our guests,
towards our departed ancestors, towards the deities, and towards the
king; and when this body must also be refreshed and nourished?”</P>
<P  >6.
“What do you think, Dhananjani? Suppose someone here were to behave
contrary to the Dhamma, to behave unrighteously for the sake of his
parents, and then because of such behaviour the wardens of hell were
to drag him off to hell. Would he be able [to free himself by
pleading thus]: ‘It was for the sake of my parents that I behaved
contrary to the Dhamma, that I behaved unrighteously, so let not the
wardens of hell [drag me off] to hell’? [187] Or would his parents
be able [to free him by pleading thus]: ‘It was for our sake that
he behaved contrary to the Dhamma, that he behaved unrighteously, so
let not the wardens of hell [drag him off] to hell’?”</P>
<P  >“No,
Master Sariputta. Even while he was crying out, the wardens of hell
would fling him into hell.”</P>
<P  >7-15.
“What do you think, Dhananjani? Suppose someone here were to behave
contrary to the Dhamma, to behave unrighteously for the sake of his
wife and children … for the sake of his slaves, servants, and
workers … for the sake of his friends and companions … for the
sake of his kinsmen and relatives … for the sake of his guests …
[188] for the sake of his departed ancestors.. .for the sake of the
deities … for the sake of the king … for the sake of refreshing
and nourishing this body, and because of such. behaviour the wardens
of hell were to drag him off to hell. Would he be able [to free
himself by pleading thus]: ‘It was for the sake of refreshing and
nourishing this body that I behaved contrary to the Dhamma, that I
behaved unrighteously, so let not the wardens of hell [drag me off]
to hell’? Or would others be able [to free him by pleading thus]:
‘It was for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body that he
behaved contrary to the Dhamma, that he behaved unrighteously, so let
not the wardens of hell [drag him off] to hell’?”</P>
<P  >“No,
Master Sariputta. Even while he was crying out, the wardens of hell
would fling him into hell.”</P>
<P  >16.
“What do you think, Dhananjani? Who is the better, one who for the
sake of his parents behaves contrary to the Dhamma, behaves
unrighteously, or one who for the sake of his parents behaves
according to the Dhamma, behaves righteously?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Sariputta, the one who for the sake of his parents behaves contrary
to the Dhamma, behaves unrighteously, is not the better; the one who
for the sake of his parents behaves according to the Dhamma, behaves
righteously, is the better.”</P>
<P  >“Dhananjani,
there are other kinds of work, profitable and in accordance with the
Dhamma, by means of which one can support one’s parents and at the
same time both avoid doing evil and practise merit.</P>
<P  >17-25.
“What do you think, Dhananjani? Who is the better, one who for the
sake of his wife and children … [189] … for the sake of his
slaves, servants, and workers … for the sake of his friends and
companions … [190] … for the sake of his kinsmen and relatives …
for the sake of his guests … for the sake of his departed ancestors
… for the sake of the deities … [191] … for the sake of the
king … for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this body behaves
contrary to the Dhamma, behaves unrighteously, or one who for the
sake of refreshing and nourishing this body behaves according to the
Dhamma, behaves righteously?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Sariputta, the one who for the sake of refreshing and nourishing this
body behaves contrary to the Dhamma, behaves unrighteously, is not
the better; the one who for the sake of refreshing and nourishing
this body behaves according to the Dhamma, behaves righteously, is
the better.”</P>
<P  >“Dhananjani,
there are other kinds of work, profitable and in accordance with the
Dhamma, by means of which one can refresh and nourish this body and
at the same time both avoid doing evil and practise merit.”</P>
<P  >26.
Then the brahmin Dhananjani, having delighted and rejoiced in the
venerable Sariputta’s words, rose from his seat and departed.</P>
<P  >27.
On a later occasion the brahmin Dhananjani became afflicted,
suffering, and gravely ill. Then he told a man: “Come, good man,
[192] go to the Blessed One, pay homage in my name with your head at
his feet, and say: ‘Venerable sir, the brahmin Dhananjani is
afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill; he pays homage with his head
at the Blessed One’s feet.’ Then go to the venerable Sariputta,
pay homage in my name with your head at his feet, and say: ‘Venerable
sir, the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill;
he pays homage with his head at the venerable Sariputta’s feet.’
Then say thus: ‘It would be good, venerable sir, if the venerable
Sariputta would come to the house of the brahmin Dhananjani, out of
compassion.’“</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” the man replied, and he went to the Blessed One,
and after paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side
and delivered his message. Then he went to the venerable Sariputta
and after paying homage to the venerable Sariputta, he delivered his
message, saying: “It would be good, venerable sir, if the venerable
Sariputta would come to the residence of the brahmin Dhananjani, out
of compassion.” The venerable Sariputta consented in silence.</P>
<P  >28.
Then the venerable Sariputta dressed, and taking his bowl and outer
robe, he went to the residence of the brahmin Dhananjani, sat down on
a seat made ready, and said to the brahmin Dhananjani: “I hope you
are getting well, brahmin, I hope you are comfortable. I hope your
painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that their
subsiding, not their increase, is apparent.”</P>
<P  >29.
“Master Sariputta, I am not getting well, I am not comfortable. My
painful feelings are increasing, not subsiding; their increase and
not their subsiding is apparent. Just as if [193] a strong man were
splitting my head open with a sharp sword, so too, violent winds cut
through my head. I am not getting well … Just as if a strong man
were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband,
so too, there are violent pains in my head. I am not getting well …
Just as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an
ox’s belly with a sharp butcher’s knife, so too, violent winds
are carving up my belly. I am not getting well … Just as if two
strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over
a pit of hot coals, so too, there is a violent burning in my body. I
am not getting well, I am not comfortable. My painful feelings are
increasing, not subsiding; their increase and not their subsiding is
apparent.”</P>
<P  >30.
“What do you think, Dhananjani? Which is better - hell or the
animal realm?” - “The animal realm, Master Sariputta.” - “Which
is better - the animal realm or the realm of ghosts?” - “The
realm of ghosts, Master Sariputta.” - “Which is better - the
realm of ghosts or the realm of human beings?” - “Human beings,
Master Sariputta.” [194] “Which is better - human beings or the
gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings?” - “The gods of the
heaven of the Four Great Kings, Master Sariputta.” - “Which is
better - the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings or the gods
of the heaven of the Thirty-three?” - “The gods of the heaven of
the Thirty-three, Master Sariputta.” - “Which is better - the
gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three or the Yama gods?” - “The
Yama gods, Master Sariputta.” - “Which is better - the Yama gods
or the gods of the Tusita heaven?” - “The gods of the Tusita
heaven, Master Sariputta.” - “Which is better - the gods of the
Tusita heaven or the gods who delight in creating?” - “The gods
who delight in creating, Master Sariputta.” - “Which is better -
the gods who delight in creating or the gods who wield power over
others’ creations?” - “The gods who wield power over others’
creations, Master Sariputta.”</P>
<P  >31.
“What do you think, Dhananjani? Which is better - the gods who
wield power over others’ creations or the Brahmaworld?” - “Master
Sariputta said ‘the Brahma-world.’ Master Sariputta said ‘the
Brahma-world.’“</P>
<P  >Then
the venerable Sariputta thought: “These brahmins are devoted to the
Brahma-world. Suppose I show the brahmin Dhananjani the path to the
company of Brahma?” [And he said:] “Dhananjani, I shall show you
the path to the company of Brahma. Listen and attend closely to what
I shall say.” - “Yes, sir,” he replied. [195] The venerable
Sariputta said this:</P>
<P  >32.
“What is the path to the company of Brahma? Here, Dhananjani, a
bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise
the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to
himself, he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind
imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility and without ill will. This is the path to the company of
Brahma.</P>
<P  >33-35.
“Again, Dhananjani, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a
mind imbued with compassion … with a mind imbued with appreciative
joy … with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second,
likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and
everywhere, and to all as to himself, he abides pervading the
all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with equanimity, abundant,
exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will. This
too is the path to the company of Brahma.”</P>
<P  >36.
“Then, Master Sariputta, pay homage in my name with your head at
the Blessed One’s feet, and say: ‘Venerable sir, the brahmin
Dhananjani is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill; he pays homage
with his head at the Blessed One’s feet.’“</P>
<P  >Then
the venerable Sariputta, having established the brahmin Dhananjani in
the inferior Brahma-world, rose from his seat and departed while
there was still more to be done.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote898anc" HREF="#sdendnote898sym"><SUP>dcccxcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Soon after the venerable Sariputta had left, the brahmin Dhananjani
died and reappeared in the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >37.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus,
Sariputta, having established the brahmin Dhananjani in the inferior
Brahma-world, rose from his seat and departed while there was still
more to be done.”</P>
<P  >38.
Then the venerable Sariputta went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said: “Venerable
sir, the brahmin Dhananjani is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill;
he pays homage with his head at the Blessed One’s feet.”</P>
<P  >“Sariputta,
having established the brahmin Dhananjani [196] in the inferior
Brahma-world, why did you rise from your seat and leave while there
was still more to be done?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, I thought thus: ‘These Brahmins are devoted to the
Brahma-world. Suppose I show the brahmin Dhananjani the path to the

<P  >“Sariputta,

On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Icchanangala, in the
wood near Icchanangala.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a number of well-known, well-to-do brahmins were
staying at Icchanangala, that is, the brahmin Cank3, the brahmin
Tarukkha, the brahmin Pokkharasati, the brahmin Janussoni, the
brahmin Todeyya, and other wellknown, well-to-do brahmins.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, while the brahmin students Vasettha and Bharadvaja were walking
and wandering for exercise, this discussion arose between them: “How
is one a brahmin?” The brahmin student Bharadvaja said: “When one
is well-born on both sides, of pure maternal and paternal descent
seven generations back, unassailable and impeccable in respect of
birth, then one is a brahmin.” The brahmin student Vasettha said:
“When one is virtuous and fulfils the observances, then one is a
brahmin.”</P>
<P  >4.
But the brahmin student Bharadvaja could not [116] convince the
brahmin student Vasettha, nor could the brahmin student Vasettha
convince the brahmin student Bharadvaja.</P>
<P  >5.
Then the brahmin student Vasettha addressed the brahmin student
Bharadvaja: “Sir, the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who
went forth from a Sakyan clan, is living at Icchanangala, in the wood
near Icchanangala. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread
to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’ Come, Bharadvaja, let us go
to the recluse Gotama and ask him about this matter. As he answers,
so we will remember it.” - “Yes, sir,” the brahmin student
Bharadvaja replied.</P>
<P  >6.
Then the two brahmin students, Vasettha and Bharadvaja, went to the
Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, they sat down at one side and the brahmin
student Vasettha addressed the Blessed One in stanzas thus:</P>
<P  >7.
Vasettha</P>
<P >
1. “We are both acknowledged to possess</P>
<P >
The knowledge we claim of the Triple Veda,</P>
<P >
For I am Pokkharasati’s pupil</P>
<P >
And he a pupil of Tarukkha.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
2. We have attained full mastery</P>
<P >
Over all that the Vedic experts teach;</P>
<P >
Skilled in philology and grammar</P>
<P >
We match our teachers in discussion. [117]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
3. A dispute has arisen between us, Gotama,</P>
<P >
Concerning the question of birth and class:</P>
<P >
Bharadvaja says one is a brahmin by birth,</P>
<P >
While I hold one is a brahmin by action.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote901anc" HREF="#sdendnote901sym"><SUP>cmi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
Know this, O Seer, as our debate.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
4. Since neither of us could convince the other,</P>
<P >
Or make him see his point of view,</P>
<P >
We have come to ask you, sir,</P>
<P >
Widely famed to be a Buddha.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
5. As people turn with palms upraised</P>
<P >
Towards the moon when it reaches fullness,</P>
<P >
So in the world do they venerate you</P>
<P >
And pay homage to you, Gotama.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
6. So now we ask of you, Gotama,</P>
<P >
The eye uprisen in the world:</P>
<P >
Is one a brahmin by birth or action?</P>
<P >
Explain to us who do not know</P>
<P >
How we should recognise a brahmin.”</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >8.

7. “I will explain to you as they really are,</P>
<P >

<P >
“The generic divisions of living beings;</P>
<P >

8. Know first the grass and trees:</P>

For many are the kinds of birth.</P>

When this was said, the brahmin students Vasettha and Bharadvaja said
to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent,

followers who have gone to him for refuge for life.”</P>

99. Subha Sutta - To Subha</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, was
staying at the residence of a certain householder in Savatthi for
some business or other.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote908anc" HREF="#sdendnote908sym"><SUP>cmviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, asked the
householder in whose residence he was staying: “Householder, I have
heard that Savatthi is not devoid of arahants. What recluse or
brahmin may we go to today to pay our respects?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, this Blessed One is living at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove,
Anathapindika’s Park. You may go to pay your respects to that
Blessed One, venerable sir.” [197]</P>
<P  >3.
Then, having assented to the householder, the brahmin student Subha,
Todeyya’s son, went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with
him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down
at one side and asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >4.
“Master Gotama, the brahmins say this: ‘The householder is
accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome. The one
gone forth [into homelessness] is not accomplishing the true way, the
Dhamma that is wholesome.’ What does Master Gotama say about this?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
student, I am one who speaks after making an analysis;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote909anc" HREF="#sdendnote909sym"><SUP>cmix</SUP></A></SUP>
I do not speak one-sidedly. I do not praise the wrong way of practice
on the part either of a householder or one gone forth; for whether it
be a householder or one gone forth, one who has entered on the wrong
way of practice, by reason of his wrong way of practice, is not
accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome. I praise
the right way of practice on the part either of a householder or one
gone forth; for whether it be a householder or one gone forth, one
who has entered on the right way of practice, by reason of his right
way of practice, is accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma that is
wholesome.”</P>
<P  >5.
“Master Gotama, the brahmins say this: ‘Since the work of the
household life involves a great deal of activity, great functions,
great engagements, and great undertakings, it is of great fruit.
Since the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of
activity, small functions, small engagements, and small undertakings,
it is of small fruit.’ What does Master Gotama say about this?”</P>
<P  >“Here
too, student, I am one who speaks after making an analysis; I do not
speak one-sidedly. There is work involving a great deal of activity,
great functions, great engagements, and great undertakings, which,
when it fails, is of small fruit. There is work involving a great
deal of activity, great functions, great engagements, and great
undertakings, which, when it succeeds, is of great fruit. There is
work involving a small amount of activity, small functions, small
engagements, and small undertakings, which, when it fails, is of
small fruit. There is work involving a small amount of activity,
small functions, small engagements, and small undertakings, which,
when it succeeds, is of great fruit.</P>
<P  >6.
“What, [198] student, is that work involving a great deal of
activity … which, when it fails, is of small fruit? Agriculture is
that work involving a great deal of activity … which, when it
fails, is of small fruit. And what, student, is that work involving a
great deal of activity … which, when it succeeds, is of great
fruit? Agriculture again is that work involving a great deal of
activity … which, when it succeeds, is of great fruit. And what,
student, is that work involving a small amount of activity … which,
when it fails, is of small fruit? Trade is that work involving a
small amount of activity … which, when it fails, is of small
fruit.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote910anc" HREF="#sdendnote910sym"><SUP>cmx</SUP></A></SUP>
And what, student, is that work involving a small amount of activity
… which, when it succeeds, is of great fruit? Trade again is that
work involving a small amount of activity … which, when it
succeeds, is of great fruit.</P>
<P  >7.
“Just as agriculture, student, is work that involves a great deal
of activity … but is of small fruit when it fails, so the work of
the household life involves a great deal of activity, great
functions, great engagements, and great undertakings, but is of small
fruit when it fails. Just as agriculture is work that involves a
great deal of activity … and is of great fruit when it succeeds, so
the work of the household life involves a great deal of activity,
great functions, great engagements, and great undertakings, and is of
great fruit when it succeeds. Just as trade is work that involves a
small amount of activity … and is of small fruit when it fails, so
the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of activity,
small functions, small engagements, and small undertakings, and is of
small fruit when it fails. Just as trade is work that involves a
small amount of activity … but is of great fruit when it succeeds,
so [199] the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of
activity, small functions, small engagements, and small undertakings,
but is of great fruit when it succeeds.”</P>

“Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe five things for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome.”</P>
<P  >“If
it is not troublesome for you, student, please state to this assembly
the five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of
merit, for accomplishing the wholesome.”</P>
<P  >“It
is not troublesome for me, Master Gotama, when such venerable ones as
yourself and others are sitting [in the assembly].” “Then state
them, student.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Master Gotama, truth is the first thing that the brahmins
prescribe for the performance of merit, for accomplishing the
wholesome. Asceticism is the second thing … Celibacy is the third
thing … Study is the fourth thing … Generosity is the fifth thing
that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit, for
accomplishing the wholesome. These are the five things that the
brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit, for accomplishing
the wholesome. What does Master Gotama say about this?”</P>
<P  >“How
then, student,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote911anc" HREF="#sdendnote911sym"><SUP>cmxi</SUP></A></SUP>
among the brahmins is there even a single brahmin who says thus: ‘I
declare the result of these five things having realised it myself
with direct knowledge’?” - “No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“How
then, student, among the brahmins is there even a single teacher or
teacher’s teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who
says thus: ‘I declare the result of these five things having
realised it myself with direct knowledge’?” - “No, Master
Gotama.” [200]</P>
<P  >“How
then, student, the ancient brahmin seers, the creators of the hymns,
the composers of the hymns, whose ancient hymns</P>
<P  >that
were formerly chanted, uttered, and compiled the brahmins nowadays
still chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken, reciting what was
recited - that is, Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi,
Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu - did even these
ancient brahmin seers say thus: ‘We declare the result of these
five things having realised it ourselves with direct knowledge’?”
- “No, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“So,
student, it seems that among the brahmins there is not even a single
brahmin who says thus: ‘I declare the result of these five things
having realised it myself with direct knowledge.’ And among the
brahmins there is not even a single teacher or a single teacher’s
teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers, who says thus: ‘I
declare the result of these five things having realised it myself
with direct knowledge.’ And the ancient brahmin seers, the creators
of the hymns, the composers of the hymns … even these ancient
brahmin seers did not say thus: ‘We declare the result of these
five things having realised it ourselves with direct knowledge.’
Suppose there were a file of blind men each in touch with the next:
the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last
one does not see. So too, student, in regard to their statement the
brahmins seem to be like a file of blind men: the first one does not
see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.”</P>
<P  >10.
When this was said, the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, was
angry and displeased with the simile of the file of blind men, and he
reviled, disparaged, and censured the Blessed One, saying: “The
recluse Gotama will be worsted.” Then he said to the Blessed One:
“Master Gotama, the brahrnin Pokkharasati of the Upamanna clan,
lord of the Subhaga Grove, says thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote912anc" HREF="#sdendnote912sym"><SUP>cmxii</SUP></A></SUP>
‘Some recluses and brahmins here claim superhuman states,
distinctions in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. But
what they say [201] turns out to be ridiculous; it turns out to be
mere words, empty and hollow. For how could a human being know or see
or realise a superhuman state, a distinction in knowledge and vision
worthy of the noble ones? That is impossible.’“</P>
<P  >11.
“How then, student, does the brahmin Pokkharasati understand the
minds of all recluses and brahmins, having encompassed them with his
own mind?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Gotama, the brahmin Pokkharasati does not even understand the mind of
his slavewoman Punnika, having encompassed it with his own mind, so
how could he understand thus the minds of all recluses and brahmins?”</P>
<P  >12.
“Student, suppose there were a man born blind who could not see
dark and light forms, who could not see blue, yellow, red, or pink
forms, who could not see what was even and uneven, who could not see
the stars or the sun and moon. He might say thus: ‘There are no
dark and light forms, and no one who sees dark and light forms; there
are no blue, yellow, red, or pink forms, and no one who sees blue,
yellow, red, or pink forms; there is nothing even and uneven, and no
one who sees anything even and uneven; there are no stars and no sun
and moon, and no one who sees stars and the sun and moon. I do not
know these, I do not see these, therefore these do not exist.’
Speaking thus, student, would he be speaking rightly?”</P>
<P  >“No,
Master Gotama. There are dark and light forms, and those who see dark
and light forms … there are the stars and the sun and moon, and
those who see the stars and the sun and moon. [202] Saying, ‘I do
not know these, I do not see these, therefore these do not exist,’
he would not be speaking rightly.”</P>
<P  >13.
“So too, student, the brahmin Pokkharasati is blind and visionless.
That he could know or see or realise a superhuman state, a
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones - this
is impossible. What do you think, student? What is better for those
well-to-do brahmins of Kosala such as the brahmin Canki, the brahmin
Tarukkha, the brahmin Pokkharasati, the brahmin Janussoni, or your
father, the brahmin Todeyya - that the statements they make accord
with worldly convention or flaunt worldly convention?” - “That
they accord with worldly convention, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“What
is better for them, that the statements they make be thoughtful or
thoughtless?” - “Thoughtful, Master Gotama.” - “What is
better for them, that they make their statements after reflecting or
without reflecting?” - “After reflecting, Master Gotama.” -
“What is better for them, that the statements they make be
beneficial or unbeneficial?” - “Beneficial, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >14.
“What do you think, student? If that is so, did the statement made
by the brahmin Pokkharasati accord with worldly convention or flaunt
worldly convention?” - “It flaunted worldly convention, Master
Gotama.” - “Was the statement</P>
<P  >made
thoughtful or thoughtless?” - “Thoughtless, Master Gotama.” -
“Was the statement made after reflecting or without reflecting?”
- “Without reflecting, Master Gotama.” - “Was the statement
made beneficial or unbeneficial?” - “Unbeneficial, Master
Gotama.” [203]</P>
<P  >15.
“Now there are these five hindrances, student. What are the five?
The hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the
hindrance of sloth and torpor, the hindrance of restlessness and
remorse, and the hindrance of doubt. These are the five hindrances.
The brahmin Pokkharasati is obstructed, hindered, blocked, and
enveloped by these five hindrances. That he could know or see or
realise a superhuman state, a distinction in knowledge and vision
worthy of the noble ones - this is impossible.</P>
<P  >16.
“Now there are these five cords of sensual pleasure, student. What
are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.
The brahmin Pokkharasati is tied to these five cords of sensual
pleasure, infatuated with them and utterly committed to them; he
enjoys them without seeing the danger in them or understanding the
escape from them. That he could know or see or realise a superhuman
state, a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
- this is impossible.</P>
<P  >17.
“What do you think, student? Which of these two fires would have a
[better] flame, colour, and radiance - a fire that might burn in
dependence on fuel, such as grass and wood, or a fire that might bum
independent of fuel, such as grass and wood?”</P>
<P  >“If
it were possible, Master Gotama, for a fire to burn independent of
fuel such as grass and wood, that fire would have a [better] flame,
colour, and radiance.”</P>
<P  >“It
is impossible, student, it cannot happen that a fire could burn
independent of fuel such as grass or wood except through [the
exercise of] supernormal power. Like the fire that burns dependent on
fuel such as grass and wood, I say, is the rapture [204] that is
dependent on the five cords of sensual pleasure. Like the fire that
burns independent of fuel such as grass and</P>
<P  >wood,
I say, is the rapture that is apart from sensual pleasures, apart
from unwholesome states. And what, student, is the rapture that is
apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states? Here,
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion. This is a rapture apart from sensual
pleasures, apart from unwholesome states. Again, with the stilling of
applied and sustained thought, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in
the second jhana, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind
without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born
of concentration. This too is a rapture apart from sensual pleasures,
apart from unwholesome states.</P>
<P  >18.
“Of those five things, student, that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, which of the
five do they prescribe as the most fruitful for the performance of
merit, for accomplishing the wholesome?”</P>
<P  >“Of
those five things, Master Gotama, that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, they prescribe
generosity as the most fruitful for the performance of merit, for
accomplishing the wholesome.”</P>
<P  >19.
“What do you think, student? Here a brahmin might be holding a
great sacrifice, and two other brahmins would go there thinking to
take part in that great sacrifice. One brahmin among them would
think: ‘Oh, that only I might get the best seat, the best water,
the best almsfood in the refectory; that no other brahmin might get
the best seat, the best water, the best almsfood in the refectory!’
And it is possible that the other brahmin, not that brahmin, gets the
best seat, the best water, the best almsfood in the refectory.
Thinking about this, [205] the first brahmin might become angry and
displeased. What kind of result do the brahmins describe for this?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Gotama, brahmins do not give gifts in such a way, thinking: ‘Let
the others become angry and displeased because of this.’ Rather,
brahmins give gifts motivated by compassion.”</P>
<P  >“That
being so, student, isn’t this the brahmins’ sixth basis for the
performance of merit, that is, the motive of compassion?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote913anc" HREF="#sdendnote913sym"><SUP>cmxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“That
being so, Master Gotama, this is the brahmins’ sixth basis for the
performance of merit, that is, the motive of compassion.”</P>
<P  >20.
“Those five things, student, that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome - where do you
often see those five things, among householders or among those gone
forth?”</P>
<P  >“Those
five things, Master Gotama, that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, I often see
among those gone forth, seldom among householders. For the
householder has a great deal of activity, great functions, great
engagements, and great undertakings: he does not constantly and
invariably speak the truth, practise asceticism, observe celibacy,
engage in study, or engage in generosity. But one gone forth has a
small amount of activity, small functions, small engagements, and
small undertakings: he constantly and invariably speaks the truth,
practises asceticism, observes celibacy, engages in study, and
engages in generosity. Thus those five things that the brahmins
prescribe for the performance of merit, for accomplishing the
wholesome, I often see among those gone forth, seldom among
householders.”</P>
<P  >21.
“Those five things, student, that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, [206] 1 call
equipment of the mind, that is, for developing a mind that is without
hostility and without ill will. Here, student, a bhikkhu is a speaker
of truth. Thinking, ‘I am a speaker of truth,’ he gains
inspiration in the meaning, gains <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://inspiration.in/">inspiration.
in</A></U></FONT> the Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the
Dhamma. It is that gladness connected with the wholesome that I call
an equipment of the mind. Here, student, a bhikkhu is an ascetic …
one who is celibate … one who engages in study … one who engages
in generosity. Thinking, ‘I am one who engages in generosity,’ he
gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma,
gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. It is that gladness
connected with the wholesome that I call an equipment of the mind.
Thus those five things that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, I call
equipment of the mind, that is, for developing a mind that is without
hostility and without ill will.”</P>
<P  >22.
When this was said, the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, said
to the Blessed One: “Master Gotama, I have heard that the recluse
Gotama knows the path to the company of Brahma.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, student? Is the village of Nalakara near here, not far
from here?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir, the village of Nalakara is near here, not far from here.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, student? Suppose there was a man born and raised in the
village of Nalakara, and as soon as he had left Nalakara they asked
him about the path to the village. Would that man be slow or hesitant
in answering?”</P>
<P  >“No,
Master Gotama. Why is that? Because that man has been born and raised
in Nalakara, and is well-acquainted with all the paths to the
village.”</P>
<P  >“Still,
a man born and raised in the village of Nalakara [207] might be slow
or hesitant in answering when asked about the path to the village,
but a Tathagata, when asked about the Brahma-world or the way leading
to the Brahma-world, would never be slow or hesitant in answering. I
understand Brahma, student, and I understand the Brahma-world, and I
understand the way leading to the Brahma-world, and I understand how
one should practise to reappear in the Brahma-world.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote914anc" HREF="#sdendnote914sym"><SUP>cmxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
“Master Gotama, I have heard that the recluse Gotama teaches the
path to the company of Brahma. It would be good if Master Gotama
would teach me the path to the company of Brahma.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
student, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir,” he replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >24.
“What, student, is the path to the company of Brahma? Here a
bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise
the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to
himself, he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind
imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility, and without ill will. When the deliverance of mind by
loving-kindness is developed in this way, no limiting action remains
there, none persists there. Just as a vigorous trumpeter could make
himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters, so too, when
the deliverance of mind by loving-kindness is developed in this way,
no limiting action remains there, none persists there.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote915anc" HREF="#sdendnote915sym"><SUP>cmxv</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the path to the company of Brahma.</P>
<P  >25-27.
“Again, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with compassion … with a mind imbued with appreciative joy … with
a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the
third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere,
and to all as to himself, he abides pervading the all-encompassing
world with a mind imbued with equanimity, abundant, exalted, [208]
immeasurable, without hostility, and without ill will. When the
deliverance of mind by equanimity is developed in this way, no
limiting action remains there, none persists there. Just as a
vigorous trumpeter could make himself heard without difficulty in the
four quarters, so too, when the deliverance of mind by equanimity is
developed in this way, no limiting action remains there, none
persists there. This too is the path to the company of Brahma.”</P>
<P  >28.
When this was said, the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, said
to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent,
Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways,
as though he were turning upright what had been overturned, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a
lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master
Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus.
Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
for refuge for life.</P>
<P  >29.
“And now, Master Gotama, we depart. We are busy and have much to
do.”</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time, student, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >Then
the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, having delighted and
rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, and after
paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he
departed.</P>
<P  >30.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Janussoni was driving out of
Savatthi in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by
white mares.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote916anc" HREF="#sdendnote916sym"><SUP>cmxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
He saw the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, coming in the
distance and asked him: “Now where is Master Bharadvaja coming from
in the middle of the day?”</P>
<P  >“Sir,
I am coming from the presence of the recluse Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“What
does Master Bharadvaja think of the recluse Gotama’s lucidity of
wisdom? He is wise, is he not?” [209]</P>
<P  >“Sir,
who am I to know the recluse Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? One would
surely have to be his equal to know the recluse Gotama’s lucidity
of wisdom.”</P>
<P  >“Master
Bharadvaja praises the recluse Gotama with high praise indeed.”</P>
<P  >“Sir,
who am I to praise the recluse Gotama? The recluse Gotama is praised
by the praised as best among gods and humans. Sir, those five things
that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit, for
accomplishing the wholesome, the recluse Gotama calls equipment of
the mind, that is, for developing a mind that is without hostility
and without ill will.”</P>
<P  >31.
When this was said, the brahmin Janussoni got down from his all-white
chariot drawn by white mares, and after arranging his upper robe on
one shoulder, he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards
the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation: “It is a gain for
King Pasenadi of Kosala, it is a great gain for King Pasenadi of
Kosala that the Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened, lives
in his realm.”</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading101"  >
100. Sangarava Sutta - To Sangarava</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a brahmin woman named Dhananjani was staying at
Candalakappa, having full confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and
the Sangha.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote917anc" HREF="#sdendnote917sym"><SUP>cmxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
One time she stumbled, and [on recovering her balance] exclaimed
three times: “Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened! Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished [210] and fully
enlightened!”</P>
<P  >3.
At the time there was a brahmin student named Sangarava staying at
Candalakappa. He was a master of the Three Vedas, with their
vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as
the fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he was fully versed in
natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. Having heard the
brahmin woman Dhananjani utter those words, he said to her: “This
brahmin woman Dhananjani must be disgraced and degraded, since when
there are brahmins around she praises that bald-pated recluse.”</P>
<P  >[She
replied:] “My dear sir, you do not know the virtue and wisdom of
the Blessed One. If you knew that Blessed One’s virtue and wisdom,
my dear sir, you would never think of abusing and reviling him.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
madam, inform me when the recluse Gotama comes to Candalakappa.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
dear sir,” the brahmin woman Dhananjani replied.</P>
<P  >4.
Then, after wandering by stages in the Kosalan country, the Blessed
One eventually arrived at Candalakappa. There in Candalakappa the
Blessed One lived in the Mango Grove belonging to the brahmins of the
Todeyya clan.</P>
<P  >5.
The brahmin woman Dhananjani heard that the Blessed One had arrived,
so she went to the brahmin student Sangarava and told him: “My dear
sir, the Blessed One has arrived in Candalakappa and he is living
here in Candalakappa in the Mango Grove belonging to the brahmins of
the Todeyya clan. Now is the time, dear sir, to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
madam,” he replied. Then he went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous [211] and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said:</P>
<P  >6.
“Master Gotama, there are some recluses and brahmins who claim [to
teach] the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge here and now.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote918anc" HREF="#sdendnote918sym"><SUP>cmxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Where among these recluses and brahmins does Master Gotama stand?”</P>
<P  >7.
“Bharadvaja, I say that there is a diversity among those recluses
and brahmins who claim [to teach] the fundamentals of the holy life
after having reached. the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge here and now. There are some recluses and brahmins who are
traditionalists, who on the basis of oral tradition claim [to teach]
the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge here and now; such
are the brahmins of the Three Vedas. There are some recluses and
brahmins who, entirely on the basis of mere faith, claim [to teach]
the fundamentals of the holy life after having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge; such are the
reasoners and investigators.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote919anc" HREF="#sdendnote919sym"><SUP>cmxix</SUP></A></SUP>
There are some recluses and brahmins who, having directly known the
Dhamma for themselves<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote920anc" HREF="#sdendnote920sym"><SUP>cmxx</SUP></A></SUP>
among things not heard before, claim [to teach] the fundamentals of
the holy life after having reached the consummation and perfection of
direct knowledge.</P>
<P  >8.
“I, Bharadvaja, am one of those recluses and brahmins who, having
directly known the Dhamma for themselves among things not heard
before, claim [to teach] the fundamentals of the holy life after
having reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.
As to how I am one of those recluses and brahmins, that may be
understood in the following way.</P>
<P  >9.
“Here, Bharadvaja, before my enlightenment, while I was still only
an unenlightened Bodhisatta, I considered thus:</P>
<P  >‘Household
life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not
easy while living in a home to lead the holy life utterly perfect and
pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put
on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into
homelessness.’</P>
<P  >10-13.
“Later, Bharadvaja, [212] while still young … (as Sutta 26,
§§14-17) … And I sat down thinking: ‘This will serve for
striving.’</P>
<P  >14-30.
“Now these three similes occurred to me spontaneously never heard
before … (as Sutta 36, §§17-33; but in the present sutta in
§§17-22 - corresponding to §§20-25 of Sutta 36 - the sentence
“But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind
and remain” does not occur) … the five bhikkhus were disgusted
and left me, thinking: ‘The recluse Gotama now lives luxuriously;
he has given up his striving and reverted to luxury.’</P>
<P  >31-41.
“Now when I had eaten solid food and regained my strength, then
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states … (as Sutta 36, §§34-44; but in the present sutta in §§36,
38, and 41 - corresponding to §§39, 41, and 44 of Sutta 36 - the
sentence “But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade
my mind and remain” does not occur) … as happens in one who
abides diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</P>
<P  >42.
When this was said, the brahmin student Sangarava said to the Blessed
One: “Master Gotama’s striving was unfaltering, Master Gotama’s
striving was that of a true man, as it should be for an Accomplished
One, a Fully Enlightened One. But how is it, Master Gotama, are there
gods?”</P>
<P  >“It
is known to me to be the case, Bharadvaja, that there are gods.”</P>
<P  >“But
how is this, Master Gotama, that when you are asked, ‘Are there
gods?’ you say: ‘It is known to me to be the case, Bharadvaja,
that there are gods’? If that is so, isn’t what you say empty and
false?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote921anc" HREF="#sdendnote921sym"><SUP>cmxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Bharadvaja,
when one is asked, ‘Are there gods?’ [213] whether one answers,
‘There are gods,’ or ‘It is known to me to be the case [that
there are gods],’ a wise man can draw the definite conclusion that
there are gods.”</P>
<P  >“But
why didn’t Master Gotama answer me in the first way?”</P>
<P  >“It
is widely accepted in the world, Bharadvaja, that there are gods.”</P>
<P  >43.
When this was said, the brahmin student Sangarava said to the Blessed
One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he
were turning upright what had been overturned, revealing what was
hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in
the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama
for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let
Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for
refuge for life.”</P>

101. Devadaha Sutta - At Devadaha</H2>
<P  >[214]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named Devadaha. There the
Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable
sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, there are some recluses and brahmins who hold such a
doctrine and view as this: ‘Whatever this person feels, whether
pleasure or pain or neither-pain-nor-pleasure, all that is caused by
what was done in the past.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote922anc" HREF="#sdendnote922sym"><SUP>cmxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
So by annihilating with asceticism past actions<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote923anc" HREF="#sdendnote923sym"><SUP>cmxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
and by doing no fresh actions, there will be no consequence in the
future. With no consequence in the future, there is the destruction
of action. With the destruction of action, there is the destruction
of suffering. With the destruction of suffering, there is the
destruction of feeling. With the destruction of feeling, all
suffering will be exhausted.’ So speak the Niganthas, bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >3.
“I go to the Niganthas who speak thus and I say: ‘Friend
Niganthas, is it true that you hold such a doctrine and view as this:
“Whatever this person feels … all suffering will be exhausted”?’
If, when they are asked thus, the Niganthas admit this and say ‘Yes,’
I say to them:</P>
<P  >4.
“‘But, friends, do you know that you existed in the past, and
that it is not the case that you did not exist?’ - ‘No, friend.’
- ‘But, friends, do you know that you did evil actions in the past
and did not abstain from them?’ - ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But,
friends, do you know that so much suffering has already been
exhausted, or that so much suffering has still to be exhausted, or
that when so much suffering has been exhausted all suffering will
have been exhausted?’ - [215] ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But, friends,
do you know what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the
cultivation of wholesome states is here and now?’ - ‘No, friend.’</P>
<P  >5.
“‘So, friends, it seems that you do not know that you existed in
the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist; or that
you did evil actions in the past and did not abstain from them; or
that you did such and such evil actions; or that so much suffering
has already been exhausted, or that so much suffering has still to be
exhausted, or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all
suffering will have been exhausted; or what the abandoning of
unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of wholesome states is
here and now. That being so, it is not fitting for the venerable
Niganthas to declare: “Whatever this person feels, whether pleasure
or pain or neither-painnor-pleasure, all that is caused by what was
done in the past. So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and
by doing no fresh actions, there will be no consequence in the
future. With no consequence in the future … all suffering will be
exhausted.”</P>
<P  >6.
“‘If, friend Niganthas, you knew that you existed in the past and
that it is not the case that you did not exist; or that you did evil
actions in the past and did not abstain from them; or that you did
such and such evil actions; or that so much suffering has already
been. exhausted, or that so much suffering has still to be exhausted,
or that when so much suffering has been exhausted all suffering will
have been exhausted; or what the abandoning of unwholesome states is
and what the cultivation of wholesome states is here and now; that
being so, it would be fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare:
“Whatever this person feels … [216] … all suffering will be
exhausted.”</P>
<P  >7.
“‘Friend Niganthas, suppose a man were wounded by an arrow
thickly smeared with poison, and because of this he felt painful,
racking, piercing feelings. Then his friends and companions, kinsmen
and relatives, brought a surgeon. The surgeon would cut around the
opening of the wound with a knife, probe for the arrow with a probe,
pull out the arrow, and apply a medicinal cauteriser to the opening
of the wound, and at each step the man would feel painful, racking,
piercing feelings. Then on a later occasion, when the wound was
healed and covered with skin, the man would be well and happy,
independent, master of himself, able to go where he likes. He might
think: “Formerly I was pierced by an arrow thickly smeared with
poison, and because of this I felt painful, racking, piercing
feelings. Then my friends and companions, kinsmen and relatives,
brought a surgeon. The surgeon cut around the opening of the wound
with a knife, probed for the arrow with a probe, pulled out the
arrow, and applied a medicinal cauteriser to the opening of the
wound, and at each step I felt painful, racking, piercing feelings.
[217] But now that the wound is healed and covered with skin, I am
well and happy, independent, my own master, able to go where I like.”</P>
<P  >8.
“‘So too, friend Niganthas, if you knew that you existed in the
past and that it is not the case that you did not exist … or what
the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation of
wholesome states is here and now; that being so, it would be fitting
for the venerable Niganthas to declare: “Whatever this person feels
… all suffering will be exhausted.”</P>
<P  >9.
“‘But since, friend Niganthas, you do not know that you existed
in the past and that it is not the case that you did not exist … or
what the abandoning of unwholesome states is and what the cultivation
of wholesome states is here and now, it is not fitting for the
venerable Niganthas to declare: “Whatever this person feels … all
suffering will be exhausted.’“</P>
<P  >10.
“When this was said, the Niganthas told me: [218] ‘Friend, the
Nigantha Nataputta is omniscient and all-seeing and claims to have
complete knowledge and vision thus: “Whether I am walking or
standing or asleep or awake, knowledge and vision are continuously
and uninterruptedly present to me.” He says thus: “Niganthas, you
have done evil actions in the past; exhaust them with the performance
of piercing austerities. And when you are here and now restrained in
body, speech, and mind, that is doing no evil actions for the future.
So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no fresh
actions, there will be no consequence in the future. With no
consequence in the future … all suffering will be exhausted.” We
approve of and accept this, and so we are satisfied.’</P>
<P  >11.
“When this was said, I told the Niganthas:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote924anc" HREF="#sdendnote924sym"><SUP>cmxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
‘There are five things, friend Niganthas, that may turn out in two
different ways here and now. What five? They are: faith, approval,
oral tradition, reasoned cogitation, and reflective acceptance of a
view. These five things may turn out in two different ways here and
now. Herein, what kind of faith do the venerable Niganthas have in a
teacher who speaks about the past? What kind of approval, what kind
of oral tradition, what kind of reasoned cogitation, what kind of
reflective acceptance of a view?’ Speaking thus, bhikkhus, I did
not see any legitimate defence of their position by the Niganthas.</P>
<P  >12.
“Again, bhikkhus, I said to the Niganthas: ‘What do you think,
friend Niganthas? When there is intense exertion, intense striving,
do you then feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to intense
exertion? But when there is no intense exertion, no intense striving,
do you then not feel any painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
intense exertion?’ - ‘When there is intense exertion, friend
Gotama, intense striving, then we feel painful, racking, piercing
feelings due to intense exertion; [219] but when there is no intense
exertion, no intense striving, then we do not feel any painful,
racking, piercing feelings due to intense exertion.’</P>
<P  >13.
“‘So it seems, friend Niganthas, that when there is intense
exertion … you feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
intense exertion; but when there is no intense exertion … you do
not feel any painful, racking, piercing feelings due to intense
exertion. That being so, it is not fitting for the venerable
Niganthas to declare:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote925anc" HREF="#sdendnote925sym"><SUP>cmxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
“Whatever this person feels, whether pleasure or pain or
neither-pain-nor-pleasure, all that is caused by what was done in the
past. So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no
fresh actions, there will be no consequence in the future. With no
consequence … all suffering will be exhausted.”</P>
<P  >14.
“‘If, friend Niganthas, when there was intense exertion, intense
striving, then painful, racking, piercing feelings due to intense
exertion were present, and when there was no intense exertion, no
intense striving, then painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
intense exertion were still present; that being so, it would be
fitting for the venerable Niganthas to declare: “Whatever this
person feels … all suffering will be exhausted.”</P>
<P  >15.
“‘But since, friend Niganthas, when there is intense exertion,
intense striving, then you feel painful, racking, piercing feelings
due to intense exertion, but when there is no intense exertion, no
intense striving, then you do not feel painful, racking, piercing
feelings due to intense exertion, you are therefore feeling only the
painful, racking, piercing feelings of your self imposed exertion,
and it is through ignorance, unknowing, and delusion [220] that you
mistakenly hold: “Whatever this person feels … all suffering will
be exhausted.’“Speaking thus, bhikkhus, I did not see any
legitimate defence of their position by the Niganthas.</P>
<P  >16.
“Again, bhikkhus, I said to the Niganthas: ‘What do you think,
friend Niganthas? Is it possible that an action [whose result] is to
be experienced here and now<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote926anc" HREF="#sdendnote926sym"><SUP>cmxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
can, through exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to
be experienced in the next life?’ - ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But is
it possible that an action [whose result] is to be experienced in the
next life can, through exertion and striving, become one [whose
result] is to be experienced here and now?’ -’No, friend.’</P>
<P  >17.
“‘What do you think, friend Niganthas? Is it possible that an
action [whose result] is to be experienced as pleasant can, through
exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be experienced
as painful?’ - ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But is it possible that an
action [whose result] is to be experienced as painful can, through
exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be experienced
as pleasant?’ -’No, friend.’</P>
<P  >18.
“‘What do you think, friend Niganthas? Is it possible that an
action [whose result] is to be experienced in a matured [personality]
can, by exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be
experienced in an unmatured [personality]?’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote927anc" HREF="#sdendnote927sym"><SUP>cmxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
- ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But is it possible that an action [whose
result] is to be experienced in an unmatured [personality] can, by
exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be experienced
in a matured personality?’ -’No, friend.’</P>
<P  >19.
“‘What do you think, friend Niganthas? [221] Is it possible that
an action [whose result] is to be much experienced can, through
exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be little
experienced?’ - ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But is it possible that an
action [whose result] is to be little experienced can, through
exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be much
experienced?’ -’No, friend.’</P>
<P  >20.
“‘What do you think, friend Niganthas? Is it possible that an
action [whose result] is to be experienced can, through exertion and
striving, become one [whose result] is not to be experienced?’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote928anc" HREF="#sdendnote928sym"><SUP>cmxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
- ‘No, friend.’ - ‘But is it possible that an action [whose
result] is not to be experienced can, through exertion and striving,
become one [whose result] is to be experienced?’ - ‘No, friend.’</P>
<P  >21.
“‘So it seems, friend Niganthas, that it is impossible that an
action [whose result] is to be experienced here and now can, through
exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be experienced
in the next life, and impossible that an action [whose result] is to
be experienced in the next life can, through exertion and striving,
become one [whose result] is to be experienced here and now;
impossible that an action [whose result] is to be experienced as
pleasant can, through exertion and striving, become one [whose
result] is to be experienced as painful, and impossible that an
action [whose result] is to be experienced as painful can, through
exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is to be experienced
as pleasant; impossible that an action [whose result] is to be
experienced in a matured [personality] can, by exertion and striving,
become one [whose result] is to be experienced in an unmatured
[personality], and impossible that an action [whose result] is to be
experienced in an unmatured [personality] can, through exertion and
striving, become one [whose result] is to be experienced in a matured
[personality]; impossible that an action [whose result] is to be much
experienced can, through exertion and striving, become one [whose
result] is to be little experienced, and impossible that an action
[whose result] is to be little experienced can, through exertion and
striving, become one [whose result] is to be much experienced;
impossible that an action [whose result] is to be experienced can,
through exertion and striving, become one [whose result] is not to be
experienced, and impossible that an action [whose result] is not to
be experienced can, through exertion and striving, become one [whose
result] is to be experienced. That being so, the venerable Niganthas’
exertion is fruitless, [222] their striving is fruitless.’</P>
<P  >22.
“So speak the Niganthas, bhikkhus. And because the Niganthas speak
thus, there are ten legitimate deductions from their assertions that
provide ground for censuring them:</P>
<P  >(1)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was
done in the past, then the Niganthas surely must have done bad deeds
in the past, since they now feel such painful, racking, piercing
feelings.</P>
<P  >(2)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the
creative act of a Supreme God,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote929anc" HREF="#sdendnote929sym"><SUP>cmxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
then the Niganthas surely must have been created by an evil Supreme
God, since they now feel such painful, racking, piercing feelings.</P>
<P  >(3)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by
circumstance and nature,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote930anc" HREF="#sdendnote930sym"><SUP>cmxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
then the Niganthas surely must have bad luck, since they now feel
such painful, racking, piercing feelings.</P>
<P  >(4)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class
[among the six classes of birth]<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote931anc" HREF="#sdendnote931sym"><SUP>cmxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
then the Niganthas surely must belong to a bad class, since they now
feel such painful, racking, piercing feelings.</P>
<P  >(5)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion
here and now, then the Niganthas surely must strive badly here and
now, since they now feel such painful, racking, piercing feelings.</P>
<P  >(6)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was
done in the past, then the Niganthas are to be censured; if not, then
the Niganthas are still to be censured.</P>
<P  >(7)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by the
creative act of a Supreme God, then the Niganthas are to be censured;
if not, they are still to be censured.</P>
<P  >(8)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by chance,
then the Niganthas are to be censured; if not, they are still to be
censured.</P>
<P  >(9)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by class,
then the Niganthas are to be censured; if not, they are still to be
censured.</P>
<P  >(10)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion
here and now, [223] then the Niganthas are to be censured; if not,
they are still to be censured.</P>
<P  >“So
speak the Niganthas, bhikkhus. And because the Niganthas speak thus,
these ten legitimate deductions from their assertions provide grounds
for censuring them. Thus their exertion is fruitless, their striving
is fruitless.</P>
<P  >23.
“And how is exertion fruitful, bhikkhus, how is striving fruitful?
Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is not overwhelmed by suffering and does
not overwhelm himself with suffering; and he does not give up the
pleasure that accords with Dhamma, yet he is not infatuated with that
pleasure.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote932anc" HREF="#sdendnote932sym"><SUP>cmxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
He knows thus: ‘When I strive with determination, this particular
source of suffering fades away in me because of that determined
striving; and when I look on with equanimity, this particular source
of suffering fades away in me while I develop equanimity.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote933anc" HREF="#sdendnote933sym"><SUP>cmxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
He strives with determination in regard to that particular source of
suffering which fades away in him because of that determined
striving; and he develops equanimity in regard to that particular
source of suffering which fades away in him while he is developing
equanimity. When he strives with determination, such and such a
source of suffering fades away in him because of that determined
striving; thus that suffering is exhausted in him. When he looks on
with equanimity, such and such a source of suffering fades away in
him while he develops equanimity; thus that suffering is exhausted in
him.</P>
<P  >24.
“Suppose, bhikkhus, a man loved a woman with his mind bound to her
by intense desire and passion. He might see that woman standing with
another man, chatting, joking, and laughing. What do you think,
bhikkhus? Would not sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair
arise in that man when he sees that woman standing with another man,
chatting, joking, and laughing?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because that man loves that woman with
his mind bound to her by intense desire and passion; [224] that is
why sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair would arise in him
when he sees her standing with another man, chatting, joking, and
laughing.”</P>
<P  >25.
“Then, bhikkhus, the man might think: ‘I love this woman with my
mind bound to her by intense desire and passion; thus sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise in me when I see her
standing with another man, chatting, joking, and laughing. What if I
were to abandon my desire and lust for that woman?’ He would
abandon his desire and lust for that woman. On a later occasion he
might see that woman standing with another man, chatting, joking, and
laughing. What do you think, bhikkhus? Would sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair arise in that man when he sees that woman
standing with another man … ?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because that man no longer loves that
woman; that is why sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair do
not arise in him when he sees that woman standing with another man …
”</P>
<P  >26.
“So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is not overwhelmed by suffering
and does not overwhelm himself with suffering … (as in §23 above)
[225] … thus that suffering is exhausted in him. Thus, bhikkhus,
the exertion is fruitful, the striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >27.
“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu considers thus: ‘While I live
according to my pleasure, unwholesome states increase in me and
wholesome states diminish; but when I exert myself in what is
painful, unwholesome states diminish in me and wholesome states
increase. What if I exert myself in what is painful?’ He exerts
himself in what is painful. When he does so, unwholesome states
diminish in him and wholesome states increase.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote934anc" HREF="#sdendnote934sym"><SUP>cmxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
At a later time he does not exert himself in what is painful. Why is
that? The purpose for which that bhikkhu exerted himself in what is
painful has been achieved; that is why at a later time he does not
exert himself in what is painful.</P>
<P  >28.
“Suppose, bhikkhus, an arrowsmith were warming and heating an arrow
shaft between two flames, making it straight and workable. When the
arrow shaft had been warmed and heated between the two flames and had
been made straight and workable, then at a later time he would not
again warm and heat the arrow shaft and make it straight and
workable. Why is that? The purpose for which that arrowsmith had

“So too, a bhikkhu considers thus … (as in §27 above) [226] …
that is why at a later time he does not exert himself in what is
painful. Thus too, bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the striving
is fruitful.</P>
<P  >30-37.
“Again, bhikkhus, here a Tathagata appears in the world,
accomplished, fully enlightened … (as Sutta 51, §§12-19) … he
purifies his mind from doubt.</P>
<P  >38.
“Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. Thus too, bhikkhus, the
exertion is fruitful, the striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >39.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which
has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.
Thus too, bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the striving is
fruitful.</P>
<P  >40.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the fading away as well of rapture, a
bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still
feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the
third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a
pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’ Thus too,
bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >41.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and
with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity. Thus too, bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the
striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >42.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one
birth, two births … (as Sutta 51, §24) … Thus with their aspects
and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. Thus too,
bhikkhus, the exertion is fruitful, the striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >43.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 51, §25) … Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions. Thus too, bhikkhus, the exertion is
fruitful, the striving is fruitful. [227]</P>
<P  >44.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the</P>
<P  >destruction
of the taints. He understands as it actually is: ‘This is
suffering’; … ‘This is the origin of suffering’; … ‘This
is the cessation of suffering’; … ‘This is the way leading to
the cessation of suffering’; … ’These are the taints’; …
’This is the origin of the taints’; … ’This is the cessation
of the taints’; … ’This is the way leading to the cessation of
the taints.’</P>
<P  >45.
“When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It is
liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’ Thus too, bhikkhus, the exertion is
fruitful, the striving is fruitful.</P>
<P  >46.
“So the Tathagata speaks, bhikkhus. And because the Tathagata
speaks thus, there are ten legitimate grounds for praising him:</P>
<P  >(1)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by what was
done in the past, then the Tathagata surely must have done good deeds
in the past, since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelings.</P>
<P  >(2)

<P  >(5)
“If the pleasure and pain that beings feel are caused by exertion
here and now, then the Tathagata surely must strive well here and
now, since he now feels such taintless pleasant feelings.</P>

103. Kinti Sutta - What Do You Think About Me?</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Kusinara, in the Grove of Offerings. There he addressed the bhikkhus
thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,” they replied. The
Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“What do you think about me, bhikkhus? That the recluse Gotama
teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes? Or that the recluse Gotama
teaches the Dhamma for the sake of almsfood? Or that the recluse
Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of a resting place? Or that
the recluse Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of some better
state of being?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote969anc" HREF="#sdendnote969sym"><SUP>cmlxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“We
do not think thus about the Blessed One: ‘The recluse Gotama
teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes, or for the sake of
almsfood, or for the sake of a resting place, or for the sake of some
better state of being.’“</P>
<P  >“So,
bhikkhus, you do not think thus about me: ‘The recluse Gotama
teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes … or for the sake of some
better state of being.’ Then what do you think about me?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, we think thus about the Blessed One: ‘The Blessed One is
compassionate and seeks our welfare; he teaches the Dhamma out of
compassion.’“</P>
<P  >“So,
bhikkhus, you think thus about me: ‘The Blessed One is
compassionate and seeks our welfare; he teaches the Dhamma out of
compassion.’</P>
<P  >3.
“So, bhikkhus, these things that I have taught you after directly
knowing them - that is, the four foundations of mindfulness, the four
right kinds of striving, the four bases for spiritual power, the five
faculties, the five powers, the seven [239] enlightenment factors,
the Noble Eightfold Path - in these things you should all train in
concord, with mutual appreciation, without disputing.</P>
<P  >4.
“While you are training in concord, with mutual appreciation,

Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote970anc" HREF="#sdendnote970sym"><SUP>cmlxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Now if you should think thus: ‘These venerable ones differ about
both the meaning and the phrasing,’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote971anc" HREF="#sdendnote971sym"><SUP>cmlxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
then whichever bhikkhu you think is the more reasonable should be
approached and addressed thus: ‘The venerable ones differ about
both the meaning and the phrasing. The venerable ones should know
that it is for this reason that there is difference about the meaning
and difference about the phrasing; let them not fall into a dispute.’
Then whichever bhikkhu you think is the most reasonable of those who
side together on the opposite part should be approached and addressed
thus: ‘The venerable ones differ about the meaning and the
phrasing. The venerable ones should know that it is for this reason
that there is difference about the meaning and difference about the
phrasing; let them not fall into a dispute.’ So what has been
wrongly grasped should be borne in mind as wrongly grasped. Bearing
in mind what has been wrongly grasped as wrongly grasped, what is
Dhamma and what is Discipline should be expounded.</P>
<P  >6.
“Now if you should think thus: ‘These venerable ones differ about
the meaning but agree about the phrasing,’ then whichever bhikkhu
you think is the more reasonable should be approached and addressed
thus: ‘The venerable ones differ about the meaning but agree about
the phrasing. The venerable ones should know that it is for this

in mind what has been wrongly grasped as wrongly grasped, and bearing
in mind what has been rightly grasped as rightly grasped, what is
Dhamma and what is Discipline should be expounded.</P>
<P  >7.
“Now if you think thus: ‘These venerable ones agree about the

“Now, bhikkhus, you should not hurry to reprove him; rather, the
person should be examined thus: ‘I shall not be troubled and the
other person will not be hurt; for the other person is not given to
anger and revenge, he is not firmly attached to his view and he

“While you are training in concord, with mutual appreciation,
without disputing, there might arise mutual verbal friction,

together on the one part should be approached and addressed thus:

104. Samagama Sutta - At Samagama</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Sakyan country at Samagama.</P>

Now on that occasion the Nigantha Nataputta had just died at Pava.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote976anc" HREF="#sdendnote976sym"><SUP>cmlxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
On his death the Niganthas divided, split into two; and they had
taken to quarrelling and brawling and were deep in disputes, stabbing
each other with verbal daggers: “You do not understand this Dhamma
and Discipline. I understand this Dhamma and Discipline. How could
you understand this Dhamma and Discipline? Your way is wrong. My way
is right. I am consistent. You are inconsistent. What should have
been said first [244] you said last. What should have been said last
you said first. What you had so carefully thought up has been turned
inside out. Your assertion has been shown up. You are refuted. Go and
learn better, or disentangle yourself if you can!” It seemed as if
there were nothing but slaughter among the Nigantha Nataputta’s
pupils. And his white-clothed lay disciples were disgusted, dismayed,
and disappointed with the Nigantha Nataputta’s pupils, as they were
with his badly proclaimed and badly expounded Dhamma and Discipline,
which was unemancipating, unconducive to peace, expounded by one not
fully enlightened, and was now with its shrine broken, left without a
refuge.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote977anc" HREF="#sdendnote977sym"><SUP>cmlxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then the novice Cunda,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote978anc" HREF="#sdendnote978sym"><SUP>cmlxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
who had spent the Rains at Pava, went to the venerable Ananda, and
after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told him what
was taking place.</P>
<P  >The
venerable Ananda then said to the novice Cunda: “Friend Cunda, this
is news that should be told to the Blessed One. Come, let us approach
the Blessed One and tell him this.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” the novice Cunda replied.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the venerable Ananda and the novice Cunda went together to the
Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side,
and [245] the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: “This
novice Cunda, venerable sir, says thus: ‘Venerable sir, the
Nigantha Nataputta has just died. On his death the Niganthas divided,
split into two … and is now with its shrine broken, left without a
refuge.’ I thought, venerable sir: ‘Let no dispute arise in the
Sangha when the Blessed One has gone. For such a dispute would be for
the harm and unhappiness of many, for the loss, harm, and suffering
of gods and humans.’“</P>
<P  >5.
“What do you think, Ananda? These things that I have taught you
after directly knowing them - that is, the four foundations of
mindfulness, the four right kinds of striving, the four bases for
spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven

even two bhikkhus who make differing assertions about these things?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir, I do not see even two bhikkhus who make differing
assertions about these things. But, venerable sir, there are people
who live deferential towards the Blessed One who might, when he has
gone, create a dispute in the Sangha about livelihood and about the
Patimokkha.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote979anc" HREF="#sdendnote979sym"><SUP>cmlxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Such a dispute would be for the harm and unhappiness of many, for the

What six? Here, Ananda, a bhikkhu is angry and revengeful. Such a

the training. A bhikkhu who dwells disrespectful and undeferential
towards the Teacher, towards the Dhamma, and towards the Sangha,
[246] and who does not fulfil the training, creates a dispute in the
Sangha, which would be for the harm and unhappiness of many, for the
loss, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. Now if you see any such
root of dispute either in yourselves or externally, you should strive

<P  >that
same evil root of dispute. And if you do not see any such root of
dispute either in yourselves or externally, you should practise in
such a way that that same evil root of dispute does not erupt in the

thus there is the non-eruption of that evil root of dispute in the
future.</P>
<P  >7-11.
“Again, a bhikkhu is contemptuous and domineering … envious and
avaricious … deceitful and fraudulent … has evil wishes and wrong
view … adheres to his own views, holds on to them tenaciously, and
relinquishes them with difficulty. Such a bhikkhu dwells
disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher, towards the
Dhamma, and towards the Sangha, and he does not fulfil the training.
A bhikkhu who dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the

that accords with the Dhamma, including even what is in his bowl.
This is a memorable quality that creates love and respect, and
conduces to … unity.</P>
<P  >“Again,
a bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private possessing in common
with his companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken,
untorn, unblotched, unmottled, liberating, commended by the wise, not
misapprehended, and conducive to concentration. This too is a
memorable quality that creates love and respect and conduces to …

<P  >[252]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus had declared final
knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One thus: “We understand:
Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done
has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.”</P>
<P  >3.
Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote995anc" HREF="#sdendnote995sym"><SUP>cmxcv</SUP></A></SUP>
heard: “A number of bhikkhus, it seems, have declared final
knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One thus: ‘We understand:
Birth is destroyed … there is no more coming to any state of
being.’“Then Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, went to the
Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side
and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >4.
“I have heard, venerable sir, that a number of bhikkhus have
declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One. Did they
do so rightly or are there some bhikkhus here who declare final
knowledge because they overestimate themselves?”</P>
<P  >5.
“When those bhikkhus, Sunakkhatta, declared final knowledge in my
presence, there were some bhikkhus who declared final knowledge
rightly and there were some who declared final knowledge because they
overestimated themselves.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote996anc" HREF="#sdendnote996sym"><SUP>cmxcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Therein, when bhikkhus declare final knowledge rightly, their
declaration is true. But when bhikkhus declare final knowledge
because they overestimate themselves, the Tathagata thinks: ‘Let me
teach them the Dhamma.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote997anc" HREF="#sdendnote997sym"><SUP>cmxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Thus it is in this case, Sunakkhatta, that the Tathagata thinks: ‘Let
me teach them the Dhamma.’ But some misguided men here formulate a
question, come to the Tathagata, and ask it. In that case,
Sunakkhatta, [253] though the</P>
<P  >Tathagata
has thought: ‘Let me teach them the Dhamma,’ he changes his
mind.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote998anc" HREF="#sdendnote998sym"><SUP>cmxcviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“This is the time, Blessed One, this is the time, Sublime One, for
the Blessed One to teach the Dhamma. Having heard it from the Blessed
One, the bhikkhus will remember it.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, Sunakkhatta, and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, replied to the
Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >7.
“There are, Sunakkhatta, these five cords of sensual pleasure. What
are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >8.
“It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some person here may be intent
on worldly material things.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote999anc" HREF="#sdendnote999sym"><SUP>cmxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
When a person is intent on worldly material things, only talk
concerning that interests him, and his thinking and pondering are in
line with that, and he associates with that kind of person, and he
finds satisfaction through him. But when talk about the imperturbable
is going on, he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his
mind to understand it. He does not associate with that kind of
person, and he does not find satisfaction through him.</P>
<P  >9.
“Suppose, Sunakkhatta, a man had left his own village or town a
long time ago, and he were to see another man who had only recently
left that village or town. He would ask that man whether the people
of that village or town were safe, prosperous, and healthy, and that
man would tell him whether the people of that village or town were
safe, prosperous, [254] and healthy. What do you think, Sunakkhatta?
Would that first man listen to him., give him ear, and exert his mind
to understand?” - “Yes, venerable sir.” - “So too,
Sunakkhatta, it is possible that some person here may be intent on
worldly material things. When a person is intent on worldly material
things … and he does not find satisfaction through him. He should
be understood as a person who is intent on worldly material things.</P>

is going on, he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his
mind to understand it. He does not associate with that kind of
person, and he does not find satisfaction through him.</P>
<P  >11.
“Just as a yellow leaf that has fallen from its stalk is incapable
of becoming green again, so too, Sunakkhatta, when a person is intent
on the imperturbable he has shed the fetter of worldly material
things. He should be understood as a person not bound by the fetter
of worldly material things who is intent on the imperturbable.</P>
<P  >12.
“It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some person here may be intent
on the base of nothingness. When a person is intent on the base of
nothingness, only talk concerning that interests him, and his
thinking and pondering are in line with that, and he associates with
that kind of person, and he finds satisfaction through him. [255] But
when talk about the imperturbable is going on, he will not listen to
it or give it ear or exert his mind to understand it. He does not
associate with that kind of person, and he does not find satisfaction
through him.</P>
<P  >13.
“Just as a thick stone that has split in two cannot be joined
together again, so too, Sunakkhatta, when a person is intent on the
base of nothingness his fetter of the imperturbable has been split.
He should be understood as a person not bound by the fetter of the
imperturbable who is intent on the base of nothingness.</P>
<P  >14.
“It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some person here may be intent
on the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. When a person
is intent on the base of neither-perception-nornon-perception, only
talk concerning that interests him, and his thinking and pondering
are in line with that, and he associates with that kind of person,
and he finds satisfaction through him. But when talk about the base

kind of person, and he does not find satisfaction through him.</P>
<P  >15.
“Suppose a person has eaten some delicious food and thrown it up.
What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Could that man have any desire to eat
that food again?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because that food is considered
repulsive.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, Sunakkhatta, when a person is intent on the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, his fetter of the base of
nothingness has been rejected. He should be understood as a person
not bound by the fetter of the base of nothingness who is intent on
the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</P>
<P  >16.
“It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some person here may be
completely intent on Nibbana. When a person is completely intent on
Nibbana, only talk concerning that interests him, and his thinking
and pondering are in line with that, and he associates with that kind
of person, and he finds satisfaction through him. But when talk about
the base of neither-perception-nornon-perception is going on, [256]
he will not listen to it or give it ear or exert his mind to
understand it. He does not associate with that kind of person, and he
does not find satisfaction through him.</P>
<P  >17.
“Just as a palm tree with its top cut off is incapable of growing
again, so too, Sunakkhatta, when a person is completely intent on
Nibbana, his fetter of the base of
neither-perceptionnor-non-perception has been cut off - cut off at
the root, made like a palm stump, done away with so that it is no
longer subject to future arising. He should be understood as a person
not bound by the fetter of the base of

<P  >18.
“It is possible, Sunakkhatta, that some bhikkhu here might think
thus: ‘Craving has been called an arrow by the Recluse;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1001anc" HREF="#sdendnote1001sym"><SUP>mi</SUP></A></SUP>
the poisonous humour of ignorance is spread about by desire, lust,

poisonous humour of ignorance has been expelled. I am one who is
completely intent on Nibbana.’ Because he falsely thinks of himself
thus,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1002anc" HREF="#sdendnote1002sym"><SUP>mii</SUP></A></SUP>
he might pursue those things that are unsuitable for one completely
intent on Nibbana. He might pursue the sight of unsuitable forms with
the eye, he might pursue unsuitable sounds with the ear, unsuitable
odours with the nose, unsuitable flavours with the tongue, unsuitable
tangibles with the body, or unsuitable mind-objects with the mind.
When he pursues the sight of unsuitable forms with the eye …

<P  >19.
“Suppose, Sunakkhatta, a man were wounded by an arrow thickly
smeared with poison, and his friends and companions, his kinsmen and
relatives, brought a surgeon. The surgeon would cut around the
opening of the wound with a knife, then he would probe for the arrow
with a probe, [257] then he would pull out the arrow and would expel
the poisonous humour, leaving a trace of it behind. Knowing that a
trace was left behind,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1003anc" HREF="#sdendnote1003sym"><SUP>miii</SUP></A></SUP>
he would say: ‘Good man, the arrow has been pulled out from you;
the poisonous humour has been expelled with a trace left behind, but
it is incapable of harming you. Eat only suitable food; do not eat
unsuitable food or else the wound may suppurate. From time to time
wash the wound and from time to time anoint its opening, so that pus
and blood do not cover the opening of the wound. Do not walk around
in the wind and sun or else dust and dirt may infect the opening of
the wound. Take care of your wound, good man, and see to it that the
wound heals.’</P>
<P  >20.
“The man would think: ‘The arrow has been pulled out from me; the
poisonous humour has been expelled with no trace left behind, and it
is incapable of harming me.’ He would eat unsuitable food, and the
wound would suppurate. He would not wash the wound from time to time
nor would he anoint its opening from time to time, and pus and blood
would cover the opening of the wound. He would walk around in the
wind and sun, and dust and dirt would infect the opening of the
wound. He would not take care of his wound, nor would he see to it

and because the foul poisonous humour had been expelled with a trace
left behind, the wound would swell, and with its swelling he would
incur death or deadly suffering.</P>
<P  >21.
“So too, Sunakkhatta, it is possible that some bhikkhu here might
think thus: ‘Craving has been called an arrow by the Recluse; the

might pursue those things that are unsuitable for one completely
intent on Nibbana … (as above) … With his mind invaded by lust,

<P  >22.
“For it is death in the Discipline of the Noble One, Sunakkhatta,
when one abandons the training and reverts to the low life; and it is
deadly suffering when one commits some defiled offence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1004anc" HREF="#sdendnote1004sym"><SUP>miv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“Sunakkhatta, I have given this simile in order to convey a
meaning. This is the meaning here: ‘Wound’ is a term for the six
internal bases. ‘Poisonous humour’ is a term for ignorance.
‘Arrow’ is a term for craving. ‘Probe’ is a term for
mindfulness. ‘Knife’ is a term for noble wisdom. ‘Surgeon’ is

Venerable sir, does such a bhikkhu attain Nibbana?”</P>
<P  >“One
bhikkhu here, Ananda, might attain Nibbana, another bhikkhu here
might not attain Nibbana.”</P>
<P  >“What
is the cause and reason, venerable sir, why one bhikkhu here might
attain Nibbana, while another bhikkhu here might not attain Nibbana?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
Ananda, a bhikkhu is practising thus: ‘If it were not, it would not
be mine; it will not be and it will not be mine. What exists, [265]
what has come to be, that I am abandoning.’ Thus he obtains
equanimity. He delights in that equanimity, welcomes it, and remains
holding to it. As he does so, his consciousness becomes dependent on
it and clings to it. A bhikkhu, Ananda, who is affected by clinging
does not attain Nibbana.”</P>
<P  >11.
“But, venerable sir, when that bhikkhu clings, what does he cling
to?”</P>
<P  >“To
the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, Ananda.”</P>
<P  >“When
that bhikkhu clings, venerable sir, it seems he clings to the best
[object of] clinging.”</P>
<P  >“When
that bhikkhu clings, Ananda, he clings to the best [object of]
clinging; for this is the best [object of] clinging, name ly, the
base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1019anc" HREF="#sdendnote1019sym"><SUP>mxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
“Here, Ananda, a bhikkhu is practising thus: ‘If it were not, it
would not be mine; it will not be and it will not be mine. What
exists, what has come to be, that I am abandoning.’ Thus he obtains
equanimity. He does not delight in that equanimity, welcome it, or
remain holding to it. Since he does not do so, his consciousness does
not become dependent on it and does not cling to it. A bhikkhu,
Ananda, who is without clinging attains Nibbana.”</P>
<P  >13.
“It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! The Blessed One,
indeed, has explained to us the crossing of the flood in dependence
upon one support or another.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1020anc" HREF="#sdendnote1020sym"><SUP>mxx</SUP></A></SUP>
But, venerable sir, what is noble liberation?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1021anc" HREF="#sdendnote1021sym"><SUP>mxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Here,
Ananda, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual pleasures here
and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come, sensual perceptions
here and now and sensual perceptions in lives to come, material forms
here and now and material forms in lives to come, perceptions of
forms here and now and perceptions of forms in lives to come,
perceptions of the imperturbable, perceptions of the base of
nothingness, and perceptions of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception - this is personality as far as
personality extends.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1022anc" HREF="#sdendnote1022sym"><SUP>mxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the Deathless, namely, the liberation of the mind through not
clinging.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1023anc" HREF="#sdendnote1023sym"><SUP>mxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
“Thus, Ananda, I have taught the way directed to the imperturbable,
I have taught the way directed to the base of nothingness, I have
taught the way directed to the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I have taught the crossing of
the flood in dependence upon one support or another, I have taught
noble liberation.</P>
<P  >15.
“What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a
teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, [266]
that I have done for you, Ananda. There are these roots of trees,
these empty huts. Meditate, Ananda, do not delay, or else you will
regret it later. This is our instruction to you.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading108"  >
107. Ganakamoggallana Sutta - To Ganaka Moggallana</H2>
<P  >[111.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara’s Mother.
Then the brahmin Ganaka Moggallana went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >2.
“Master Gotama, in this Palace of Migara’s Mother there can be
seen gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress, that
is, down to the last step of the staircase.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1024anc" HREF="#sdendnote1024sym"><SUP>mxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Among these brahmins too, there can be seen gradual training, gradual
practice, and gradual progress, that is, in study. Among archers too,
there can be seen gradual training … that is, in archery. And also
among accountants<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1025anc" HREF="#sdendnote1025sym"><SUP>mxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
like us, who earn our living by accountancy, there can be seen
gradual training … that is, in computation. For when we get an
apprentice first we make him count: one one, two twos, three threes,
four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine
nines, ten tens; and we make him count a hundred too. Now is it also
possible, Master Gotama, to describe gradual training, gradual
practice, and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Discipline?” [2]</P>
<P  >3.
“It is possible, brahmin, to describe gradual training, gradual
practice, and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Discipline. Just
as, brahmin, when a clever horse-trainer obtains a fine thoroughbred
colt, he first makes him get used to wearing the bit, and afterwards
trains him further,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1026anc" HREF="#sdendnote1026sym"><SUP>mxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
so when the Tathagata obtains a person to be tamed he first
disciplines him thus: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be virtuous, restrained with
the restraint of the Patimokkha, be perfect in conduct and resort,
and seeing fear in the slightest fault, train by undertaking the
training precepts.’</P>
<P  >4.
“When, brahmin, the bhikkhu is virtuous … and seeing fear in the
slightest fault, trains by undertaking the training precepts, then
the Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, guard the
doors of your sense faculties. On seeing a form with the eye, do not
grasp at its signs and features. Since, if you were to leave the eye
faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief
might invade you, practise the way of its restraint, guard the eye
faculty, undertake the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a
sound with the ear … On smelling an odour with the nose … On
tasting a flavour with the tongue … On touching a tangible with the
body … On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, do not grasp at
its signs and features. Since, if you were to leave the mind faculty
unguarded, evil unwholesome states might invade you, practise the way
of its restraint, guard the mind faculty, undertake the restraint of
the mind faculty.’</P>
<P  >5.
“When, brahmin, the bhikkhu guards the doors of his sense
faculties, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come,
bhikkhu, be moderate in eating. Reflecting wisely, you should take
food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of
physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and
continuance of this body, for ending discomfort, and for assisting
the holy life, considering: “Thus I shall terminate old feelings
without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless
and shall live in comfort.’“</P>
<P  >6.
“When, [3] brahmin, the bhikkhu is moderate in eating, then the
Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be devoted to
wakefulness. During the day, while walking back and forth and
sitting, purify your mind of obstructive states. In the first watch
of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify your
mind of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night you
should lie down on the right side in the lion’s pose with one foot
overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in your
mind the time for rising. After rising, in the third watch of the
night, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify your mind of
obstructive states.’</P>
<P  >7.
“When, brahmin, the bhikkhu is devoted to wakefulness, then the
Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be possessed of
mindfulness and full awareness. Act in full awareness when going
forward and returning; act in full awareness when looking ahead and
looking away; act in full awareness</P>
<P  >when
flexing and extending your limbs; act in full awareness when wearing
your robes and carrying your outer robe and bowl; act in full
awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; act in
full awareness when defecating and urinating; act in full awareness
when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking,
and keeping silent.’</P>
<P  >8.
“When, brahmin, the bhikkhu possesses mindfulness and full
awareness, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come,
bhikkhu, resort to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of
a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a
jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.’</P>
<P  >9.
“He resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest … a heap of
straw. On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down,
folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing
mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he
abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from
covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind
free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living
beings; he purifies his mind from. ill will and hatred. Abandoning
sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of
light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and
torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated
with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness
and remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt,
unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.
[4]</P>
<P  >10.
“Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. With the stilling of
applied and sustained thought, he enters upon and abides in the
second jhana, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind
without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born
of concentration. With the fading away as well of rapture, he abides
in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure
with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on
account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding
who has equanimity and is mindful.’ With the abandoning of pleasure
and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, he
enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity.</P>
<P  >11.
“This is my instruction, brahmin, to those bhikkhus who are in the
higher training, whose minds have not yet attained the goal, who
abide aspiring to the supreme security from bondage. But these things
conduce both to a pleasant abiding here and now and to mindfulness
and full awareness for those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints
destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done,
laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of
being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1027anc" HREF="#sdendnote1027sym"><SUP>mxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
When this was said, the brahmin Ganaka Moggallana asked the Blessed
One: “When Master Gotama’s disciples are thus advised and
instructed by him, do they all attain Nibbana, the ultimate goal, or
do some not attain it?”</P>
<P  >“When,
brahmin, they are thus advised and instructed by me, some of my
disciples attain Nibbana, the ultimate goal, and some do not attain
it.”</P>
<P  >13.
“Master Gotama, since Nibbana exists and the path leading to
Nibbana exists and Master Gotama is present as the guide, what is the
cause and reason why, when Master Gotama’s disciples are thus
advised and instructed by him, some of them attain Nibbana, the
ultimate goal, and some do not attain it?”</P>
<P  >14.
“As to that, brahmin, I will ask you a question in return. Answer
it as you choose. [5] What do you think, brahmin? Are you familiar
with the road leading to Rajagaha?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
Master Gotama, I am familiar with the road leading to Rajagaha.”</P>
<P  >“What
do you think, brahmin? Suppose a man came who wanted to go to
Rajagaha, and he approached you and said: ‘Venerable sir, I want to
go to Rajagaha. Show me the road to Rajagaha.’ Then you told him:
‘Now, good man, this road goes to Rajagaha. Follow it for awhile
and you will see a certain village, go a little further and you will
see a certain town, go a little further and you will see Rajagaha
with its lovely parks, groves, meadows, and ponds.’ Then, having
been thus advised and instructed by you, he would take a wrong road
and would go to the west. Then a second man came who wanted to go to
Rajagaha, and he approached you and said: ‘Venerable sir, I want to
go to Rajagaha.’ Then you told him: ‘Now, good man, this road
goes to Rajagaha. Follow it for a while … and you will see Rajagaha
with its lovely parks, groves, meadows, and ponds.’ Then, having
been thus advised and instructed by you, he would arrive safely in
Rajagaha. Now, brahmin, since Rajagaha exists and the path leading to
Rajagaha exists and you are present as the guide, what is the cause
and reason why, when those men have been thus advised and instructed
by you, one man takes a wrong road and goes to the west and one
arrives safely in Rajagaha?” [6]</P>
<P  >“What
can I do about that, Master Gotama? I am one who shows the way.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, brahmin, Nibbana exists and the path leading to Nibbana exists
and I am present as the guide. Yet when my disciples have been thus
advised and instructed by me, some of them attain Nibbana, the
ultimate goal, and some do not attain it. What can I do about that,
brahmin? The Tathagata is one who shows the way.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1028anc" HREF="#sdendnote1028sym"><SUP>mxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
When this was said, the brahmin Ganaka Moggallana said to the Blessed
One:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1029anc" HREF="#sdendnote1029sym"><SUP>mxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
“There are persons who are faithless and have gone forth from the
home life into homelessness not out of faith but seeking a
livelihood, who are fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous, haughty,
hollow, personally vain, rough-tongued, loose-spoken, unguarded in
their sense faculties, immoderate in eating, undevoted to
wakefulness, unconcerned with recluseship, not greatly respectful of
training, luxurious, careless, leaders in backsliding, neglectful of
seclusion, lazy, wanting in energy, unmindful, not fully aware,
unconcentrated, with straying minds, devoid of wisdom, drivellers.
Master Gotama does not dwell together with these.</P>
<P  >“But
there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home
life into homelessness, who are not fraudulent, deceitful,
treacherous, haughty, hollow, personally vain, roughtongued, and
loose-spoken; who are guarded in their sense faculties, moderate in
eating, devoted to wakefulness, concerned with recluseship, greatly
respectful of training, not luxurious or careless, who are keen to
avoid backsliding, leaders in seclusion, energetic, resolute,
established in mindfulness, fully aware, concentrated, with unified
minds, possessing wisdom, not drivellers. Master Gotama dwells
together with these.</P>
<P  >16
“Just as black orris root is reckoned as the best of root perfumes
and red sandalwood is reckoned as the best of wood perfumes and
jasmine is reckoned as the best of flower perfumes, [7] so too,
Master Gotama’s advice is supreme among the teachings of today.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1030anc" HREF="#sdendnote1030sym"><SUP>mxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >17.
“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overturned, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master
Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge
for life.”</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading109"  >
108. Gopakamoggallana Sutta - With Gopaka Moggallana</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Ananda was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary, not long
after the Blessed One had attained to final Nibbana.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1031anc" HREF="#sdendnote1031sym"><SUP>mxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha, being
suspicious of King Pajjota, was having Rajagaha fortified.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1032anc" HREF="#sdendnote1032sym"><SUP>mxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Ananda dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, went into Rajagaha for alms. Then the
venerable Ananda thought: “It is still too early to wander for alms
in Rajagaha. Suppose I went to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana at his
workplace.”</P>
<P  >4.
So the venerable Ananda went to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana at his
workplace. The brahmin Gopaka Moggallana saw the venerable Ananda
coming in the distance and said to him: “Let Master Ananda come!
Welcome to Master Ananda! It is long since Master Ananda found an
opportunity to come here. Let Master Ananda be seated; this seat is
ready.” The venerable Ananda sat down on the seat made ready. [8]
The brahmin Gopaka Moggallana took a low seat, sat down at one side,
and asked the venerable Ananda:</P>
<P  >5.
“Master Ananda, is there any single bhikkhu who possesses in each
and every way all those qualities that were possessed by Master
Gotama, accomplished and fully enlightened?”</P>
<P  >“There
is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who possesses in each and every way
all those qualities that were possessed by the Blessed One,
accomplished and fully enlightened. For the Blessed One was the
arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of the unproduced path,
the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the knower of the path,
the finder of the path, the one skilled in the path. But his
disciples now abide following that path and become possessed of it
afterwards.”</P>
<P  >6.
But this discussion between the venerable Ananda and the brahmin
Gopaka Moggallana was interrupted; for then the brahmin Vassakara,
the minister of Magadha,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1033anc" HREF="#sdendnote1033sym"><SUP>mxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
while supervising the work at Rajagaha, went to the venerable Ananda
at the workplace of the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana. He exchanged
greetings with. the venerable Ananda, and when this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and asked the
venerable Ananda: “For what discussion are you sitting together
here now, Master Ananda? And what was your discussion that was
interrupted?”</P>
<P  >“Brahmin,
the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana asked me: ‘Master Ananda, is there
any single bhikkhu who possesses in each and every way all those
qualities that were possessed by Master Gotama, accomplished and
fully enlightened?’ I replied to the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana:
‘There is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who possesses in each and
every way all those qualities that were possessed by the Blessed One,
accomplished and fully enlightened. For the Blessed One was the
arouser of the unarisen path [9] … But his disciples now abide
following that path and become possessed of it afterwards.’ This
was our discussion that was interrupted when you arrived.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Is there, Master Ananda, any single bhikkhu who was appointed by
Master Gotama thus: ‘He will be your refuge when I am gone,’ and
whom you now have recourse to?”</P>
<P  >“There
is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who was appointed by the Blessed One
who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, thus: ‘He
will be your refuge when I am gone,’ and whom we now have recourse
to.”</P>
<P  >8.
“But is there, Master Ananda, any single bhikkhu who has been
chosen by the Sangha and appointed by a number of elder bhikkhus
thus: ‘He will be our refuge after the Blessed One has gone,’ and
whom you now have recourse to?”</P>
<P  >“There
is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who has been chosen by the Sangha and
appointed by a number of elder bhikkhus thus: ‘He will be our
refuge after the Blessed One has gone,’ and whom we now have
recourse to.”</P>
<P  >9.
“But if you have no refuge, Master Ananda, what is the cause for
your concord?”</P>
<P  >“We
are not without a refuge, brahmin. We have a refuge; we have the
Dhamma as our refuge.”</P>
<P  >10.
“But when you were asked: ‘Is there, Master Ananda, any single
bhikkhu who was appointed by Master Gotama thus: “He will be your
refuge when I am gone,” and whom you now have recourse to?’ you
answered: ‘There is no such single bhikkhu … whom we now have
recourse to.’ When you were asked: ‘Is there, Master Ananda, any
single bhikkhu who has been chosen by the Sangha and appointed by a
number of elder bhikkhus thus: “He will be our refuge after the
Blessed One has gone,” and whom you now have recourse to?’ you
answered: ‘There is no such single bhikkhu … [10] … whom we now
have recourse to.’ When you were asked: ‘But if you have no
refuge, Master Ananda, what is the cause for your concord?’ you
answered: ‘We are not without a refuge, brahmin. We have a refuge;
we have the Dhamma as our refuge.’ Now how should the meaning of
these statements be regarded, Master Ananda?”</P>
<P  >“Brahmin,
the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully
enlightened, has prescribed the course of training for bhikkhus and
he has laid down the Patimokkha. On the Uposatha day as many of us as
live in dependence upon a single village district meet together in
unison, and when we meet we ask one who knows the Patimokkha to
recite it. If a bhikkhu remembers an offence or a transgression while
the Patimokkha is being recited, we deal with him according to the
Dhamma in the way we have been instructed. It is not the worthy ones
who deal with us; it is the Dhamma that deals with us.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1034anc" HREF="#sdendnote1034sym"><SUP>mxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
“Is there, Master Ananda, any single bhikkhu whom you now honour,
respect, revere, and venerate, and on whom you live in dependence
honouring and respecting him?”</P>
<P  >“There
is a single bhikkhu, brahmin, whom we now honour, respect, revere,
and venerate, and on whom we live in dependence honouring and
respecting him.”</P>
<P  >12.
“But when you were asked: ‘Is there, Master Ananda, any single
bhikkhu who was appointed by Master Gotama … ?’ you answered
‘There is no such single bhikkhu … ’ When you were asked: ‘Is
there, Master Ananda, any single bhikkhu who has been chosen by the
Sangha … ?’ [11] you answered: ‘There is no such single bhikkhu
… ’ When you were asked: ‘Is there, Master Ananda, any single
bhikkhu whom you honour, respect, revere,</P>
<P  >and
venerate, and on whom you live in dependence honouring and respecting

honour … and on whom we live in dependence honouring and respecting
him.’ Now how should the meaning of these statements be regarded,
Master Ananda?”</P>
<P  >13.
“There are, brahmin, ten qualities inspiring confidence that have
been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and
fully enlightened. When these qualities are found in anyone among us,
we honour, respect, revere, and venerate him, and live in dependence
on him honouring and respecting him. What are the ten?</P>
<P  >14.
(1) “Here, brahmin, a bhikkhu is virtuous, he dwells restrained
with the restraint of the Patimokkha, he is perfect in conduct and
resort, and seeing fear in the slightest faults, he trains himself by
undertaking the training precepts.</P>
<P  >15.
(2) “He has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and
consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as are good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right
meaning and phrasing, and which affirm a holy life that is utterly
perfect and pure - such teachings as these he has learned much of,
remembered, mastered verbally, investigated with the mind, and
penetrated well by view.</P>
<P  >16.
(3) “He is content with his robes, almsfood, resting place, and
medicinal requisites.</P>
<P  >17.
(4) “He obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four
jhanas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding
here and now.</P>
<P  >18.
(5) “He wields the various kinds of supernormal power: having been
one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears
and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an
enclosure, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in
and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water
without sinking as though it were earth; [12] seated cross-legged, he
travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes
the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he wields bodily mastery
even as far as the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >19.
(6) “With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses
the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human,
those that are far as well as near.</P>
<P  >20.
(7) “He understands the minds of other beings, of other persons,
having encompassed them with his own mind. He understands a mind
affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as
unaffected by lust; he understands a mind affected by hate as
affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate;
he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion
and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; he
understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as
distracted; he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an
unexalted mind as unexalted; he understands a surpassed mind as
surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; he understands a
concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as
unconcentrated; he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an
unliberated mind as unliberated.</P>
<P  >21.
(8) “He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two
births … (as Sutta 51, §24) … Thus with their aspects and
particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >22.
(9) “With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the
human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and
superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he
understands how beings pass on according to their actions.</P>
<P  >23.
(10) “By realising for himself with direct knowledge, he here and
now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance
by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints.</P>
<P  >“These,
brahmin, are the ten qualities inspiring confidence that have been
declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and
fully enlightened. When these qualities are found in anyone among us,
we honour, respect, revere, and venerate him, and live in dependence
on him honouring and respecting him.” [13]</P>
<P  >24.
When this was said, the brahmin Vassakara, the minister of Magadha,
said to General Upananda: “What do you think, general? When these
worthy ones honour one who should be honoured, respect one who should
be respected, revere one who should be revered, and venerate one who
should be venerated, surely they honour one who should be honoured …
and venerate one who should be venerated. For if these worthy ones
did not honour, respect, revere, and venerate such. a person, then
whom</P>
<P  >could
they honour, respect, revere, and venerate, and on whom could they
live in dependence honouring and respecting?”</P>
<P  >25.
Then the brahmin Vassakara, the minister of Magadha, said to the
venerable Ananda: “Where is Master Ananda living now?”</P>
<P  >“Now
I am living in the Bamboo Grove, brahmin.”</P>
<P  >“I
hope, Master Ananda, that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant, quiet and
undisturbed by voices, with an atmosphere of seclusion, remote from
people, favourable for retreat.”</P>
<P  >“Indeed,
brahmin, that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant … favourable for retreat
is because of such guardian protectors as yourself.”</P>
<P  >“Indeed,
Master Ananda, that the Bamboo Grove is pleasant … favourable for
retreat is because of the worthy ones who are meditators and
cultivate meditation. The worthy ones are meditators and cultivate
meditation. On one occasion, Master Ananda, Master Gotama was living
at Vesa]i in the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great Wood. Then I
went there and approached Master Gotama, and in many ways he gave a
talk about meditation. Master Gotama was a meditator and cultivated
meditation, and he praised every type of meditation.”</P>
<P  >26.
“The Blessed One, brahmin, did not praise every type of meditation,
nor did he condemn every type of meditation. What kind [14] of
meditation did the Blessed One not praise? Here, brahmin, someone
abides with his mind obsessed by sensual lust, a prey to sensual
lust, and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from
arisen sensual lust. While he harbours sensual lust within, he
meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1035anc" HREF="#sdendnote1035sym"><SUP>mxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
He abides with his mind obsessed by ill will, a prey to ill will …
with his mind obsessed by sloth and torpor, a prey to sloth and
torpor … with his mind obsessed by restlessness and remorse, a prey
to restlessness and remorse … with his mind obsessed by doubt, a
prey to doubt, and he does not understand as it actually is the
escape from arisen doubt. While he harbours doubt within, he
meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates. The Blessed
One did not praise that kind of meditation.</P>
<P  >27.
“And what kind of meditation did the Blessed One praise? Here,
brahmin, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana … With the stilling of applied and sustained</P>
<P  >thought,
he enters upon and abides in the second jhana … With the fading
away as well of rapture … he enters upon and abides in the third
jhana … With the abandoning of pleasure and pain … he enters upon
and abides in the fourth jhana … The Blessed One praised that kind
of meditation.”</P>
<P  >28.
“It seems, Master Ananda, that Master Gotama censured that kind of
meditation that should be censured and praised that kind of
meditation that should be praised. And now, Master Ananda, we depart.
We are busy and have much to do.”</P>
<P  >“Now
is the time, brahmin, to do as you think fit.” [15]</P>
<P  >Then
the brahmin Vassakara, the minister of Magadha, having delighted and
rejoiced in the venerable Ananda’s words, rose from his seat and
departed.</P>
<P  >29.
Then, soon after he had left, the brahmin Gopaka Moggallana said to
the venerable Ananda: “Master Ananda has not yet answered what we
asked him.”</P>
<P  >“Did
we not tell you, brahmin: ‘There is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who
possesses in each and every way all those qualities that were
possessed by the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened. For
the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of
the unproduced path, the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the
knower of the path, the finder of the path, the one skilled in the
path. But his disciples now abide following that path and become
possessed of it afterwards’?”</P>

109. Mahapunnama Sutta - The Greater Discourse on the Full-moon Night</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara’s Mother.</P>
<P  >2.
On that occasion - on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1036anc" HREF="#sdendnote1036sym"><SUP>mxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
on the full-moon night - the Blessed One was seated in the open
surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >3.
Then a certain bhikkhu rose from his seat,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1037anc" HREF="#sdendnote1037sym"><SUP>mxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands in
reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, said to him:
“Venerable sir, I would ask the Blessed One about a certain point,
if the Blessed One would grant me an answer to my question.” - “Sit
on your own seat, bhikkhu, and ask what you like.” So the bhikkhu
sat on his own seat and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >4.
“Are these not, venerable sir, the five aggregates affected by
clinging; [16] that is, the material form aggregate affected by
clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the perception
aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate affected by
clinging, and the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging?”</P>
<P  >“These,
bhikkhus, are the five aggregates affected by clinging; that is, the
material form aggregate affected by clinging … and the
consciousness aggregate affected by clinging.”</P>
<P  >Saying,
“Good, venerable sir,” the bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One’s words. Then he asked him a further question:</P>
<P  >5.
“But, venerable sir, in what are these five aggregates affected by
clinging rooted?”</P>
<P  >“These
five aggregates affected by clinging are rooted in desire,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1038anc" HREF="#sdendnote1038sym"><SUP>mxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
bhikkhu.”</P>
<P  >6.
“Venerable sir, is that clinging the same as these five aggregates
affected by clinging, or is the clinging something apart from the
five aggregates affected by clinging?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1039anc" HREF="#sdendnote1039sym"><SUP>mxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
that clinging is neither the same as these five aggregates affected
by clinging, nor is the clinging something apart from the five
aggregates affected by clinging. It is the desire and lust in regard
to the five aggregates affected by clinging that is the clinging
there.”</P>
<P  >7.
“But, venerable sir, can there be diversity in the desire and lust
regarding these five aggregates affected by clinging?”</P>
<P  >“There
can be, bhikkhu,” the Blessed One said. “Here, bhikkhu, someone
thinks thus: ‘May my material form be thus in the future; may my
feeling be thus in the future; may my perception be thus in the
future; may my formations be thus in the future; may my consciousness
be thus in the future.’ Thus there is diversity in the desire and
lust regarding these five aggregates affected by clinging.”</P>
<P  >8.
“But, venerable sir, in what way does the term ‘aggregates’
apply to the aggregates?”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
any kind of material form whatever, whether past, future, or present,
internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or
near - this is the material form aggregate. [17] Any kind of feeling
whatever … far or near - this is the feeling aggregate. Any kind of
perception whatever … far or near - this is the perception
aggregate. Any kind of formations whatever … far or near - this is
the formations aggregate. Any kind of consciousness whatever … far
or near - this is the consciousness aggregate. It is in this way,
bhikkhu, that the term ‘aggregate’ applies to the aggregates.”</P>
<P  >9.
“What is the cause and condition, venerable sir, for the
manifestation of the material form aggregate? What is the cause and
condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate … the
perception aggregate … the formations aggregate … the
consciousness aggregate?”</P>
<P  >“The
four great elements, bhikkhu, are the cause and condition for the
manifestation of the material form aggregate. Contact is the cause
and condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate. Contact
is the cause and the condition for the manifestation of the
perception aggregate. Contact is the cause and condition for the
manifestation of the formations aggregate. Mentality-materiality is
the cause and condition for the manifestation of the consciousness
aggregate.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1040anc" HREF="#sdendnote1040sym"><SUP>mxl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >10.
“Venerable sir, how does personality view come to be?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1041anc" HREF="#sdendnote1041sym"><SUP>mxli</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhu, an untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for noble
ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no
regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their
Dhamma, regards material form as self, or self as possessed of
material form, or material form as in self, or self as in material
form. He regards feeling as self … perception as self …
formations as self … consciousness as self, or self as possessed of
consciousness, [18] or consciousness as in self, or self as in
consciousness. That is how personality view comes to be.”</P>
<P  >11.
“But, venerable sir, how does personality view not come to be?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
bhikkhu, a well-taught noble disciple, who has regard for noble ones
and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for
true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not
regard material form as self, or self as possessed of material form,
or material form as in self, or self as in material form. He does not
regard feeling as self.. perception as self … formations as self …
consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or
consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how
personality view does not come to be.”</P>
<P  >12.
“What, venerable sir, is the gratification, what is the danger, and
what is the escape in the case of material form? What is the
gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case
of feeling … in the case of perception … in the case of
formations … in the case of consciousness?”</P>
<P  >“The
pleasure and joy, bhikkhu, that arise in dependence on material form
- this is the gratification in the case of material form. Material
form is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change - this is the
danger in the case of material form. The removal of desire and lust,
the abandonment of desire and lust for material form - this is the
escape in the case of material form.</P>
<P  >“The
pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on feeling … in
dependence on perception … in dependence on formations … in
dependence on consciousness - this is the gratification in the case
of consciousness. Consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and.
subject to change - this is the danger in the case of consciousness.
The removal of desire and lust, the abandonment of desire and lust
for consciousness - this is the escape in the case of consciousness.”</P>
<P  >13.
“Venerable sir, how does one know, how does one see, so that in
regard to this body with its consciousness and all external signs,
there is no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to
conceit?”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
any kind of material form whatever, whether past or present, internal
or external, gross or subtle, inferior [19] or superior, far or near
- one sees all material form as it actually is with proper wisdom
thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Any
kind of feeling whatever … Any kind of perception whatever … Any
kind of formations whatever … Any kind of consciousness whatever …
one sees all consciousness as it actually is with proper wisdom thus:
‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ It is
when one knows and sees thus that in regard to this body with its
consciousness and all external signs there is no I-making,
mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit.”</P>
<P  >14.
Then, in the mind of a certain bhikkhu this thought arose: “So, it
seems, material form is not self, feeling is not self, perception is
not self, formations are not self, consciousness is not self. What
self, then, will actions done by the not-self affect?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1042anc" HREF="#sdendnote1042sym"><SUP>mxlii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One, knowing in his mind the thought in the mind of that
bhikkhu, addressed the bhikkhus thus: “It is possible, bhikkhus,
that some misguided man here, obtuse and ignorant, with his mind
dominated by craving, might think that he can outstrip the Teacher’s
Dispensation thus: ‘So, it seems, material form is not self …
consciousness is not self. What self, then, will actions done by the
not-self affect?’ Now, bhikkhus, you have been trained by me
through interrogation on various occasions in regard to various
things.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1043anc" HREF="#sdendnote1043sym"><SUP>mxliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
“Bhikkhus, what do you think? Is material form permanent or
impermanent?” - “Impermanent, venerable sir.” - “Is what is
impermanent suffering or happiness?” - “Suffering, venerable
sir.” - “Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change
fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my
self’?” - “No, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhus,
what do you think: Is feeling … perception … formations …
consciousness permanent or impermanent?” - “Impermanent,
venerable sir.” - [20] “Is what is impermanent suffering</P>
<P  >or
happiness?” - “Suffering, venerable sir.” - “Is what is
impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded
thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?” - “No,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >16.
“Therefore, bhikkhus, any kind of material form whatever, whether
past, future, or present … all material form should be seen as it
actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am
not, this is not my self.’ Any kind of feeling whatever … Any
kind of perception whatever … Any kind of formations whatever …
Any kind of consciousness whatever … all consciousness should be
seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine,
this I am not, this is not my self.’</P>
<P  >17.
“Seeing thus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes disenchanted
with material form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with
perception, disenchanted with formations, disenchanted with
consciousness.</P>
<P  >18.
“Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion
[his mind] is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the
knowledge: ‘It is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is
destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been
done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words. Now while this discourse was
being spoken, through not clinging the minds of sixty bhikkhus were
liberated from the taints.<SUP> <A  NAME="sdendnote1044anc" HREF="#sdendnote1044sym"><SUP>mxliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

110. Culapunnama Sutta - The Shorter Discourse on the Full-moon Night</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara’s Mother.</P>
<P  >2.
On that occasion - the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, on the
full-moon night - [21] the Blessed One was seated in the open
surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, surveying the silent
Sangha of bhikkhus, he addressed them thus:</P>
<P  >3.
“Bhikkhus, would an untrue man<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1045anc" HREF="#sdendnote1045sym"><SUP>mxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
know of an untrue man: ‘This person is an untrue man’?’’ -
“No, venerable sir.” - “Good, bhikkhus. It is impossible, it
cannot be, that an untrue man should know of an untrue man: ‘This
person is an untrue man.’ But would an untrue man know of a true
man: ‘This person is a true man’?” - “No, venerable sir.” -
“Good, bhikkhus. It is impossible, it cannot be, that an untrue man
should know of a true man: ‘This person is a true man.’</P>
<P  >4.
“Bhikkhus, an untrue man is possessed of bad qualities; he
associates as an untrue man, he wills as an untrue man, he counsels
as an untrue man, he speaks as an untrue man, he acts as an untrue
man, he holds views as an untrue man, and he gives gifts as an untrue
man.</P>
<P  >5.
“And how is an untrue man possessed of bad qualities? Here an
untrue man has no faith, no shame, no fear of wrongdoing; he is
unlearned, lazy, forgetful, and unwise. That is how an untrue man is
possessed of bad qualities.</P>
<P  >6.
“And how does an untrue man associate as an untrue man? Here an
untrue man has for friends and companions those recluses and brahmins
who have no faith, no shame, no fear of wrongdoing; who are
unlearned, lazy, forgetful, and unwise. That is how an untrue man
associates as an untrue man.</P>
<P  >7.
“And how does an untrue man will as an untrue man? Here an untrue
man wills for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and
for the affliction of both. That is how an untrue man wills as an
untrue man.</P>
<P  >8.
“And how does an untrue man counsel as an untrue man? Here an
untrue man counsels for his own affliction, for the affliction of
others, and for the affliction of both. [22] That is how an untrue
man counsels as an untrue man.</P>
<P  >9.
“And how does an untrue man speak as an untrue man? Here an untrue
man speaks false speech, malicious speech, harsh speech, and gossip.
That is how an untrue man speaks as an untrue man.</P>
<P  >10.
“And how does an untrue man act as an untrue man? Here an untrue
man kills living beings, takes what is not given, and misconducts
himself in sensual pleasures. That is how an untrue man acts as an
untrue man.</P>
<P  >11.
“And how does an untrue man hold views as an untrue man? Here an
untrue man holds such a view as this: ‘There is nothing given,
nothing offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and
bad actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no
beings who are reborn spontaneously; no good and virtuous recluses
and brahmins in the world who have realised for themselves by direct
knowledge and declare this world and the other world.’ That is how
an untrue man holds views as an untrue man.</P>
<P  >12.
“And how does an untrue man give gifts as an untrue man? Here an
untrue man gives a gift carelessly, gives it not with his own hand,
gives it without showing respect, gives what is to be discarded,
gives it with the view that nothing will come of it. That is how an
untrue man gives gifts as an untrue man.</P>
<P  >13.
“That untrue man - thus possessed of bad qualities, who thus
associates as an untrue man, wills as an untrue man, counsels as an
untrue man, speaks as an untrue man, acts as an untrue man, holds
views as an untrue man, and gives gifts as an untrue man - on the
dissolution of the body, after death, reappears in the destination of
untrue men. And what is the destination of untrue men? It is hell or
the animal world.</P>
<P  >14.
“Bhikkhus, would a true man know of a true man: ‘This person is a
true man’?” [23] - “Yes, venerable sir.” - “Good, bhikkhus.
It is possible that a true man would know of a true man: ‘This
person is a true man.’ But would a true man know of an untrue man:
‘This person is an untrue man’T’ - “Yes, venerable sir.” -
“Good, bhikkhus. It is possible that a true man would know of an
untrue man: ‘This person is an untrue man.’</P>
<P  >15.
“Bhikkhus, a true man is possessed of good qualities; he associates
as a true man, he wills as a true man, he counsels as a true man, he
speaks as a true man, he acts as a true man, he holds views as a true
man, and he gives gifts as a true man.</P>
<P  >16.
“And how is a true man possessed of good qualities? Here a true man
has faith, shame, and fear of wrongdoing; he is learned, energetic,
mindful, and wise. That is how a true man is possessed of good
qualities.</P>
<P  >17.
“And how does a true man associate as a true man? Here a true man
has for his friends and companions those recluses and brahmins who
have faith, shame, and fear of wrongdoing; who are learned,
energetic, mindful, and wise. That is how a true man associates as a
true man.</P>
<P  >18.
“And how does a true man will as a true man? Here a true man does
not will for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, or for
the affliction of both. That is how a true man wills as a true man.</P>
<P  >19.
“And how does a true man counsel as a true man? Here a true man
does not counsel for his own affliction, for the affliction of
others, or for the affliction of both. That is how a true man
counsels as a true man.</P>
<P  >20.
“And how does a true man speak as a true man? Here a true man
abstains from false speech, from malicious speech, from harsh speech,
and from gossip. That is how a true man speaks as a true man.</P>
<P  >21.
“And how does a true man act as a true man? Here a true man
abstains from killing living beings, from taking what is not given,
[24] and from misconduct in sensual pleasures. That is how a true man
acts as a true man.</P>
<P  >22.
“And how does a true man hold views as a true man? Here a true man
holds such a view as this: ‘There is what is given and what is
offered and what is sacrificed; there is fruit and result of good and
bad actions; there is this world and the other world; there is mother
and father; there are beings who are reborn spontaneously; there are
good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have
realised for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world
and the other world.’ That is how a true man holds views as a true
man.</P>
<P  >23.
“And how does a true man give gifts as a true man? Here a true man
gives a gift carefully, gives it with his own hand, gives it showing
respect, gives a valuable gift, gives it with the view that something
will come of it. That is how a true man gives gifts as a true man.</P>
<P  >24.
“That true man - thus possessed of good qualities, who thus
associates as a true man, wills as a true man, counsels as a true
man, speaks as a true man, acts as a true man, holds views as a true
man, and gives gifts as a true man - on the dissolution of the body,
after death, reappears in the destination of true men. And what is
the destination of true men? It is greatness among the gods or
greatness among human beings.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

111. Anupada Sutta - One by One As They Occurred</H2>
<P  >[2511.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable, sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, Sariputta is wise; Sariputta has great wisdom; Sariputta
has wide wisdom; Sariputta has joyous wisdom; Sariputta has quick
wisdom; Sariputta has keen wisdom; Sariputta has penetrative wisdom.
During half a month, bhikkhus, Sariputta had insight into states one
by one as they occurred.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1046anc" HREF="#sdendnote1046sym"><SUP>mxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Now Sariputta’s insight into states one by one as they occurred was
this:</P>
<P  >3.
“Here, bhikkhus, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unwholesome states, Sariputta entered upon and abided in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</P>
<P  >4.
“And the states in the first jhana - the applied thought, the
sustained thought, the rapture, the pleasure, and the unification of
mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal,
decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention - these
states were defined by him one by one as they occurred;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1047anc" HREF="#sdendnote1047sym"><SUP>mxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
known to him those states arose, known they were present, known they
disappeared. He understood thus: ‘So indeed, these states, not
having been, come into being; having been, they vanish.’ Regarding
those states, he abided unattracted, unrepelled, independent,
detached, free, dissociated, with a mind rid of barriers.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1048anc" HREF="#sdendnote1048sym"><SUP>mxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond,’ and with the
cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed that there is.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1049anc" HREF="#sdendnote1049sym"><SUP>mxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought, Sariputta entered and abided in [26] the second jhana, which
has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.</P>
<P  >6.
“And the states in the second jhana - the self-confidence, the
rapture, the pleasure, and the unification of mind; the contact,
feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy,
mindfulness, equanimity, and attention - these states were defined by
him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose,
known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus:
… and with the cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed that
there is.</P>
<P  >7.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the fading away as well of rapture,
Sariputta abided in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still
feeling pleasure with the body, he entered upon and abided in the
third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a
pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’</P>
<P  >8.
“And the states in the third jhana - the equanimity, the pleasure,
the mindfulness, the full awareness, and the unification of mind; the
contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision,
energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention - these states were
defined by him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states
arose, known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood
thus: … and with the cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed
that there is.</P>
<P  >9.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and
with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, Sariputta entered
upon and abided in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity.</P>

formerly when I lived the home life I was ignorant. Then the
Tathagata or his disciple taught me the Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma
I acquired faith in the Tathagata. Possessing that faith, I
considered thus: “Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone
forth is wide open. It is not easy while living in a home to lead the
holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I
shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth
from the home life into homelessness.” On a later occasion,
abandoning a small or a large fortune, abandoning a small or a large
circle of relations, I shaved off my hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness.</P>

the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, I entered upon and abided in the

pleasure and pain … I entered upon and abided in the fourth jhana,
which has neither-painnor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity.</P>

“‘Bhikkhus, bodily conduct is of two kinds, I say: to be

wholesome states to diminish in one who cultivates it should not be
cultivated. But such bodily conduct as causes unwholesome states to
diminish and wholesome states to increase in one who cultivates it
should be cultivated.</P>
<P  >“And
what kind of bodily conduct causes unwholesome states to increase and
wholesome states to diminish in one who cultivates it? Here someone
kills living beings; he is murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows
and violence, merciless to living beings. He takes what is not given;
he takes by way of theft the wealth and property of others in the
village or in the forest. He misconducts himself in sensual
pleasures; he has intercourse with such women as are protected by
their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or
relatives, who have a husband, who are protected by law, and even
with those who are garlanded in token of betrothal. Such bodily
conduct [47] causes unwholesome states to increase and wholesome
states to diminish in one who cultivates it.</P>
<P  >“And
what kind of bodily conduct causes unwholesome states to diminish and
wholesome states to increase in one who cultivates it? Here someone,
abandoning the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living
beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gently and kindly, he abides
compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is
not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; he does not
take by way of theft the wealth and property of others in the village
or in the forest. Abandoning misconduct in sensual pleasures, he
abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasures; he does not have
intercourse with such women as are protected by their mother, father,

who are protected by law, or with those who are garlanded in token of

some trifling worldly end. He speaks maliciously; he repeats
elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those people]
from these, or he repeats to these people what he has heard elsewhere
in order to divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who
divides those who are united, a creator of divisions, who enjoys
discord, rejoices in discord, delights in discord, a speaker of words
that create discord. He speaks harshly; he utters such words as are
rough, hard, hurtful to others, offensive to others, bordering on
anger, unconducive to concentration. He is a gossip; he speaks at the
wrong time, speaks what is not fact, speaks what is useless, speaks
contrary to the Dhamma and the Discipline; at the wrong time he
speaks such words as are worthless, unreasonable, immoderate, and
unbeneficial. Such verbal conduct causes unwholesome states to

THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at

“Bhikkhus, whatever fears arise, all arise because of the fool, not
because of the wise man; whatever troubles arise, all arise because
of the fool, not because of the wise man; whatever calamities arise,
all arise because of the fool, not because of the wise man. Just as a
fire that starts in a shed made of rushes or grass burns down even a
house with a peaked roof, with walls plastered inside and outside,
shut off, secured by bars, with shuttered windows; so too, bhikkhus,
whatever fears arise … all arise because of the fool, not because
of the wise man. Thus the fool brings fear, the wise man brings no
fear; the fool brings trouble, the wise man brings no trouble; the
fool brings calamity, the wise man brings no calamity. No fear comes
from the wise man, no trouble comes from the wise man, no calamity
comes from the wise man. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train thus:
‘We shall be wise men, we shall be inquirers.’“[62]</P>

THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara’s Mother,
together with many very well-known elder disciples - the venerable
Sariputta, the venerable Maha Moggallana, the venerable Maha Kassapa,
the venerable Maha Kaccana, the venerable Maha Kotthita, the
venerable Maha Kappina, the venerable Maha Cunda, [79] the venerable
Anuruddha, the venerable Revata, the venerable Ananda, and other very
well-known elder disciples.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing
new bhikkhus; some elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing
ten new bhikkhus, some elder bhikkhus had been teaching and
instructing twenty … thirty … forty new bhikkhus. And the new
bhikkhus, taught and instructed by the elder bhikkhus, had achieved
successive stages of high distinction.</P>
<P  >3.
On that occasion - the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, on the
full-moon night of the Pavarana ceremony<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1115anc" HREF="#sdendnote1115sym"><SUP>mcxv</SUP></A></SUP>
- the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of
bhikkhus. Then, surveying the silent Sangha of bhikkhus, he addressed
them thus:</P>
<P  >4.
“Bhikkhus, I am content with this progress. My mind is content with
this progress. So arouse still more energy to attain the unattained,
to achieve the unachieved, to realise the unrealised. I shall wait

The bhikkhus of the countryside heard: “The Blessed One will wait
there at Savatthi for the Komudi full moon of then fourth month.”
And the bhikkhus of the countryside left in due course for Savatthi
to see the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >6.
And elder bhikkhus still more intensively taught and instructed new
bhikkhus; some elder bhikkhus taught and instructed ten new bhikkhus,
some elder bhikkhus taught and instructed twenty … thirty … forty
new bhikkhus. And the new bhikkhus, taught and instructed by the
elder bhikkhus, [80] achieved successive stages of high distinction.</P>

On that occasion - the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon
night of the Komudi full moon of the fourth month - the Blessed One
was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then,
surveying the silent Sangha of bhikkhus, he addressed them thus:</P>

free from chatter. It consists purely of heartwood. Such is this

abandoned … That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the
body.</P>
<H3 >(FOULNESS - THE BODILY PARTS)</H3>
<P  >7.
“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the
soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair, bounded by skin,
as full of many kinds of impurity thus: ‘In this body there are
head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones,
bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, large
intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach, feces, bile,
phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of
the joints, and urine.’ Just as though there were a bag with an
opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain, such as hill rice,
red rice, beans, peas, millet, and white rice, and a man with good
eyes were to open it and review it thus: ‘This is hill rice, this
is red rice, these are beans, these are peas, this is millet, this is
white rice’; so too, a bhikkhu reviews this same body as full of
many kinds of impurity thus: ‘In this body there are head-hairs …
and urine.’ As he abides thus diligent, ardent, and resolute, his
memories and intentions based on the household life are abandoned …
That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body. [91]</P>
<H3 >(ELEMENTS)</H3>
<P  >8.
“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body, however it is
placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus: ‘In this
body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire
element, and the air element.’ Just as though a skilled butcher or
his apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads
with it cut up into pieces; so too, a bhikkhu reviews this same body
however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements
thus: ‘In this body there are the earth element, the water element,
the fire element, and the air element.’ As he abides thus diligent,
ardent, and resolute, his memories and intentions connected with the
household life are abandoned … That too is how a bhikkhu develops
mindfulness of the body.</P>
<H3 >THE NINE CHARNEL GROUND CONTEMPLATIONS)</H3>
<P  >9.
“Again, bhikkhus, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in
a charnel ground, one, two, or three days dead, bloated, livid, and
oozing matter, a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus: ‘This
body too is of the same nature, it will be like that, it is not
exempt from that fate.’ As he abides thus diligent … That too is
how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body.</P>
<P  >10.
“Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel
ground, being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, or
various kinds of worms, a bhikkhu compares this same body with it
thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it will be like that,
it is not exempt from that fate.’ As he abides thus diligent …
That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body. [92]</P>
<P  >11-14.
“Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel
ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinews …
a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews …
a skeleton without flesh and blood, held together with sinews …
disconnected bones scattered in all directions - here a hand-bone,
there a foot-bone, here a shinbone, there a thigh-bone, here a
hip-bone, there a back-bone, here a rib-bone, there a breast-bone,
here an arm-bone, there a shoulder-bone, here a neck-bone, there a
jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull - a bhikkhu compares this
same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it
will be like that, it is not exempt from that fate.’ As he abides
thus diligent … That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of
the body.</P>
<P  >15-17.
“Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel
ground, bones bleached white, the colour of shells … bones heaped
up, more than a year old … bones rotted and crumbled to dust, a
bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of
the same nature, it will be like that, it is not exempt from that
fate.’ As he abides thus diligent … That too is how a bhikkhu
develops mindfulness of the body.</P>
<H3 >(THE JHANAS)</H3>
<P  >18.
“Again, bhikkhus, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</P>
<P  >He
makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench, steep, fill,
and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. Just as a
skilled bath man or a bath man’s apprentice<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1130anc" HREF="#sdendnote1130sym"><SUP>mcxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
heaps bath powder in a metal basin and, sprinkling it gradually with
water, kneads it till the moisture wets his ball of bath powder,
soaks it and pervades it inside and out, yet the ball itself does not
ooze; so too, a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion [93] drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that
there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion. As he abides thus diligent … That too
is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body.</P>
<P  >19.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which
has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.
He makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench,
steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his
whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of
concentration. Just as though there were a lake whose waters welled
up from below and it had no inflow from east, west, north, or south,
and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain,
then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the
cool water drench, steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that there
would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water; so too,
a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of
concentration. As he abides thus diligent … That too is how a
bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body.</P>
<P  >20.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the fading away as well of rapture, a
bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still
feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the
third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a
pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’ He makes the
pleasure divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this
body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the
pleasure divested of rapture. Just as in a pond of blue or white or
red lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive
immersed in the water without rising out of it, [94] and cool water
drenches, steeps, fills, and pervades them to their tips and their
roots, so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by
cool water; so too, a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapture. As
he abides thus diligent … That too is how a bhikkhu develops
mindfulness of the body.</P>
<P  >21.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and
with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity. He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so
that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright
mind. Just as though a man were sitting covered from head down with a
white cloth, so that there would be no part of his whole body not
covered by the white cloth; so too, a bhikkhu sits pervading this
body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his body
unpervaded by the pure bright mind. As he abides thus diligent,
ardent, and resolute, his memories and intentions based on the
household life are abandoned; with their abandoning his mind becomes
steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated. That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the
body.</P>

121. Culasunnata Sutta - The Shorter Discourse on Voidness</H2>
<P  >[104]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi. in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara’s Mother.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Ananda rose from meditation,
went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down
at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >3.
“Venerable sir, on one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Sakyan country at a town of the Sakyans named Nagaraka. There,
venerable sir, I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own
lips: ‘Now, Ananda, I often abide in voidness.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1137anc" HREF="#sdendnote1137sym"><SUP>mcxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Did I hear that correctly, venerable sir, did I learn that correctly,
attend to that correctly, remember that correctly?”</P>
<P  >“Certainly,
Ananda, you heard that correctly, learned that correctly, attended to
that correctly, remembered that correctly. As formerly, Ananda, so
now too I often abide in voidness.</P>
<P  >4.
“Ananda, just as this Palace of Migara’s Mother is void of
elephants, cattle, horses, and mares, void of gold and silver, void
of the assembly of men and women, and there is present only this
non-voidness, namely, the singleness dependent on the Sangha of
bhikkhus; so too, a bhikkhu - not attending to the perception of
village, not attending to the perception of people - attends to the
singleness dependent on the perception of forest.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1138anc" HREF="#sdendnote1138sym"><SUP>mcxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
His mind enters into that perception of forest and acquires
confidence, steadiness, and decision. He understands thus: ‘Whatever
disturbances there might be dependent on the perception of village,
those are not present here; whatever disturbances there might be
dependent on the perception of people, those are not present here.
There is present only this amount of disturbance, namely, the
singleness dependent on the perception of forest.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1139anc" HREF="#sdendnote1139sym"><SUP>mcxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
He understands: ‘This field of perception is void of the perception
of village; this field of perception is void of the perception of
people. There is present only this non-voidness, namely, the
singleness dependent on the perception of forest.’ Thus he regards
it as void of what is not there, but as to what [105] remains there
he understands that which is present thus: ‘This is present.’
Thus, Ananda, this is his genuine, undistorted, pure descent into
voidness.</P>
<P  >5.

For he is able to know about the Buddhas of the past - who attained
to final Nibbana, cut [the tangle of] proliferation, broke the cycle,
ended the round, and surmounted all suffering - that for those
Blessed Ones their birth was thus, their names were thus, their clans
were thus, their virtue was thus, their state [of concentration] was
thus, their wisdom was thus, their abiding [in attainments] was thus,
their deliverance was thus.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1160anc" HREF="#sdendnote1160sym"><SUP>mclx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >When
this was said, the venerable Ananda told the bhikkhus: “Friends,
Tathagatas are wonderful and have wonderful qualities. Tathagatas are
marvellous and have marvellous qualities.” [119]</P>
<P  >However,
their discussion was interrupted; for the Blessed One rose from
meditation when it was evening, went to the assembly hall, and sat
down on a seat made ready. Then he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
“Bhikkhus, for what discussion are you sitting together here now?
And what was your discussion that was interrupted?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
venerable sir, we were sitting in the assembly hall, where we had met
together on returning from our almsround, after our meal, when this
discussion arose among us: ‘It is wonderful, friends, it is
marvellous … their deliverance was thus.’ When this was said,
venerable sir, the venerable Ananda said to us: ‘Friends,
Tathagatas are wonderful and have wonderful qualities. Tathagatas are
marvellous and have marvellous qualities.’ This was our discussion,
venerable sir, that was interrupted when the Blessed One arrived.”</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda: “That being so,
Ananda, explain more fully the Tathagata’s wonderful and marvellous
qualities.”</P>
<P  >3.
“1 heard and learned this, venerable sir, from the Blessed One’s
own lips: ‘Mindful and fully aware, Ananda, the Bodhisatta appeared
in the Tusita heaven.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1161anc" HREF="#sdendnote1161sym"><SUP>mclxi</SUP></A></SUP>
That [120] mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta appeared in the

of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >4.
“1 heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips:
‘Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita
heaven.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality

the whole of his life-span the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita

“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips:
‘Mindful and fully aware the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita
heaven and descended into his mother’s womb.’ This too I remember
as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >7.
“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When
the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven and descended into
his mother’s womb, then a great immeasurable light surpassing the
splendour of the gods appeared in the world with its gods, its Maras,
and its Brahmas, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins,
with its princes and its people. And even in those abysmal world
interspaces of vacancy, gloom, and utter darkness, where the moon and
the sun, mighty and powerful as they are, cannot make their light
prevail - there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the
splendour of the gods appeared.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1162anc" HREF="#sdendnote1162sym"><SUP>mclxii</SUP></A></SUP>
And the beings born there perceived each other by that light: “So

ten-thousandfold world system shook and quaked and trembled, and
there too a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the
gods appeared.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous
quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >8.
“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When
the Bodhisatta had descended into his mother’s womb, four young
deities came to guard him at the four quarters so that no humans or
non-humans or anyone at all could harm the Bodhisatta or his
mother.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1163anc" HREF="#sdendnote1163sym"><SUP>mclxiii</SUP></A></SUP>

“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When
the Bodhisatta had descended into his mother’s womb, she became
intrinsically virtuous, refraining from killing living beings, from
taking what is not given, from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from
false speech, and from wines, liquors, and intoxicants, which are the
basis of negligence.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and
marvellous quality of the Blessed One. [121]</P>
<P  >10.
“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When
the Bodhisatta had descended into his mother’s womb, no sensual
thought arose in her concerning men, and she was inaccessible to any
man having a lustful mind.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and
marvellous quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >11.
“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When
the Bodhisatta had descended into his mother’s womb, she obtained
the five cords of sensual pleasure, and furnished and endowed with
them, she enjoyed herself with them.’ This too I remember as a
wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >12.
“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When
the Bodhisatta had descended into his mother’s womb, no kind of
affliction arose in her; she was blissful and free from bodily
fatigue. She saw the Bodhisatta within her womb with all his limbs,
lacking no faculty. Suppose a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown
thread were strung through a fine beryl gem of purest water,
eight-faceted, well cut, and a man with good sight were to take it in
his hand and review it thus: “This is a fine beryl gem of purest
water, eight-faceted, well cut, and through it is strung a blue,
yellow, red, white, or brown thread”; so too when the Bodhisatta
had descended into his mother’s womb … she saw the Bodhisatta
within her womb with all his limbs, lacking no faculty.’ This too I
remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.
[122]</P>
<P  >13.
“1 heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Seven
days after the birth of the Bodhisatta, his mother died and
reappeared in the Tusita heaven.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1164anc" HREF="#sdendnote1164sym"><SUP>mclxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
Blessed One.</P>
<P  >14.
“1 heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Other
women give birth after carrying the child in the womb for nine or ten
months, but not so the Bodhisatta’s mother. The Bodhisatta’s
mother gave birth after carrying him in her womb for exactly ten
months.’ This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality
of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >15.
“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Other
women give birth seated or lying down, but not so the Bodhisatta’s
mother. The Bodhisatta’s mother gave birth to him standing up.’

received him, then human beings.’ This too I remember as a
wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >17.
“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When
the Bodhisatta came forth from his mother’s womb, he did not touch
the earth. The four young gods received him and set him before his
mother saying: “Rejoice, 0 queen, a son of great power has been
born to you.’“This too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous
quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >18.
“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When
the Bodhisatta came forth from his mother’s womb, he came forth
unsullied, unsmeared [123] by water or humours or blood or any kind
of impurity, clean, and unsullied. Suppose there were a gem placed on
Kasi cloth, then the gem would not smear the cloth or the cloth the
gem. Why is that? Because of the purity of both. So too when the
Bodhisatta came forth … clean and unsullied.’ This too I remember
as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >19.
“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘When

“I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘As
soon as the Bodhisatta was born, he stood firmly with his feet on the
ground; then he took seven steps north, and with a white parasol held
over him, he surveyed each quarter and uttered the words of the
Leader of the Herd: “I am the highest in the world; I am the best
in the world; I am the foremost in the world. This is my last birth;
now there is no renewal of being for me.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1165anc" HREF="#sdendnote1165sym"><SUP>mclxv</SUP></A></SUP>

immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in

mother’s womb, then a great immeasurable light surpassing the
splendour of the gods appeared … this too I remember as a wonderful
and marvellous quality of the Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >22.
“That being so, Ananda, remember this too as a wonderful and
marvellous quality of the Tathagata: Here, Ananda, for the Tathagata
feelings are known as they arise, as they are present, as they
disappear; perceptions are known as they arise, as they are present,
as they disappear; thoughts are known as they arise, as they are
present, as they disappear.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1166anc" HREF="#sdendnote1166sym"><SUP>mclxvi</SUP></A></SUP>

“Venerable sir, since for the Blessed One feelings are known as

known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; thoughts
are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear -
this too I remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the

124. Bakkula Sutta - Bakkula</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Bakkula was living
at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1167anc" HREF="#sdendnote1167sym"><SUP>mclxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Then Acela Kassapa, a former companion of the venerable Bakkula in
his lay life, [125] went to the venerable Bakkula and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and asked the venerable Bakkula:</P>
<P  >3.
“Friend Bakkula, how long is it since you went forth?”</P>
<P  >“It
is eighty years since I went forth, friend.”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Bakkula, in these eighty years how many times have you engaged in
sexual intercourse?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Kassapa, you should not ask me such a question as that. You should
ask me such a question as this: ‘Friend Bakkula, in these eighty
years how many times have perceptions of sensual desire arisen in
you?’“</P>
<P  >“Friend
Bakkula, in these eighty years how many times have perceptions of
sensual desire arisen in you?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Kassapa, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any
perception of sensual desire to have ever arisen in me.”</P>
<P  >[That
in the eighty years since he went forth the venerable Bakkula did not
recall any perception of sensual desire to have ever arisen in him -
this we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula. ]<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1168anc" HREF="#sdendnote1168sym"><SUP>mclxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4-5.
“Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any
perception of ill will … any perception of cruelty to have ever
arisen in me.”</P>
<P  >[That
in the eighty years since he went forth the venerable Bakkula did not
recall any perception of ill will … any perception of cruelty to
have ever arisen in him - this we remember as a wonderful and

“Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any
thought of sensual desire to have ever arisen in me.”</P>
<P  >[ …

<P  >7-8.
“Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any
thought of ill will … any thought of cruelty to have ever arisen in
me.”</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.] [126]</P>
<P  >9-15.
“Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall
ever having accepted a robe from a householder<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1169anc" HREF="#sdendnote1169sym"><SUP>mclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
… ever having worn a robe given by a householder … ever having
cut a robe with a cutter … ever having sewn a robe with a needle …
ever having coloured a robe with dye … ever having sewn a robe at
the kathina time … ever having worked on making robes for my
companions in the holy life.”</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >16-19.
“Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall
ever having accepted an invitation to a meal … ever having given
rise to the thought: ‘Oh, may someone invite me to a meal!’ …
ever having sat down inside a house … ever having eaten inside a
house.”</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >20-25.
“Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall
ever having grasped at the signs and features of a woman … ever
having taught the Dhamma to a woman, even as much as a four-line
stanza … ever having gone to the bhikkhunis’ quarters … ever
having taught the Dhamma to a bhikkhuni … ever having taught the
Dhamma to a female probationer … ever having taught the Dhamma to a
female novice.”</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >26-29.
“Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall
ever having given the going forth … ever having given the full
admission … ever having given dependence … ever having had a
novice wait on me.”</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >30-37.
“Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall
ever having bathed in a bath house. ..ever having bathed with bath
powder … ever having undertaking the work of massaging the limbs of
my companions in the holy life [127] … ever having had an
affliction arise in me even for as long as it takes to milk a cow …
ever having taken medicine, even as much as a piece of gallnut …
ever having used a bolster … ever having made up a bed … ever
having entered upon residence for the Rains in a resting place inside
a village.”</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >38.
“Friend, for seven days after going forth I ate the country’s
almsfood as a debtor; on the eighth day final knowledge</P>
<P  >arose.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1170anc" HREF="#sdendnote1170sym"><SUP>mclxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >[That
for seven days the venerable Bakkula ate the country’s almsfood as
a debtor, and on the eighth day final knowledge arose - this too we
remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the venerable
Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >39.
[Then Acela Kassapa said:] “I would receive the going forth in this
Dhamma and Discipline, I would receive the full admission.” And
Acela Kassapa received the going forth in this Dhamma and Discipline,
he received the full admission.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1171anc" HREF="#sdendnote1171sym"><SUP>mclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
And soon, not long after his full admission, dwelling alone,
withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Kassapa, by
realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered
upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of
which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness.
He knew directly: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being.” And the venerable Kassapa became one of the
arahants.</P>
<P  >40.
Then, on a later occasion, the venerable Bakkula took a key and went
from cell to cell, saying: “Come forth, venerable sirs; come forth,
venerable sirs. Today I shall attain final Nibbana.”</P>
<P  >[That
the venerable Bakkula took a key and went from cell to cell saying:
“Come forth, venerable sirs; come forth, venerable sirs. Today I
shall attain final Nibbana” - this too we remember as a wonderful

<P  >41.
Then, seated in the midst of the Sangha of bhikkhus, the venerable
Bakkula attained final Nibbana.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1172anc" HREF="#sdendnote1172sym"><SUP>mclxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<H2 NAME="Heading126"  >
125. Dantabhumi Sutta - The Grade of the Tamed</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the novice Aciravata was living in a forest hut.
Then Prince Jayasena, while wandering and walking for exercise, went
to the novice Aciravata and exchanged greetings with him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1174anc" HREF="#sdendnote1174sym"><SUP>mclxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and said to the novice Aciravata: “Master Aggivessana, I have
heard that a bhikkhu who abides here diligent, ardent, and resolute
can achieve unification of mind.”</P>
<P  >“That
is so, prince, that is so. A bhikkhu who abides here diligent,
ardent, and resolute can achieve unification of mind.”</P>
<P  >3.
“It would be good if Master Aggivessana would teach me the Dhamma
as he has heard it and mastered it.”</P>
<P  >“I
cannot teach you the Dhamma, prince, as I have heard it and mastered
it. For if I were to teach you the Dhamma as I have heard it and
mastered it, you would not understand the meaning of my words, and
that would be wearying and troublesome for me.” [129]</P>
<P  >4.
“Let Master Aggivessana teach me the Dhamma as he has heard it and
mastered it. Perhaps I can understand the meaning of his words.”</P>
<P  >“I
shall teach you the Dhamma, prince, as I have heard it and mastered
it. If you can understand the meaning of my words, that will be good.
But if you cannot understand the meaning, then leave it at that and
do not question me about it further.”</P>
<P  >“Let
Master Aggivessana teach me the Dhamma as he has heard it and
mastered it. If I can understand the meaning of his words, that will
be good. If I cannot understand the meaning, then I will leave it at
that and I will not question him about it further.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then the novice Aciravata taught Prince Jayasena the Dhamma as he had
heard it and mastered it. After he had spoken, Prince Jayasena
remarked: “It is impossible, Master Aggivessana, it cannot happen
that a bhikkhu who abides diligent, ardent, and resolute can achieve
unification of mind.” Then, having declared to the novice Aciravata
that this was impossible and could not happen, Prince Jayasena rose
from his seat and departed.</P>
<P  >6.
Soon after Prince Jayasena had left, the novice Aciravata went to the
Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at
one side and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with
Prince Jayasena. When he had finished, the Blessed One said to him:</P>
<P  >7.
“Aggivessana, how is it possible that Prince Jayasena, living in
the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying sensual pleasures, being
devoured by thoughts of sensual pleasures, being consumed by the
fever of sensual pleasures, bent on the search for sensual pleasures,
[130] could know, see, or realise that which must be known through
renunciation, seen through renunciation, attained through
renunciation, realised through renunciation? That is impossible.</P>
<P  >8.
“Suppose,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1175anc" HREF="#sdendnote1175sym"><SUP>mclxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Aggivessana, there were two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that
were well tamed and well disciplined, and two tamable elephants,
horses, or oxen that were untamed and undisciplined. What do you
think, Aggivessana? Would the two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen
that were well tamed and well disciplined, being tamed, acquire the
behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of the tamed?”
- “Yes, venerable sir.” - “But would the two tamable elephants,
horses, or oxen that were untamed and undisciplined, being untamed,
acquire the behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of
the tamed, like the two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were
well tamed and well disciplined?” - “No, venerable sir.” - “So
too, Aggivessana, it is impossible that Prince Jayasena, living in
the midst of sensual pleasures, … could know, see, or realise that
which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation,
attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation.</P>
<P  >9.
“Suppose, Aggivessana, there were a high mountain not far from a
village or town, and two friends would leave the village or town and
approach the mountain hand in hand. Having reached it, one friend
would remain below at the foot of the mountain while the other would
climb to the top. Then the friend who remained below at the foot of
the mountain would say to the friend who stood on the top: ‘Well,
friend, what do you see, standing on top of the mountain?’ And the
other replied:</P>
<P  >‘Standing
on top of the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks, lovely groves,
lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.’ Then the first friend would say:
‘It is impossible, [131] friend, it cannot happen that while
standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parks, lovely
groves, lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.’</P>
<P  >“Then
the other friend would come down to the foot of the mountain, take
his friend by the arm, and make him climb to the top of the mountain.
After giving him a few moments to catch his breath, he would ask:
‘Well, friend, standing on top of the mountain, what do you see?’
And his friend would reply: ‘Standing on top of the mountain,
friend, I see lovely parks, lovely groves, lovely meadows, and lovely
ponds.’ Then the other would say: ‘Friend, just a little earlier
we heard you say: “It is impossible, friend, it cannot happen that
while standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parks …
lovely ponds.” But just now we heard you say: “Standing on top of
the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks … lovely ponds.’“Then
the first friend would reply: ‘Because I was obstructed by this
high mountain, friend, I did not see what was there to be seen.’</P>
<P  >10.
“So too, Aggivessana, Prince Jayasena is obstructed, hindered,
blocked, and enveloped by a still greater mass than this - the mass
of ignorance. Thus it is impossible that Prince Jayasena, living in
the midst of sensual pleasures, … could know, see, or realise that
which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation,
attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation.</P>
<P  >11.
“Aggivessana, if these two similes had occurred to you [with
reference] to Prince Jayasena, he would have spontaneously acquired
confidence in you, and being confident, would have shown his
confidence to you.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, how could these two similes have occurred to me [with reference]
to Prince Jayasena as they occur to the Blessed One, since they are
spontaneous and have never been heard before?”</P>
<P  >[132]
12. “Suppose, Aggivessana, a head-anointed noble king addresses his
elephant woodsman thus: ‘Good elephant woodsman, mount the king’s
elephant, enter the elephant wood, and when you see a forest
elephant, bind him by the neck to the king’s elephant.’ Having
replied ‘Yes, sire,’ the elephant woodsman mounts the king’s
elephant, enters the elephant wood, and when he sees a forest
elephant, binds him by the neck to the king’s elephant. The king’s
elephant leads him out into the open. It is in this way that a forest
elephant comes out into the open; for the forest elephant clings to
the elephant wood.</P>
<P  >“Then
the elephant woodsman informs the head-anointed noble king: ‘Sire,
the forest elephant has come out into the open.’ The king addresses
his elephant tamer thus: ‘Come, good elephant tamer, tame the
forest elephant. Subdue his forest habits, subdue his forest memories
and intentions, subdue his distress, fatigue, and fever over leaving
the forest. Get him to take delight in the town, inculcate in him
habits congenial to human beings.’ Having replied ‘Yes, sire,’
the elephant tamer plants a large post in the earth and binds the
forest elephant to it by the neck in order to subdue his forest
habits … and to inculcate in him habits congenial to human beings.</P>
<P  >“Then
the elephant tamer addresses the elephant with words that are gentle,
pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to the heart, are courteous,
desired by many, and agreeable to many. When the forest elephant
[133] is addressed by such words, he listens, gives ear, and exerts
his mind to understand. The elephant tamer next rewards him with
grass-fodder and water. When the forest elephant accepts the
grass-fodder and water from him, the elephant tamer knows: ‘Now the
king’s elephant will live!’</P>
<P  >“Then
the elephant tamer trains him further thus: ‘Take up, put down!’
When the king’s elephant obeys his tamer’s orders to take up and
put down and carries out his instructions, the elephant tamer trains
him further thus: ‘Go forward, go back!’ When the king’s
elephant obeys his tamer’s orders to go forward and go back and
carries out his instructions, the elephant tamer trains him further
thus: ‘Get up, sit down!’ When the king’s elephant obeys his
tamer’s orders to get up and sit down and carries out his
instructions, the elephant tamer trains him further in the task
called imperturbability. He ties a giant plank to his trunk; a man
with a lance in his hand sits on his neck; men with lances in their
hands surround him on all sides; and the elephant tamer himself
stands in front of him holding a long lance pole. When the elephant
is being trained in the task of imperturbability, he does not move
his forelegs or his hindlegs; he does not move his forequarters or
his hindquarters; he does not move his head, ears, tusks, tail, or
trunk. The king’s elephant is able to endure blows from spears,
blows from swords, blows from arrows, blows from other beings, and
the thundering sounds of drums, kettledrums, trumpets, and tomtoms.
Being rid of all faults and defects, purged of flaws, he is worthy of
the king, in the king’s service, considered one of the factors of a
king. [134]</P>
<P  >13-14.
“So too, Aggivessana, a Tathagata appears in the world,
accomplished, fully enlightened … (as Sutta 51, §§12-13) … he
shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the yellow robe, and goes
forth from the home life into homelessness. It is in this way that a
noble disciple comes out into the open; for gods and humans cling to
the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >15.
“Then the Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be
virtuous, restrained with the restraint of the Patimokkha, be perfect
in conduct and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, train
by undertaking the training precepts.’</P>
<P  >16.
“When, Aggivessana, the noble disciple is virtuous … and seeing
fear in the slightest fault, trains by undertaking the training
precepts, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come,
bhikkhu, guard the doors of your sense faculties. On seeing a form
with the eye, do not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if you
were to leave the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of
covetousness and grief might invade you, practise the way of its
restraint, guard the eye faculty, undertake the restraint of the eye
faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear … On smelling an odour
with the nose … On tasting a flavour with the tongue … On
touching a tangible with the body … On cognizing a mind-object with
the mind, do not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if you were
to leave the mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of
covetousness and grief might invade you, practise the way of its
restraint, guard the mind faculty, undertake the restraint of the
mind faculty.’</P>
<P  >17.
“When, Aggivessana, the noble disciple guards the doors of his
sense faculties, then the Tathagata disciplines him further:</P>
<P  >‘Come,
bhikkhu, be moderate in eating. Reflecting wisely, you should take
food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of
physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and
continuance of this body, for ending discomfort, and for assisting
the holy life, considering: “Thus I shall terminate old feelings
without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless
and shall live in comfort.’“</P>
<P  >18.
“When, [135] Aggivessana, the noble disciple is moderate in eating,
then the Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be
devoted to wakefulness. During the day, while walking back and forth
and sitting, purify your mind of obstructive states. In the first
watch of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify
your mind of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night you
should lie down on the right side in the lion’s pose with one foot
overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in your
mind the time for rising. After rising, in the last watch of the
night, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify your mind of
obstructive states.’</P>
<P  >19.
“When, Aggivessana, the noble disciple is devoted to wakefulness,
then the Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be
possessed of mindfulness and full awareness. Act in full awareness
when going forward and returning … when looking ahead and looking
away … when flexing and extending your limbs … when wearing your
robes and carrying your outer robe and bowl … when eating,
drinking, consuming food, and tasting. . .when defecating and
urinating … when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking
up, talking, and keeping silent.’</P>
<P  >20.
“When, Aggivessana, the noble disciple possesses mindfulness and
full awareness, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come,
bhikkhu, resort to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of
a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a
jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.’</P>
<P  >21.
“He resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest … a heap of
straw. On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down,
folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing
mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he
abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from
covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind
free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living
beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Abandoning
sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of
light, mindful, and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and
torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated
with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness
and remorse. [136] Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond
doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from
doubt.</P>
<P  >22.
“Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, he abides contemplating the body as a body,
ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and
grief for the world. He abides contemplating feelings as feelings …
mind as mind … mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware,
and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1176anc" HREF="#sdendnote1176sym"><SUP>mclxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
“Just as, Aggivessana, the elephant tamer plants a large post in
the earth and binds the forest elephant to it by the neck in order to
subdue his forest habits … and to inculcate in him habits congenial
to human beings, so these four foundations of mindfulness are the
bindings for the mind of the noble disciple in order to subdue his
habits based on the household life, to subdue his memories and
intentions based on the household life, to subdue his distress,
fatigue, and fever based on the household life, and in order that he
may attain the true way and realise Nibbana.</P>
<P  >24.
“Then the Tathagata disciplines him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu,
abide contemplating the body as a body but do not think thoughts
connected with the body; abide contemplating feelings as feelings but
do not think thoughts connected with feelings; abide contemplating
mind as mind but do not think thoughts connected with the mind; abide
contemplating mindobjects as mind-objects but do not think thoughts
connected with mind-objects.’</P>
<P  >25.
“With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon
and abides in the second jhana<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1177anc" HREF="#sdendnote1177sym"><SUP>mclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
… the third jhana … the fourth jhana.</P>
<P  >26-29.
“When his concentrated mind is thus purified … (as Sutta 51,
§§24-27) … He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.’</P>
<P  >30.
“That bhikkhu is able to endure cold and heat, hunger and thirst,
and contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the sun, and creeping
things; he is able to endure ill-spoken, unwelcome words and arisen
bodily [137] feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing,
disagreeable, distressing, and menacing to life. Being rid of all
lust, hate, and delusion, purged of flaws, he is worthy of gifts,
worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential
salutations, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.</P>
<P  >31.
“If, Aggivessana, the king’s elephant dies in old age untamed and
undisciplined, then. he is considered an old elephant that has died
an untamed death. If the king’s elephant dies when middle-aged
untamed and undisciplined, then he is considered a middle-aged
elephant that has died an untamed death. If the king’s elephant
dies when young untamed and undisciplined, then he is considered a
young elephant that has died an untamed death. So too, Aggivessana,
if an elder bhikkhu dies with his taints undestroyed, then he is
considered an elder bhikkhu who has died an untamed death. If a
bhikkhu of middle status dies with his taints undestroyed, then he is
considered a bhikkhu of middle status who has died an untamed death.
If a newly ordained bhikkhu dies with his taints undestroyed, then he
is considered a newly ordained bhikkhu who has died an untamed death.</P>
<P  >32.
“If, Aggivessana, the king’s elephant dies in old age well tamed
and well disciplined, then he is considered an old elephant that has
died a tamed death. If the king’s elephant dies when middle-aged
well tamed and well disciplined, then he is considered a middle-aged
elephant that has died a tamed death. If the king’s elephant dies
when young well tamed and well disciplined, then he is considered a
young elephant that has died a tamed death. So too, Aggivessana, if
an elder bhikkhu dies with his taints destroyed, then he is
considered an elder bhikkhu who has died a tamed death. If a bhikkhu
of middle status dies with his taints destroyed, then he is
considered a bhikkhu of middle status who has died a tamed death. If
a newly ordained bhikkhu dies with his taints destroyed, then he is
considered a newly ordained bhikkhu who has died a tamed death.”</P>
<P  >That

delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

126. Bhumija Sutta - Bhumija</H2>
<P  >[138]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Bhumija dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, went to the house of Prince Jayasena and sat
down on a seat made ready.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1178anc" HREF="#sdendnote1178sym"><SUP>mclxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then Prince Jayasena went to the venerable Bhumija and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said to the venerable Bhumija:
“Master Bhumija, there are some recluses and brahmins who make such
assertions and hold such views as this: ‘If one makes an
aspiration<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1179anc" HREF="#sdendnote1179sym"><SUP>mclxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
and one leads the holy life, one is unable to procure any fruit; if
one makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life, one is still
unable to procure any fruit; if one both makes an aspiration and
makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life, one is still unable
to procure any fruit; if one neither makes an aspiration nor makes no
aspiration and one leads the holy life, one is still unable to
procure any fruit.’ What does the venerable Bhumija’s teacher say
here, what does he declare?”</P>
<P  >4.
“1 have not heard and learned that from the Blessed One’s own
lips, prince. But it is possible that the Blessed One might say this:
‘If one makes an aspiration and one leads the holy life unwisely,
one is unable to procure any fruit; if one makes no aspiration and
one leads the holy life unwisely, one is still unable to procure any
fruit; if one both makes an aspiration and makes no aspiration and
one leads the holy life unwisely, one is still unable to procure any
fruit; if one neither makes an aspiration nor makes no aspiration and
one leads the holy life unwisely, one is still unable to procure any
fruit. However, if one makes an aspiration and one leads the holy
life wisely, one is able to procure fruit; [139] if one makes no
aspiration and one leads the holy life wisely, one is still able to
procure fruit; if one both makes an aspiration and makes no
aspiration and one leads the holy life wisely, one is still able to
procure fruit; if one neither makes an aspiration nor makes no
aspiration and one leads the holy life wisely, one is still able to
procure fruit.’ I have not heard and learned this from the Blessed
One’s own lips, prince, but it is possible that the Blessed One
would answer as I have stated.”</P>
<P  >5.
“If Master Bhumija’s teacher speaks thus, if he declares thus,
then it certainly seems that the venerable Bhumija’s teacher stands
ahead of all the ordinary recluses and brahmins.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then Prince Jayasena served the venerable Bhumija from his own dish
of milk rice.</P>
<P  >7.
Then, when the venerable Bhumija had returned from his almsround
after his meal, he went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to
him, he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what had
occurred, adding: “Venerable sir, I hope that when I was asked such
a question and answered thus, I said what has been said by the
Blessed One and did not misrepresent him with what is contrary to
fact. I hope I explained in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way
that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately
deduced from my assertion.” [140]</P>
<P  >8.
“Surely, Bhumija, when you were asked such a question and answered
thus, you said what has been said by me and did not misrepresent me
with what is contrary to fact. You explained in accordance with the
Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure
can be legitimately deduced from your assertion.</P>
<P  >9.
“Whatever recluses and brahmins have wrong view, wrong intention,

exalted, and another bhikkhu abides resolved upon an area the size of
one village, pervading it as exalted … an area the size of one
village and an area the size of two or three villages … an area the
size of two or three villages [150] and an area the size of one major
kingdom … an area the size of one major kingdom and an area the
size of two or three major kingdoms … an area the size of two or
three major kingdoms and an area the size of the earth bounded by the
ocean, pervading it as exalted - which of these two types of mental
development is more exalted?” - “The second, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“This
is the cause and reason, friend Kaccana, why among those deities that
have reappeared in a single order of gods, some are deities of
Limited Radiance, some deities of Immeasurable Radiance.”</P>
<P  >15.
“Good, venerable Anuruddha, yet I have something further to ask:
Are all those radiant ones deities of Defiled Radiance, or are some
of them deities of Pure Radiance?” [151]</P>
<P  >“By
reason of the factor [responsible for rebirth], friend Kaccana, some
are deities of Defiled Radiance, some deities of Pure Radiance.”</P>
<P  >16.
“Venerable Anuruddha, what is the cause and reason why among those
deities that have reappeared in a single order of gods, some are
deities of Defiled Radiance, some deities of Pure Radiance?”</P>
<P  >“As
to that, friend Kaccana, I shall give a simile, for some wise men
here understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile.
Suppose an oil-lamp is burning with impure oil and an impure wick;
because of the impurity of its oil and its wick it burns dimly. So
too, here a bhikkhu abides resolved upon and pervading [an area with]
a defiled radiance. His bodily inertia has not fully subsided, his
sloth and torpor have not been fully eliminated, his restlessness and
remorse have not been fully removed; because of this he meditates, as
it were, dimly.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1184anc" HREF="#sdendnote1184sym"><SUP>mclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in the
company of the gods of Defiled Radiance.</P>
<P  >“Suppose

<P  >“This
is the cause and reason, friend Kaccana, why among those deities that

<P  >17.
When this was said, the venerable Abhiya Kaccana said to the
venerable Anuruddha: “Good, venerable Anuruddha. The venerable
Anuruddha does not say: ‘Thus have I heard’ or ‘It should be
thus.’ Rather, the venerable Anuruddha says: ‘These gods are thus
and those gods are such.’ It occurs to me, venerable sir, that the
venerable Anuruddha certainly has associated with those deities and
talked with them and held conversations with them.”</P>
<P  >“Certainly,
friend Kaccana, your words are offensive and discourteous, but still
I will answer you. Over a long time I have associated with those
deities and talked with them and held conversations with them.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1185anc" HREF="#sdendnote1185sym"><SUP>mclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >18.
When this was said, the venerable Abhiya Kaccana said to the
carpenter Pancakanga: “It is a gain for you, householder, it is a
great gain for you that you have abandoned your state of doubt and
have had the opportunity to hear this discourse on the Dhamma.”</P>

<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Kosambi in Ghosita’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the bhikkhus at Kosambi had taken to quarrelling
and brawling and were deep in disputes, stabbing each other with
verbal daggers.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1186anc" HREF="#sdendnote1186sym"><SUP>mclxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One, [153] and after
paying homage to him, he stood at one side and said: “Venerable
sir, the bhikkhus here at Kosambi have taken to quarrelling and
brawling and are deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal
daggers. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would go
to those bhikkhus out of compassion.” The Blessed One consented in
silence.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One went to those bhikkhus and said to them:
“Enough, bhikkhus, let there be no quarrelling, brawling,
wrangling, or dispute.” When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said
to the Blessed One: “Wait, venerable sir! Let the Blessed One, the
Lord of the Dhamma, live at ease devoted to a pleasant abiding here
and now. We are the ones who will be responsible for this
quarrelling, brawling, wrangling, and dispute.”</P>
<P  >For
a second time … For a third time the Blessed One said: “Enough,
bhikkhus, let there be no quarrelling, brawling, wrangling, or
dispute.” For a third time that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One:
“Wait, venerable sir! … We are the ones who will be responsible
for this quarrelling, brawling, wrangling, and dispute.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, entered Kosambi for alms. When he had wandered
for alms in Kosambi and had returned from his almsround, after his
meal he set his resting place in order, took his bowl and outer robe,
and while still standing uttered these stanzas: [154]</P>
<P  >6.
“When many voices shout at once None considers himself a fool;
Though the Sangha is being split None thinks himself to be at fault.</P>
<P >
They have forgotten thoughtful speech,</P>

They talk obsessed by words alone.</P>

Uncurbed their mouths, they bawl at will;</P>

<P >
But if one finds no worthy friend,</P>
<P >
No virtuous, steadfast companion,</P>

Then as a king leaves his conquered realm,</P>

Walk like a tusker in the woods alone.</P>
<P >
Better it is to walk alone,</P>

There is no companionship with fools.</P>

Walk alone and do no evil, At ease like a tusker in the woods.”</P>

<P  >7.
Then, having uttered these stanzas while standing, the Blessed One
went to the village of Balakalonakara. On that occasion [155] the
venerable Bhagu was living at the village of Balakalonakara. When the
venerable Bhagu saw the Blessed One coming in the distance, he
prepared a seat and set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed
One sat down on the seat made ready and washed his feet. The
venerable Bhagu paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one
side, and the Blessed One said to him: “I hope you are keeping
well, bhikkhu, I hope you are comfortable, I hope you are not having
any trouble getting almsfood.”</P>
<P  >“I
am keeping well, Blessed One, I am comfortable, and I am not having
any trouble getting almsfood.”</P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged the
venerable Bhagu with talk on the Dhamma, after which he rose from his
seat and went to the Eastern Bamboo Park.</P>
<P  >8.
Now on that occasion the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya
and the venerable Kimbila were living at the Eastern Bamboo Park.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1188anc" HREF="#sdendnote1188sym"><SUP>mclxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
The park keeper saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and told
him: “Do not enter this park, recluse. There are three clansmen
here seeking their own good. Do not disturb them.”</P>
<P  >9.
The venerable Anuruddha heard the park keeper speaking to the Blessed
One and told him: “Friend park keeper, do not keep the Blessed One
out. It is our Teacher, the Blessed One, who has come.” Then the
venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Nandiya and the venerable
Kimbila and said: “Come out, venerable sirs, come out! Our Teacher,
the Blessed One, has come.”</P>
<P  >10.
Then all three went to meet the Blessed One. One took his bowl and
outer robe, one prepared a seat, and one set out water for washing
the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready and washed
his feet. Then those three venerable ones paid homage to the Blessed
One and sat down at one side, and the Blessed One said to them: “I
hope you are all keeping well, Anuruddha, I hope you are comfortable,
I hope you are not having any trouble getting almsfood.” [156]</P>
<P  >“We
are keeping well, Blessed One, we are comfortable, and we are not
having any trouble getting almsfood.”</P>
<P  >11.
“I hope, Anuruddha, that you are all living in concord, with mutual
appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water,
viewing each other with kindly eyes.”</P>
<P  >“Surely,
venerable sir, we are living in concord, with mutual appreciation,
without disputing, blending like milk and water, viewing each other
with kindly eyes.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Anuruddha, how do you live thus?”</P>
<P  >12.
“Venerable sir, as to that, I think thus: ‘It is a gain for me,
it is a great gain for me that I am living with such companions in
the holy life.’ I maintain bodily acts of loving-kindness towards
these venerable ones both openly and privately; I maintain verbal
acts of loving-kindness towards them both openly and privately; I
maintain mental acts of loving-kindness towards them both openly and
privately. I consider: ‘Why should I not set aside what I wish to
do and do what these venerable ones wish to do?’ Then I set aside
what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do. We are
different in body, venerable sir, but one in mind.”</P>
<P  >The
venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila each spoke likewise,
adding: “That is how, venerable sir, we are living in concord, with
mutual appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water,
viewing each other with kindly eyes.”</P>
<P  >13.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. I hope that you all abide diligent, ardent,
and resolute.” [157]</P>
<P  >“Surely,
venerable sir, we abide diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Anuruddha, how do you abide thus?”</P>
<P  >14.
“Venerable sir, as to that, whichever of us returns first from the
village with almsfood prepares the seats, sets out the water for
drinking and for washing, and puts the refuse bucket in its place.
Whichever of us returns last eats any food left over, if he wishes;
otherwise he throws it away where there is no greenery or drops it
into water where there is no life. He puts away the seats and the
water for drinking and for washing. He puts away the refuse bucket
after washing it, and he sweeps out the refectory. Whoever notices
that the pots of water for drinking, washing, or the latrine are low
or empty takes care of them.</P>
<P  >If
they are too heavy for him, he calls someone else by a signal of the
hand and they move it by joining hands, but because of this we do not
break out into speech. But every five days we sit together all night
discussing the Dhamma. That is how we abide diligent, ardent, and
resolute.”</P>
<P  >15.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. But while you abide thus diligent, ardent,
and resolute, have you attained any superhuman states, a distinction
in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable
abiding?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, as we abide here diligent, ardent, and resolute, we perceive
both light and a vision of forms.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1189anc" HREF="#sdendnote1189sym"><SUP>mclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>

Anuruddha. Before my enlightenment, while I was still only an
unenlightened Bodhisatta, I too perceived both light and a vision of
forms. Soon afterwards the light [158] and the vision of forms
disappeared. I thought: ‘What is the cause and condition why the
light and the vision of forms have disappeared?’ Then I considered
thus: ‘Doubt arose in me, and because of the doubt my concentration
fell away; when my concentration fell away, the light and the vision

“As, Anuruddha, I was abiding diligent … I considered thus:

<H2 NAME="Heading130"  >
129. Balapandita Sutta - Fools and Wise Men</H2>
<P  >[163]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<H3 >(THE FOOL)</H3>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, there are these three characteristics of a fool, signs
of a fool, attributes of a fool. What three? Here a fool is one who
thinks bad thoughts, speaks bad words, and does bad deeds. If a fool
were not so, how would the wise know him thus: ‘This person is a
fool, an untrue man’? But because a fool is one who thinks bad
thoughts, speaks bad words, and does bad deeds, the wise know him
thus: ‘This person is a fool, an untrue man.’</P>
<P  >3.
“A fool feels pain and grief here and now in three ways. If a fool
is seated in an assembly or along a street or in a square and people
there are discussing certain pertinent and relevant matters, then, if
the fool is one who kills living beings, takes what is not given,
misconducts himself in sensual pleasures, speaks falsehood, and
indulges in wine, liquor, and intoxicants, which are the basis of
negligence, he thinks: ‘These people are discussing certain
pertinent and relevant matters; these things are found in me, and I
am seen engaging in those things.’ This is the first kind of pain
and grief that a fool feels here and now.</P>
<P  >4.
“Again, when a robber culprit is caught, a fool sees kings having
many kinds of torture inflicted on him:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1198anc" HREF="#sdendnote1198sym"><SUP>mcxcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
[164] having him flogged with whips, beaten with canes, beaten with
clubs; having his hands cut off, his feet cut off, his hands and feet
cut off; his ears cut off, his nose cut off, his ears and nose cut
off; having him subjected to the ‘porridge pot,’ to the
‘polished-shell shave,’ to the ‘Rahu’s mouth,’ to the
‘fiery wreath,’ to the ‘flaming hand,’ to the ‘blades of
grass,’ to the ‘bark dress,’ to the ‘antelope,’ to the
‘meat hooks,’ to the ‘coins,’ to the ‘lye pickling,’ to
the ‘pivoting pin,’ to the ‘rolled-up palliasse’; and having
him splashed with boiling oil, and having him thrown to be devoured
by dogs, and having him impaled alive on stakes, and having his head
cut off with a sword. Then the fool thinks thus: ‘Because of such
evil actions as those, when a robber culprit is caught, kings have
many kinds of tortures inflicted on him: they have him flogged with
whips … and have his head cut off with a sword. Those things are
found in me, and I am seen engaging in those things.’ This is the
second kind of pain and grief that a fool feels here and now.</P>
<P  >5.
“Again, when a fool is on his chair or on his bed or resting on the
ground, then the evil actions that he did in the past - his bodily,
verbal, and mental misconduct - cover him, overspread him, and
envelop him. Just as the shadow of a great mountain peak in the
evening covers, overspreads, and envelops the earth, so too, when a
fool is on his chair or on his bed. or resting on the ground, [165]
then the evil actions that he did in the past - his bodily, verbal,
and mental misconduct - cover him, overspread him, and envelop him.
Then the fool thinks: ‘I have not done what is good, I have not
done what is wholesome, I have not made myself a shelter from
anguish. I have done what is evil, I have done what is cruel, I have
done what is wicked. When I pass away, I shall go to the destination
of those who have not done what is good … who have done what is
wicked.’ He sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his
breast and becomes distraught. This is the third kind of pain and
grief that a fool feels here and now.</P>
<P  >6.
“A fool who has given himself over to misconduct of body, speech,
and mind, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappears in a
state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, even in hell.</P>
<H3 >(HELL)</H3>
<P  >7.
“Were it rightly speaking to be said of anything: ‘That is
utterly unwished for, utterly undesired, utterly disagreeable,’ it
is of hell that, rightly speaking, this should be said, so much so
that it is hard to find a simile for the suffering in hell.” When
this was said, a bhikkhu asked the Blessed One: “But, venerable
sir, can a simile be given?”</P>
<P  >8.
“It can, bhikkhu,” the Blessed One said.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1199anc" HREF="#sdendnote1199sym"><SUP>mcxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
“Bhikkhus, suppose men caught a robber culprit and presented him to
the king, saying: ‘Sire, here is a robber culprit. Order what
punishment you will for him.’ Then the king said: ‘Go and strike
this man in the morning with a hundred spears.’ And they struck him
in the morning with a hundred spears. Then at noon the king asked:
‘How is that man?’ - ‘Sire, he is still alive.’ Then the king
said: ‘Go and strike that man at noon with a hundred spears.’ And
they struck him at noon with a hundred spears. Then in the evening
the king asked: ‘How is that man?’ - ‘Sire, he is still alive.’
Then the king said: ‘Go and strike that man in the evening with a
hundred spears.’ And they struck him in the evening with a hundred
spears. [166] What do you think, bhikkhus?’Would that man
experience pain and grief because of being struck with the three
hundred spears?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, that man would experience pain and grief because of being struck
with even one spear, let alone three hundred.”</P>
<P  >9.
Then, taking a small stone the size of his hand, the Blessed One
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is
the greater, this small stone that I have taken, the size of my hand,
or Himalaya, the king of mountains?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, the small stone that the Blessed One has taken, the size of his
hand, does not count beside Himalaya, the king of mountains; it is
not even a fraction, there is no comparison.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, bhikkhus, the pain and grief that the man would experience
because of being struck with the three hundred spears does not count
beside the suffering of hell; it is not even a fraction, there is no
comparison.</P>
<P  >10.
“Now the wardens of hell torture him with the fivefold transfixing.
They drive a red-hot iron stake through one hand, they drive a
red-hot iron stake through the other hand, they drive a red-hot iron
stake through one foot, they drive a red-hot iron stake through the
other foot, they drive a red-hot iron stake through his belly. There
he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so
long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >11.
“Next the wardens of hell throw him down and pare him with axes.
There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not
die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >12.
“Next the wardens of hell set him with his feet up and his head
down and pare him with adzes. There he feels painful, racking,
piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so long as that evil action
has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >13.
“Next the wardens of hell harness him to a chariot and drive him
back and forth across burning ground, blazing, and glowing. [167]
There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not
die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >14.
“Next the wardens of hell make him climb up and down a great mound
of burning coals, blazing, and glowing. There he feels painful,
racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so long as that evil
action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >15.
“Next the wardens of hell take him feet up and head down and plunge
him into a red-hot metal cauldron, burning, blazing, and glowing. He
is cooked there in a swirl of froth. And as he is being cooked there
in a swirl of froth, he is swept now up, now down, and now across.
There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not
die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >16.
“Next the wardens of hell throw him into the Great Hell. Now as to
that Great Hell, bhikkhus: It has four corners and is built</P>
<P >
With four doors, one set in each side,</P>
<P >
Walled up with iron and all around</P>
<P >
And shut in with an iron roof.</P>
<P >
Its floor as well is made of iron</P>
<P >
And heated till it glows with fire.</P>

“Bhikkhus, I could tell you in many ways about hell.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1200anc" HREF="#sdendnote1200sym"><SUP>mcc</SUP></A></SUP>
So much so that it is hard to find a simile for the suffering in
hell.</P>
<H3 >(THE ANIMAL KINGDOM)</H3>
<P  >18.
“Bhikkhus, there are animals that feed on grass. They eat by
cropping fresh or dried grass with their teeth. And what animals feed
on grass? Elephants, horses, cattle, donkeys, goats, and deer, and
any other such animals. A fool who formerly delighted in tastes here
and did evil actions here, on the dissolution of the body, after
death, reappears in the company of animals that feed on grass.</P>
<P  >19.
“There are animals that feed on dung. They smell dung from a
distance and run to it, thinking: ‘We can eat, we can eat!’ Just
as brahmins run to the smell of a sacrifice, thinking: ‘We can eat,
we can eat!’ so too these animals that feed on dung [168] smell
dung from a distance and run to it, thinking: ‘We can eat, we can
eat!’ And what animals feed on dung? Fowls, pigs, dogs, and
jackals, and any other such animals. A fool who formerly delighted in
tastes here and did evil actions here, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, reappears in the company of animals that feed on
dung.</P>
<P  >20.
“There are animals that are born, age, and die in darkness. And
what animals are born, age, and die in darkness? Moths, maggots, and
earthworms, and any other such animals. A fool who formerly delighted
in tastes here and did evil actions here, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, reappears in the company of animals that are born,
age, and die in darkness.</P>
<P  >21.
“There are animals that are born, age, and die in water. And what
animals are born, age, and die in water? Fish, turtles, and
crocodiles, and any other such animals. A fool who formerly delighted
in tastes here and did evil actions here, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, reappears in the company of animals that are born,
age, and die in water.</P>
<P  >22.
“There are animals that are born, age, and die in filth. And what
animals are born, age, and die in filth? Those animals that are born,
age, and die in a rotten fish or in a rotten corpse or in rotten
dough or in a cesspit or in a sewer. [169] A fool who formerly
delighted in tastes here and did evil actions here, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, reappears in the company of
animals that are born, age, and die in filth.</P>
<P  >23.
“Bhikkhus, I could tell you in many ways about the animal kingdom,
so much so that it is hard to find a simile for the suffering in the
animal kingdom.</P>
<P  >24.
“Suppose a man threw into the sea a yoke with one hole in it, and
the east wind carried it to the west, and the west wind carried it to
the east, and the north wind carried it to the south,</P>
<P  >and
the south wind carried it to the north. Suppose there were a blind
turtle that came up once at the end of each century. What do you
think, bhikkhus? Would that blind turtle put his neck into that yoke
with one hole in it?”</P>
<P  >“He
might, venerable sir, sometime or other at the end of a long period.”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhus,
the blind turtle would take less time to put his neck into that yoke
with a single hole in it than a fool, once gone to perdition, would
take to regain the human state, I say. Why is that? Because there is
no practising of the Dhamma there, no practising of what is
righteous, no doing of what is wholesome, no performance of merit.
There mutual devouring prevails, and the slaughter of the weak.</P>
<P  >25.
“If, sometime or other, at the end of a long period, that fool
comes back to the human state, it is into a low family that he is
reborn - into a family of outcasts or hunters or bamboo-workers or
cartwrights or scavengers - one that is poor with little to eat and
drink, surviving with difficulty, where he scarcely finds food and
clothing; and he is ugly, unsightly, and misshapen, sickly, blind,
cripple-handed, lame, or paralysed; he gets no food, drink, clothes,
[170] vehicles, garlands, scents and unguents, bed, lodging, and
light; he misconducts himself in body, speech, and mind, and having
done that, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears
in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition,
even in hell.</P>
<P  >26.
“Bhikkhus, suppose a gambler at the very first unlucky throw loses
his child and his wife and all his property and furthermore goes into
bondage himself, yet an unlucky throw such as that is negligible; it
is a far more unlucky throw when a fool who misconducts himself in
body, speech, and mind, on the dissolution of the body, after death,
reappears in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in
perdition, even in hell. This is the complete perfection of the
fool’s grade.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1201anc" HREF="#sdendnote1201sym"><SUP>mcci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(THE WISE MAN)</H3>
<P  >27.
“Bhikkhus, there are these three characteristics of a wise man,
signs of a wise man, attributes of a wise man. What three? Here a
wise man is one who thinks good thoughts, speaks good words, and does
good deeds. If a wise man were not so, how</P>
<P  >would
the wise know him thus: ‘This person is a wise man, a true man’?
But because a wise man is one who thinks good thoughts, speaks good
words, and does good deeds, the wise know him thus: ‘This person is
a wise man, a true man.’</P>
<P  >28.
“A wise man feels pleasure and joy here and now in three ways. If a
wise man is seated in an assembly or along a street or in a square
and people there are discussing certain pertinent and relevant
matters, then, if the wise man is one who abstains from killing
living beings, from taking what is not given, from misconduct in
sensual pleasures, [171] from false speech, from wine, liquor, and
intoxicants, which are the basis of negligence, he thinks: ‘These
people are discussing certain pertinent and relevant matters; those
things are not found in me, and I am not seen engaging in them.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1202anc" HREF="#sdendnote1202sym"><SUP>mccii</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the first kind of pleasure and joy that a wise man feels here
and now.</P>
<P  >29.
“Again, when a robber culprit is caught, a wise man sees kings
having many kinds of torture inflicted on him … (as in §4) …
Then the wise man thinks thus: ‘Because of such evil actions as
those, when a robber culprit is caught, kings have many kinds of
tortures inflicted on him. Those things are not found in me, and I am
not seen engaging in those things.’ This is the second kind of
pleasure and joy that a wise man feels here and now.</P>
<P  >30.
“Again, when a wise man is on his chair or on his bed or resting on
the ground, then the good actions that he did in the past - his good
bodily, verbal, and mental conduct - cover him, overspread him, and
envelop him. Just as the shadow of a great mountain peak in the
evening covers, overspreads, and envelops the earth, so too, when a
wise man is on his chair or on his bed or resting on the ground, then
the good actions that he did in the past - his good bodily, verbal,
and mental conduct - cover him, overspread him, and envelop him. Then
the wise man thinks: ‘I have not done what is evil, I have not done
what is cruel, I have not done what is wicked. I have done what is
good, I have done what is wholesome, I have made myself a shelter
from anguish. When I pass away, I shall go to the destination of
those who have not done what is evil … who have made themselves a
shelter from anguish.’ He does not sorrow, grieve, and lament, he
does not weep beating his breast and become distraught. This is the
third kind of pleasure and joy that a wise man feels here and now.</P>
<P  >31.
“A wise man who has given himself over to good conduct of body,
speech, and mind, [172] on the dissolution of the body, after death,
reappears in a happy destination, even in heaven.</P>
<H3 >(HEAVEN)</H3>
<P  >32.
“Were it rightly speaking to be said of anything: ‘That is
utterly wished for, utterly desired, utterly agreeable,’ it is of
heaven that, rightly speaking, this should be said, so much so that
it is hard to find a simile for the happiness of heaven.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, a bhikkhu asked the Blessed One: “But, venerable
sir, can a simile be given?”</P>
<P  >33.
“It can, bhikkhu,” the Blessed One said. “Bhikkhus, suppose
that a Wheel-turning Monarch<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1203anc" HREF="#sdendnote1203sym"><SUP>mcciii</SUP></A></SUP>
possessed the seven treasures and the four kinds of success, and
because of that experienced pleasure and joy.</P>
<P  >34.
“What are the seven treasures? Here, when a head-anointed noble
king has bathed his head on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1204anc" HREF="#sdendnote1204sym"><SUP>mcciv</SUP></A></SUP>
and has ascended to the upper palace chamber for the Uposatha, there
appears to him the divine wheel-treasure with its thousand spokes,
its tire, and its nave, complete in every aspect. On seeing it, the
head-anointed noble king thinks thus: ‘Now it has been heard by me
that when a head-anointed noble king has bathed his head on the
Uposatha day of the fifteenth and has ascended to the upper palace
chamber for the Uposatha, and there appears to him the divine
wheel-treasure with its thousand spokes, its tire, and its nave,
complete in every aspect, then that king becomes a Wheel-turning
Monarch. Am I then a Wheel-turning Monarch?’</P>
<P  >35.
“Then the head-anointed noble king rises from his seat, and taking
a water vessel in his left hand, he sprinkles the wheel-treasure with
his right hand, saying: ‘Turn forward, good wheel-treasure;
triumph, good wheel-treasure!’ Then the wheeltreasure turns forward
rolling in the eastern direction and the Wheel-turning Monarch
follows it with his four-constituent army. Now in whatever region the
wheel-treasure pauses, there the Wheel-turning Monarch takes up his
abode with his four-constituent army. And [173] opposing kings in the
eastern direction come to the Wheel-turning Monarch and speak thus:
‘Come, great king; welcome, great king; command, great king;
advise, great</P>
<P  >king.’
The Wheel-turning Monarch speaks thus: ‘You should not kill living
beings; you should not take what has not been given; you should not
misconduct yourselves in sensual pleasures; you should not speak
falsehood; you should not drink intoxicants; you should eat what you
are accustomed to eat.’ And the opposing kings in the eastern
direction submit to the Wheel-turning Monarch.</P>
<P  >“Then
the wheel-treasure plunges into the eastern ocean and emerges again.
And then it turns forward rolling in the southern direction … And
the opposing kings in the southern direction submit to the
Wheel-turning Monarch. Then the wheel-treasure plunges into the
southern ocean and emerges again. And then it turns forward rolling
in the western direction … And the opposing kings in the western
direction submit to the Wheel-turning Monarch. Then the
wheel-treasure plunges into the western ocean and emerges again. And
then it turns forward rolling in the northern direction … And the
opposing kings in the northern direction submit to the Wheel-turning
Monarch.</P>
<P  >“Now
when the wheel-treasure has triumphed over the earth to the ocean’s
edge, it returns to the royal capital and remains as if fixed on its
axle at the gate of the Wheel-turning Monarch’s inner palace, as an
adornment to the gate of his inner palace. Such is the wheel-treasure
that appears to a Wheel-turning Monarch.</P>
<P  >36.
“Again, the elephant-treasure appears to the Wheel-turning Monarch,
all white, with sevenfold stance, with supernormal power, flying
through the air, the king of elephants named ‘Uposatha.’ On
seeing him, the Wheel-turning Monarch’s mind has confidence in him
thus: ‘It would be wonderful to ride the elephant, if he would
undergo taming!’ Then the elephant-treasure [174] undergoes taming
just like a fine thoroughbred elephant well tamed for a long time.
And it so happens that the Wheel-turning Monarch, when testing the
elephant-treasure, mounts him in the morning, and after traversing
the whole earth to the edge of the ocean, he returns to the royal
capital to take his morning meal. Such is the elephant-treasure that
appears to a Wheel-turning Monarch.</P>
<P  >37.
“Again, the horse-treasure appears to the Wheel-turning Monarch,
all white, with raven-black head, with mane like munja grass, with
supernormal power, flying through the air, the king of horses named
‘Valahaka’ [‘Thundercloud’]. On seeing him,</P>
<P  >the
Wheel-turning Monarch’s mind has confidence in him thus: ‘It
would be wonderful to ride the horse, if he would undergo taming!’
Then the horse-treasure undergoes taming just like a fine
thoroughbred horse well tamed for a long time. And it so happens that
the Wheel-turning Monarch, when testing the horse-treasure, mounts
him in the morning, and after traversing the whole earth to the edge
of the ocean, he returns to the royal capital to take his morning
meal. Such is the horse-treasure that appears to a Wheel-turning
Monarch.</P>
<P  >38.
“Again, the jewel-treasure appears to the Wheel-turning Monarch.
The jewel is fine beryl of purest water, eight-faceted, and well cut.
Now the radiance of the jewel-treasure spreads around for a whole
league. And it so happens that when the Wheel-turning Monarch is
testing the jewel-treasure, he draws up his four-constituent army in
array, and mounting the jewel on top of his banner, he sets forth in
the darkness and gloom of the night. Then all the [inhabitants of
the] villages nearby begin their work by its light, thinking that it
is day. Such is the jeweltreasure that appears to a Wheel-turning
Monarch.</P>
<P  >39.
“Again, the woman-treasure appears to the Wheel-turning Monarch,
beautiful, comely and graceful, possessing the supreme beauty of
complexion, neither too tall nor too short, [175] neither too slim
nor too stout, neither too dark nor too fair, surpassing human beauty
without reaching divine beauty. The touch of the woman-treasure is
such that it is like a tuft of kapok or a tuft of cotton-wool. When
it is cool, her limbs are warm; when it is warm, her limbs are cool.
From her body the scent of sandalwood comes forth, and from her mouth
the scent of lotuses. She rises before the Wheel-turning Monarch and
retires after him. She is eager to serve, agreeable in conduct, and
sweet in speech. Since she is never unfaithful to the Wheel-turning
Monarch even in thought, how could she be so in body? Such is the
woman-treasure that appears to a Wheel-turning Monarch.</P>
<P  >40.
“Again, the steward-treasure appears to the Wheel-turning Monarch.
The divine eye born of past action is manifested in him whereby he
sees hidden stores of treasure both with owners and ownerless. He
approaches the Wheel-turning Monarch and says: ‘Sire, you remain at
ease. I shall take care of your monetary affairs.’ And it so
happens that when the Wheel-turning Monarch is testing the
steward-treasure, he boards a boat, and</P>
<P  >putting
out into the river Ganges, in midstream he tells the
steward-treasure: ‘I need gold and bullion, steward.’ - ‘Then,
sire, let the boat be steered towards one bank.’ - ‘Steward, it
is actually here that I need gold and bullion.’ Then the
stewardtreasure plunges both hands into the water and draws up a pot
full of gold and bullion, and he tells the Wheel-turning Monarch: ‘Is
this enough, sire? Is enough done, enough offered?’ - ‘This is
enough, steward, enough is done, enough offered.’ Such is the
steward-treasure that appears to a Wheel-turning Monarch.</P>
<P  >41.
“Again, the counsellor-treasure appears [176] to the Wheel-turning
Monarch, wise, shrewd, and sagacious, capable of getting the
Wheel-turning Monarch to promote that which is worthy of being
promoted, to dismiss that which should be dismissed, and to establish
that which should be established. He approaches the Wheel-turning
Monarch and says: ‘Sire, you remain at ease. I shall govern.’
Such is the counsellor-treasure that appears to a Wheel-turning
Monarch.</P>
<P  >“These
are the seven treasures that a Wheel-turning Monarch possesses.</P>
<P  >42.
“What are the four kinds of success? Here a Wheel-turning Monarch
is handsome, comely, and graceful, possessing the supreme beauty of
complexion, and he surpasses other human beings in that respect. This
is the first kind of success that a Wheel-turning Monarch possesses.</P>
<P  >43.
“Again, a Wheel-turning Monarch lives long and endures long, and he
surpasses other human beings in that respect. This is the second kind
of success that a Wheel-turning Monarch possesses.</P>
<P  >44.
“Again, a Wheel-turning Monarch is free from illness and
affliction, possessing a good digestion that is neither too cool nor
too warm, and he surpasses other human beings in that respect. This
is the third kind of success that a Wheel-turning Monarch possesses.</P>
<P  >45.
“Again, a Wheel-turning Monarch is dear and agreeable to brahmins
and householders. Just as a father is dear and agreeable to his
children, so too a Wheel-turning Monarch is dear and agreeable to
brahmins and householders. Brahmins and householders, too, are dear
and agreeable to a Wheel-turning Monarch. Just as children are dear
and agreeable to a father, so too brahmins and householders are dear
and agreeable to a</P>
<P  >Wheel-turning
Monarch. Once a Wheel-turning Monarch was driving in a pleasure park
with his four-constituent army. Then brahmins and householders went
to him and spoke thus: ‘Sire, drive slowly that we may see you
longer.’ And so he told his charioteer: [177] ‘Charioteer, drive
slowly that I may see the brahmins and householders longer.’ This
is the fourth kind of success that a Wheel-turning Monarch possesses.</P>
<P  >“These
are the four kinds of success that a Wheel-turning Monarch possesses.</P>
<P  >46.
“What do you think, bhikkhus? Would a Wheel-turning Monarch
experience pleasure and joy because of possessing these seven
treasures and these four kinds of success?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, a Wheel-turning Monarch would experience pleasure and joy
because of possessing even one treasure, let alone seven treasures
and four kinds of success.”</P>
<P  >47.
Then, taking a small stone the size of his hand, the Blessed One
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is
the greater, this small stone that I have taken, the size of my hand,
or Himalaya, the king of mountains?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, the small stone that the Blessed One has taken, the size of his
hand, does not count beside Himalaya, the king of mountains; it is
not even a fraction, there is no comparison.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, bhikkhus, the pleasure and joy that a Wheel-turning Monarch
would experience because of possessing the seven treasures and the
four kinds of success does not count beside the happiness of heaven;
it is not even a fraction, there is no comparison.</P>
<P  >48.
“If, some time or other, at the end of a long period, the wise man
comes back to the human state, it is into a high family that he is
reborn - into a family of well-to-do nobles, or well-todo brahmins,
or well-to-do householders - one that is rich, of great wealth, of
great possessions, with abundant gold and silver, with abundant
assets and means, and with abundant money and grain. He is handsome,
comely and graceful, possessing the supreme beauty of complexion. He
obtains food and drink, clothes, vehicles, garlands, scents and
unguents, bed, lodging, and light. He conducts himself well in body,
speech, and mind, [178] and having done so, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, he reappears in a happy destination, even in the

“Bhikkhus, suppose a gambler at the very first lucky throw won a

is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading131"  >
130. Devaduta Sutta - The Divine Messengers</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, suppose there were two houses with doors and a man with
good sight standing there between them saw people going in and coming
out and passing to and fro. So too, with the divine eye, which is
purified and surpasses the human, I see beings passing away and
reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and
unfortunate. I understand how beings pass on according to their
actions thus: ‘These worthy beings who were well-conducted in body,
speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views,
giving effect to right views in their actions, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, have reappeared in a happy destination, even
in the heavenly world. Or these worthy beings who were well-conducted
in body, speech, and mind, not [179] revilers of noble ones, right in
their views, giving effect to right views in their actions, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared among human
beings. But these worthy beings who were ill-conducted in body,
speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views,
giving effect to wrong views in their actions, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, have reappeared in the realm of ghosts. Or
these worthy beings who were ill-conducted … on the dissolution of
the body, after death, have reappeared in the animal world. Or these
worthy beings who were illconducted.. .on the dissolution of the
body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in an
unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.’</P>
<P  >3.
“Now the wardens of hell seize such a being by the arms and present
him to King Yama,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1206anc" HREF="#sdendnote1206sym"><SUP>mccvi</SUP></A></SUP>
saying: ‘Sire, this man has illtreated his mother, ill-treated his
father, ill-treated recluses, illtreated brahmins; he has had no
respect for the elders of his clan. Let the king order his
punishment.’</P>
<P  >4.
“Then King Yama presses and questions and cross-questions him about
the first divine messenger: ‘Good man, did you not see the first
divine messenger to appear in the world?’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1207anc" HREF="#sdendnote1207sym"><SUP>mccvii</SUP></A></SUP>
He says: ‘I did not, venerable sir.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good
man, have you never seen in the world a young tender infant lying
prone, fouled in his own excrement and urine?’ He says: ‘I have,
venerable sir.’</P>
<P  >“Then
King Yama says: ‘Good man, did it never occur to you - an
intelligent and mature man - “I too am subject to birth, I am not
exempt from birth: surely I had better do good by body, speech, and
mind”?’ He says: ‘I was unable, venerable sir, I was
negligent.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good man, through negligence
you have failed to do good by body, speech, and mind. Certainly they
will deal with you according to your negligence. But this evil action
of yours was not done by your mother or your father, [180] or by your
brother or your sister, or by your friends and companions, or by your
kinsmen and relatives, or by recluses and brahmins, or by gods: this
evil action was done by you yourself, and you yourself will

“Then, after pressing and questioning and cross-questioning him
about the first divine messenger, King Yama presses and questions and
cross-questions him about the second divine messenger: ‘Good man,
did you not see the second divine messenger to appear in the world?’
He says: ‘I did not, venerable sir.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good
man, have you never seen in the world a man - or a woman - at eighty,
ninety, or a hundred years, aged, as crooked as a roof bracket,
doubled up, supported by a walking stick, tottering, frail, youth
gone, teeth broken, grey-haired, scanty-haired, bald, wrinkled, with

about the second divine messenger, King Yama presses and questions
and cross-questions him about the third divine messenger: [181] ‘Good
man, did you not see the third divine messenger to appear in the
world?’ He says: ‘I did not, venerable sir.’ Then King Yama
says: ‘Good man, have you never seen in the world a man - or a
woman - afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill, lying fouled in his
own excrement and urine, lifted up by some and set down by others?’
He says: ‘I have, venerable sir.’</P>
<P  >“Then
King Yama says: ‘Good man, did it never occur to you - an
intelligent and mature man - “I too am subject to sickness, I am
not exempt from sickness: surely I had better do good by body,
speech, and mind”?’ He says: ‘I was unable, venerable sir, I
was negligent.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good man, through
negligence you have failed to do good by body, speech, and mind.
Certainly they will deal with you according to your negligence. But
this evil action of yours was not done by your mother … or by gods:
this evil action was done by you yourself, and you yourself will
experience its result.’</P>

“Then, after pressing and questioning and cross-questioning him

He says: ‘I did not, venerable sir.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good
man, have you never seen in the world, when a robber culprit is
caught, kings having many kinds of tortures inflicted on him: having
him flogged with whips … (as Sutta 129, §4) … and having his
head cut off with a sword?’ He says: ‘I have, venerable sir.’</P>
<P  >“Then
King Yama says: ‘Good man, did it never occur to you - an
intelligent and mature man - “Those who do evil actions have such
tortures of various kinds inflicted on them here and now; [182] so
what in the hereafter? Surely I had better do good by body, speech,
and mind”?’ He says: ‘I was unable, venerable sir, I was
negligent.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good man, through negligence
you have failed to do good by body, speech, and mind. Certainly they
will deal with you according to your negligence. But this evil action

“Then, after pressing and questioning and cross-questioning him
about the fourth divine messenger, King Yama presses and questions

man, did you not see the fifth divine messenger to appear in the
world?’ He says: ‘I did not, venerable sir.’ Then King Yama
says: ‘Good man, have you never seen in the world a man - or a
woman - one-day dead, two-days dead, three-days dead, bloated, livid,
and oozing with matter?’ He says: ‘I have, venerable sir.’</P>
<P  >“Then
King Yama says: ‘Good man, did it never occur to you - an
intelligent and mature man - “I too am subject to death, I am not

THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1209anc" HREF="#sdendnote1209sym"><SUP>mccix</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s
Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
“Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One
said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the summary and exposition of ‘One
Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1210anc" HREF="#sdendnote1210sym"><SUP>mccx</SUP></A></SUP>

has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in

form. He regards feeling as self … perception as self …
formations as self [189] … consciousness as self, or self as
possessed of consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as

presently arisen states.</P>

“And how, bhikkhus, is one invincible in regard to presently arisen

for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who
has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their
Dhamma, does not regard material form as self, or self as possessed
of material form, or material form as in self, or self as in material

“So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘Bhikkhus, I

Now on that occasion the venerable Ananda was instructing, urging,

in the assembly hall. He was reciting the summary and exposition of
“One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.”</P>
<P  >Then,
in the evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to the
assembly hall. He sat down on a seat made ready and asked the
bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, who has been instructing, urging, rousing, and
encouraging the bhikkhus with talk on the Dhamma in the assembly
hall? Who has been reciting the summary and exposition of ‘One Who

<P  >3-10.
“I was doing so thus, venerable sir: [191]</P>

133. Mahakaccanabhaddekaratta Sutta - Maha Kaccana<BR>and One
Fortunate Attachment</H2>
<P  >[192]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Park of the Hot Springs. Then., when it was near
dawn, the venerable Samiddhi went to the hot springs to bathe his
limbs. After bathing he came up out of the water and stood dressed in
one robe, drying his limbs. Then, when the night was well advanced, a
certain deity of beautiful appearance who illuminated the whole of
the Hot Springs, approached the venerable Samiddhi. Standing at one
side, the deity said to him:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhu, do you remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who
Has One Fortunate Attachment’?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
I do not remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has One
Fortunate Attachment.’ But, friend, do you remember the summary and
exposition of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment’?”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
I too do not remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has
One Fortunate Attachment.’ But, bhikkhu, do you remember the stanza
of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment’?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
I do not remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment.’ But, friend, do you remember the stanza of ‘One Who
Has One Fortunate Attachment’?”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
I too do not remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment.’ But, bhikkhu, learn the summary and exposition of ‘One
Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.’ Bhikkhu, master the summary and
exposition of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.’ Bhikkhu,
remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment.’</P>
<P  >Bhikkhu,
the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment’ is beneficial, it belongs to the fundamentals of the
holy life.”</P>
<P  >That
is what was said by the deity, who thereupon vanished at once.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when the night was over, the venerable Samiddhi went to the
Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side,
[193] told the Blessed One all that had occurred, and said: “It
would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me the
summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.’“</P>
<P  >4.
“Then, bhikkhu, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” -
“Yes, venerable sir,” the venerable Samiddhi replied. The Blessed
One said:</P>
<P  >5.
Let not a person revive the past</P>
<P >
Or on the future build his hopes;</P>
<P >
For the past has been left behind</P>
<P >
And the future has not been reached.</P>
<P >
Instead with insight let him see</P>
<P >
Each presently arisen state;</P>
<P >
Let him know that and be sure of it,</P>
<P >
Invincibly, unshakeably.</P>
<P >
Today the effort must be made;</P>
<P >
Tomorrow Death may come, who knows?</P>
<P >
No bargain with Mortality</P>
<P >
Can keep him and his hordes away.</P>
<P >
But one who dwells thus ardently,</P>
<P >
Relentlessly, by day, by night –</P>
<P >
It is he, the Peaceful Sage has said,</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment.”</P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >6.
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One
rose from his seat and went into his dwelling.</P>
<P  >7.
Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the bhikkhus considered:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1219anc" HREF="#sdendnote1219sym"><SUP>mccxix</SUP></A></SUP>
“Now, friends, the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone
into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding
the detailed meaning. Now who will expound this in detail?” [194]
Then they considered: “The venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the
Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life. He is
capable of expounding the detailed meaning. Suppose we went to him
and asked him the meaning of this.”</P>
<P  >8.
Then the bhikkhus went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, they sat down to one side and they told him what had taken
place, adding: “Let the venerable Maha Kaccana expound it to us.”</P>
<P  >9.
[The venerable Maha Kaccana replied:] “Friends, it is as though a
man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, [195] thought that heartwood should be sought for among
the branches and leaves of a great tree standing possessed of
heartwood, after he had passed over the root and the trunk. And so it
is with you, venerable sirs, that you think that I should be asked
about the meaning of this, after you passed the Blessed One by when
you were face to face with the Teacher. For knowing, the Blessed One
knows; seeing, he sees; he is vision, he is knowledge, he is the
Dhamma, he is the holy one; he is the sayer, the proclaimer, the
elucidator of meaning, the giver of the Deathless, the lord of the
Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the time when you should have asked
the Blessed One the meaning. As he told you, so you should have
remembered it.”</P>
<P  >10.
“Surely, friend Kaccana, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he
sees; he is vision … the Tathagata. That was the time when we
should have asked the Blessed One the meaning. As he told us, so we
should have remembered it. Yet the venerable Maha Kaccana is praised
by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life.
The venerable Maha Kaccana is capable of expounding the detailed
meaning of this summary given in brief by the Blessed One without
expounding the detailed meaning. Let the venerable Maha Kaccana
expound it without finding it troublesome.”</P>
<P  >11.
“Then listen, friends, and attend closely to what I shall say.” -
“Yes, friend,” the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Maha Kaccana
said this:</P>
<P  >12.
“Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his
dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the
detailed meaning, that is:</P>
<P >
‘Let not a person revive the past …</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment,’</P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >I
understand the detailed meaning of it to be as follows.</P>
<P  >13.
“How, friends, does one revive the past? [196] Thinking, ‘My eye
was thus in the past and forms were thus,’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1220anc" HREF="#sdendnote1220sym"><SUP>mccxx</SUP></A></SUP>
one’s consciousness becomes bound up with desire and lust for that.
Because one’s consciousness is bound up with desire and lust, one
delights in that. When one delights in that, one revives the past.</P>
<P  >“Thinking,
‘My ear was thus in the past and sounds were thus … My nose and
odours … My tongue and flavours … My body and tangibles … My
mind was thus in the past and mindobjects were thus,’ one’s
consciousness becomes bound up with desire and lust for that. Because
one’s consciousness is bound up with desire and lust, one delights
in that. When one delights in that, one revives the past. That is how
one revives the past.</P>
<P  >14.
“How does one not revive the past? Thinking, ‘My eye was thus in
the past and forms were thus,’ one’s consciousness does not
become bound up with desire and lust for that. Because one’s
consciousness is not bound up with desire and lust, one does not
delight in that. When one does not delight in that, one does not
revive the past.</P>
<P  >“Thinking,

odours … My tongue and flavours … My body and tangibles … My
mind was thus in the past and mindobjects were thus,’ one’s
consciousness does not become bound up with desire and lust for that.
Because one’s consciousness is not bound up with desire and lust,
one does not delight in that. When one does not delight in that, one
does not revive the past. That is how one does not revive the past.</P>
<P  >15.
“How, friends, does one build up hope upon the future? Thinking,
‘My eye may be thus in the future and forms may be thus,’ one
sets one’s heart on obtaining what has not yet been obtained.
Because one sets one’s heart thus, one delights in that. When one
delights in that, one builds up hope upon the future.</P>
<P  >“Thinking,
‘My ear may be thus in the future and sounds may be thus … My
nose and odours … My tongue and flavours … My body and tangibles
… My mind may be thus in the future and [197] mind-objects may be
thus,’ one sets one’s heart on obtaining what has not yet been
obtained. Because one sets one’s heart thus, one delights in that.
When one delights in that, one builds up hope upon the future. That
is how one builds up hope upon the future.</P>
<P  >16.
“How, friends, does one not build up hope upon the future?
Thinking, ‘My eye may be thus in the future and forms may be thus,’
one does not set one’s heart on obtaining what has not yet been
obtained. Because one does not set one’s heart thus, one does not
delight in that. When one does not delight in that, one does not
build up hope upon the future.</P>
<P  >“Thinking,
‘My ear may be thus in the future and sounds may be thus … My
nose and odours … My tongue and flavours … My body and tangibles
… My mind may be thus in the future and mind-objects may be thus,’
one does not set one’s heart on obtaining what has not yet been
obtained. Because one does not set one’s heart thus, one does not
delight in that. When one does not delight in that, one does not
build up hope upon the future. That is how one does not build up hope
upon the future.</P>
<P  >17.
“How is one vanquished in regard to presently arisen states? In
regard to the eye and forms that are presently arisen, one’s
consciousness is bound up with desire and lust for that which is
presently arisen. Because one’s consciousness is bound up with
desire and lust, one delights in that. When one delights in that, one
is vanquished in regard to presently arisen states.</P>
<P  >“In
regard to the ear and sounds that are presently arisen … the nose
and odours … the tongue and flavours … the body and tangibles …
the mind and mind-objects that are presently arisen, one’s
consciousness is bound up with desire and lust for that which is
presently arisen. Because one’s consciousness is bound up with
desire and lust, one delights in that. When one delights in that, one
is vanquished in regard to presently arisen states. That is how one
is vanquished in regard to presently arisen states.</P>
<P  >18.
“How is one invincible in regard to presently arisen states? In
regard to the eye and forms that are presently arisen, one’s
consciousness is not bound up with desire and lust for that which is
presently arisen. Because one’s consciousness is not bound up with
desire and lust, one does not delight in that. When one does not
delight in that, one is invincible in regard to presently arisen
states.</P>
<P  >“In

<P  >19.
“Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his
dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the
detailed meaning, that is:</P>
<P >
‘Let not a person revive the past …</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment,’</P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >I
understand the detailed meaning of this summary to be thus. Now,
friends, if you wish, go to the Blessed One and ask him about the
meaning of this. As the Blessed One explains it to you, so you should
remember it.”</P>
<P  >20.
Then the bhikkhus, having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable
Maha Kaccana’s words, rose from their seats and went to the Blessed
One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told
the Blessed One all that had taken place after he had left, adding:
[199] “Then, venerable sir, we went to the venerable Maha Kaccana
and asked him about the meaning. The venerable Maha Kaccana expounded
the meaning to us with these terms, statements, and phrases.”</P>
<P  >21.
“Maha Kaccana is wise, bhikkhus, Maha Kaccana has great wisdom. If
you had asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to
you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained it. Such is its
meaning, and so you should remember it.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading135"  >
134. Lomasakangiyabhaddekaratta Sutta - Lomasakangiya and One
Fortunate Attachment</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. Now on that
occasion the venerable Lomasakangiya was living in the Sakyan country
at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1221anc" HREF="#sdendnote1221sym"><SUP>mccxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Then, when the night was well advanced, Candana, a young deity of
beautiful appearance who illuminated the whole of Nigrodha’s Park,
approached the venerable Lomasakangiya. Standing at one side, Candana
the young deity said to him:</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
do you remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has One
Fortunate Attachment’?” [200]</P>
<P  >“Friend,
I do not remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has One
Fortunate Attachment.’ But, friend, do you remember the summary and
exposition of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment’?”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
I too do not remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has
One Fortunate Attachment.’ But, bhikkhu, do you remember the stanza
of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment’?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
I do not remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment.’ But, friend, do you remember the stanza of ‘One Who
Has One Fortunate Attachment’?”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
I remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.’“</P>
<P  >“But,
friend, in what way do you remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has One
Fortunate Attachment’?”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
once the Blessed One was living among the gods of the heaven of the
Thirty-three, on the Red Marble Stone at the root of the
Paricchattaka tree.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1222anc" HREF="#sdendnote1222sym"><SUP>mccxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
There the Blessed One recited the summary and exposition of ‘One
Who Has One Fortunate Attachment’ to the gods of the heaven of the
Thirty-three:</P>
<P  >3.
Let not a person revive the past</P>
<P >
Or on the future build his hopes;</P>
<P >
For the past has been left behind</P>
<P >
And the future has not been reached.</P>
<P >
Instead with insight let him see</P>
<P >
Each presently arisen state;</P>
<P >
Let him know that and be sure of it,</P>
<P >
Invincibly, unshakeably.</P>
<P >
Today the effort must be made;</P>
<P >
Tomorrow Death may come, who knows?</P>
<P >
No bargain with Mortality</P>
<P >
Can keep him and his hordes away.</P>
<P >
But one who dwells thus ardently,</P>
<P >
Relentlessly, by day, by night –</P>
<P >
It is he, the Peaceful Sage has said,</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment.’</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >4.
“Bhikkhu, I remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment’ thus. Bhikkhu, learn the summary and exposition of ‘One
Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.’ Bhikkhu, master the summary and
exposition of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.’ Bhikkhu,
remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment.’ Bhikkhu, the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has
One Fortunate Attachment’ is beneficial, it belongs to the
fundamentals of the holy life.”</P>
<P  >That
is what was said by Candana the young deity, who thereupon vanished
at once.</P>
<P  >5.
Then, when the night was over, the venerable Lomasakangiya set his
resting place in order, and taking his bowl and outer robe, set out
to wander by stages to Savatthi. He [201] at length arrived at
Savatthi, and went to the Blessed One in Jeta’s Grove,
Anathapindika’s Park. After paying homage to him, he sat down at
one side, told the Blessed One all that had occurred, and said: “It
would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me the
summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.’“</P>
<P  >6.
“Bhikkhu, do you know that young deity?” “No, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
that young deity is named Candana. He heeds the Dhamma, gives it
attention, engages it with all his mind, hears it with eager ears.
So, bhikkhu, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” the venerable Lomasakangiya replied to the Blessed
One. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >7-14.
“Let not a person revive the past …</P>
<P >
(Repeat the whole of Sutta 131, §§3-10 up to:) [202]</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The Venerable Lomasakangiya was
satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

135. Culakammavibhanga Sutta - The Shorter Exposition of Action</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatth-1 in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, went to the Blessed
One and exchanged greetings with him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1223anc" HREF="#sdendnote1223sym"><SUP>mccxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >3.
“Master Gotama, what is the cause and condition why human beings
are seen to be inferior and superior? For people are seen to be
short-lived and long-lived, sickly and healthy, ugly and beautiful,
uninfluential and influential, poor and wealthy, low-born and
high-born, stupid and [203] wise. What is the cause and condition,
Master Gotama, why human beings are seen to be inferior and
superior?”</P>
<P  >4.
“Student, beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their
actions; they originate from their actions, are bound to their
actions, have their actions as their refuge. It is action that
distinguishes beings as inferior and superior.”</P>
<P  >“I
do not understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotama’s
statement, which he spoke in brief without expounding the meaning in
detail. It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma
so that I might understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotama’s
statement.”</P>
<P  >“Then,
student, listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir,” the brahmin student Subha replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >5.
“Here, student, some man or woman kills living beings and is
murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to
living beings. Because of performing and undertaking such action, on
the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.
But if on the dissolution of the body, after death, he does not
reappear in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in
perdition, in hell, but instead comes back to the human state, then
wherever he is reborn he is shortlived.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1224anc" HREF="#sdendnote1224sym"><SUP>mccxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the way, student, that leads to short life, namely, one kills
living being and is murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and
violence, merciless to living beings.</P>
<P  >6.
“But here, student, some man or woman, abandoning the killing of
living beings, abstains from killing living beings; with rod and
weapon laid aside, gentle and kindly, he abides compassionate to all
living beings. Because of performing and undertaking such action, on
the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world. But if on the dissolution of
the body, after death, he does not reappear in a happy destination,

then wherever he is reborn he is long-lived.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1225anc" HREF="#sdendnote1225sym"><SUP>mccxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the way, student, that leads to long life, namely, abandoning
the killing of living beings, [204] one abstains from killing living
beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gentle and kindly, one abides
compassionate to all living beings.</P>
<P  >7.
“Here, student, some man or woman is given to injuring beings with
the hand, with a clod, with a stick, or with a knife. Because of
performing and undertaking such action, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, he reappears in a state of deprivation … But if
instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn
he is sickly. This is the way, student, that leads to sickliness,
namely, one is given to injuring beings with the hand, with a clod,
with a stick, or with a knife.</P>
<P  >8.
“But here, student, some man or woman is not given to injuring
beings with the hand, with a clod, with a stick, or with a knife.
Because of performing and undertaking such action, on the dissolution
of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy destination … But

<P  >9.
“Here, student, some man or woman is of an angry and irritable
character; even when criticised a little, he is offended, becomes
angry, hostile, and resentful, and displays anger, hate, and
bitterness. Because of performing and undertaking such action … he
reappears in a state of deprivation … But if instead he comes back
to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is ugly. This is

and undertaking such action … he reappears in a state of

Because of performing and undertaking such action … he reappears in

“Thus, student, the way that leads to short life makes people
short-lived, the way that leads to long life makes people long-lived;

distinguishes beings as inferior and superior.”</P>
<P  >21.
When this was said, the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, said
to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent,
Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways,
as though he were turning upright what had been overturned, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a
lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master
Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus.
Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
for refuge for life.”</P>
<H2 NAME="Heading137"  >
136. Mahakammavibhanga Sutta - The Greater Exposition of Action</H2>
<P  >[207]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Samiddhi was living in a forest
hut. Then the wanderer Potaliputta, while wandering and walking for
exercise, went to the venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings with
him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down
at one side and said to the venerable Samiddhi:</P>
<P  >“Friend
Samiddhi, I heard and learned this from the recluse Gotama’s own
lips: ‘Bodily action is vain, verbal action is vain, only r ental
action is real.’ And: ‘There is that attainment on ente ig which
one does not feel anything at all.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1226anc" HREF="#sdendnote1226sym"><SUP>mccxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Do
not say so, friend Potaliputta, do not say so. Do not misrepresent
the Blessed One; it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The
Blessed One would not speak thus: ‘Bodily action is vain, verbal
action is vain, only mental action is real.’ But, friend, there is
that attainment on entering which one does not feel anything at all.”</P>
<P  >“How
long is it since you went forth, friend Samiddhi?” “Not long,
friend: three years.”</P>
<P  >“There
now, what shall we say to the elder bhikkhus when a young bhikkhu
thinks the Teacher is to be defended thus? Friend Samiddhi, having
done an intentional action by way of body, speech, or mind, what does
one feel?”</P>
<P  >“Having
done an intentional action by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels
suffering, friend Potaliputta.”</P>
<P  >Then,
neither approving nor disapproving of the venerable Samiddhi’s
words, the wanderer Potaliputta rose from his seat and departed.</P>
<P  >3.
Soon after the wanderer Potaliputta had left, the venerable Samiddhi
went to the venerable Ananda [208] and exchanged greetings with him.
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and reported to the venerable Ananda his entire conversation
with the wanderer Potaliputta. After he had spoken, the venerable
Ananda told him: “Friend Samiddhi, this conversation should be told
to the Blessed One. Come, let us approach the Blessed One and tell
him this. As the Blessed One explains to us, so we shall bear it in
mind.” - “Yes, friend,” the venerable Samiddhi replied.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the venerable Ananda and the venerable Samiddhi went together to
the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one
side. The venerable Ananda reported</P>
<P  >to
the Blessed One the entire conversation between the venerable
Samiddhi and the wanderer Potaliputta.</P>
<P  >5.
When he had finished, the Blessed One told the venerable Ananda:
“Ananda, I do not even recall ever having seen the wanderer
Potaliputta, so how could there have been this conversation? Though
the wanderer Potaliputta’s question should have been analysed
before being answered, this misguided man answered it one-sidedly.”</P>
<P  >6.
When this was said, the venerable Udayin said to the Blessed One:
“Venerable sir, perhaps the venerable Samiddhi spoke thus referring
to [the principle]: ‘Whatever is felt is suffering.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1227anc" HREF="#sdendnote1227sym"><SUP>mccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda: “See, Ananda, how
this misguided man Udayin interferes. I knew, Ananda, that this
misguided man Udayin would unduly interfere right now. From the start
the wanderer Potaliputta had asked about the three kinds of feeling.
This misguided man Samiddhi [209] would have answered the wanderer
Potaliputta rightly if, when asked thus, he would have explained:
‘Friend Potaliputta, having done an intentional action by way of
body, speech, or mind [whose result is] to be felt as pleasant, one

“The six internal bases should be understood. The six external
bases should be understood. The six classes of consciousness should

“Furthermore, bhikkhus, compassionate and seeking their welfare,
the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of compassion:
‘This is for your welfare; this is for your happiness.’ Some of
his disciples will not hear or give ear or exert their minds to
understand; they err and turn aside from the Teacher’s
Dispensation. Some of his disciples will hear and give ear and exert
their minds to understand; they do not err and turn aside from the
Teacher’s Dispensation. With that the Tathagata is not satisfied
and feels no satisfaction, and he is not dissatisfied and feels no
dissatisfaction; remaining free from both satisfaction and
dissatisfaction, he dwells in equanimity, mindful, and fully aware.
This, bhikkhus, is called the second foundation of mindfulness that
the Noble One cultivates, cultivating which the Noble One is a

non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is

138. Uddesavibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of a Summary</H2>
<P  >[223]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There the Blessed
One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a summary and an exposition. Listen
and attend closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes, venerable sir,”
the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should examine things in such a way that while
he is examining them, his consciousness is not distracted and
scattered externally nor stuck internally, and by not clinging he
does not become agitated. If his consciousness is not distracted and
scattered externally nor stuck internally, and if by not clinging he
does not become agitated, then for him there is no origination of
suffering - of birth, ageing, and death in the future.”</P>
<P  >4.
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One
rose from his seat and went into his dwelling.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1249anc" HREF="#sdendnote1249sym"><SUP>mccxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the bhikkhus considered:
“Now, friends, the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone
into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding
the detailed meaning. Now who will expound this in detail?” Then
they considered: “The venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the
Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life. He is
capable of expounding the detailed meaning. Suppose we went to him
and asked him the meaning of this.”</P>
<P  >6-8.
[224, 225] (As at Sutta 133, §§8-10.)</P>
<P  >9.
“Then listen, friends, and attend closely to what I shall say.”
“Yes, friend,” the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Maha</P>
<P  >Kaccana
said this:</P>

“One should not pursue sensual pleasure, which is low, vulgar,
coarse, ignoble, and unbeneficial; and one should not pursue

One should know what it is to extol and what it is to disparage, and

there are these five cords of sensual pleasure. What five? Forms
cognizable by the eye … sounds cognizable by the ear … odours
cognizable by the nose … flavours cognizable by the tongue …
tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.
Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of
sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasure - a filthy pleasure, a
coarse pleasure, an ignoble pleasure. I say of this kind of pleasure
that it should not be pursued, that it should not be developed, that
it should not be cultivated, and that it should be feared.</P>
<P  >“Here,

localities they call the same thing a ‘dish’ … or a ‘basin.’
So whatever they call it in such and such a locality, without
adhering [to that expression] one speaks accordingly, thinking:
‘These venerable ones, it seems, are speaking with reference to
this.’ This is how there comes to be noninsistence on local
language and non-overriding of normal usage.</P>
<P  >“So
it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘One should not
insist on local language, and one should not override normal usage.’</P>

“Here, bhikkhus, the pursuit of the enjoyment of one whose pleasure

“Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘We shall

140. Dhatuvibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of the Elements</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Magadhan country and eventually arrived at Rajagaha. There he
went to the potter Bhaggava and said to him:</P>
<P  >2.
“If it is not inconvenient for you, Bhaggava, I will stay one night
in your workshop.”</P>
<P  >“It
is not inconvenient for me, venerable sir, but there is a homeless
one already staying there. If he agrees, then stay as long as you
like, venerable sir.” [238]</P>
<P  >3.
Now there was a clansman named Pukkusati who had gone forth from the
home life into homelessness out of faith in the Blessed One, and on
that occasion he was already staying in the potter’s workshop.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1264anc" HREF="#sdendnote1264sym"><SUP>mcclxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the Blessed One went to the venerable Pukkusati and said to him:
“If it is not inconvenient for you, bhikkhu, I will stay one night
in the workshop.”</P>
<P  >“The
potter’s workshop is large enough, friend.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1265anc" HREF="#sdendnote1265sym"><SUP>mcclxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Let the venerable one stay as long as he likes.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One entered the potter’s workshop, prepared a
spread of grass at one end, and sat down, folding his legs crosswise,
setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness in front of him.
Then the Blessed One spent most of the night seated [in meditation],
and the venerable Pukkusati also spent most of the night seated [in
meditation]. Then the Blessed One thought: “This clansman conducts
himself in a way that inspires confidence. Suppose I were to question
him.” So he asked the venerable Pukkusati:</P>
<P  >5.
“Under whom have you gone forth, bhikkhu? Who is your teacher?
Whose Dhamma do you profess?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1266anc" HREF="#sdendnote1266sym"><SUP>mcclxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Friend,
there is the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth
from a Sakyan clan. Now a good report of that Blessed Gotama has been
spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed One</P>
<P  >is
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’ I have
gone forth under that Blessed One; that Blessed One is my teacher; I
profess the Dhamma of that Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >“But,
bhikkhu, where is that Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened, now living?”</P>
<P  >“There
is, friend, a city in the northern country named Savatth-1. The
Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, is now living
there.”</P>
<P  >“But,
bhikkhu, have you ever seen that Blessed One before? Would you
recognise him if you saw him?” [239]</P>
<P  >“No,
friend, I have never seen that Blessed One before, nor would I
recognise him if I saw him.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then the Blessed One thought: “This clansman has gone forth from
the home life into homelessness under me. Suppose I were to teach him
the Dhamma.” So the Blessed One addressed the venerable Pukkusati
thus: “Bhikkhu, I will teach you the Dhamma. Listen and attend
closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes, friend,” the venerable
Pukkusati replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>

The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these

him he is called a sage at peace. One should not neglect wisdom,
should preserve truth, should cultivate relinquishment, and should
train for peace. This is the summary of the exposition of the six

So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? On seeing a
form with the eye, one explores a form productive of joy, one
explores a form productive of grief, one explores a form productive
of equanimity. On hearing a sound with the ear … [240] On smelling
an odour with the nose … On tasting a flavour with the tongue …
On touching a tangible with the body … On cognizing a mind-object
with the mind, one explores a mind-object productive of joy, one

“How, bhikkhu, does one not neglect wisdom?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1272anc" HREF="#sdendnote1272sym"><SUP>mcclxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
There are these six elements: the earth element, the water element,
the fire element, the air element, the space element, and the
consciousness element.</P>
<P  >14.
“What, bhikkhu, is the earth element? The earth element may be
either internal or external. What is the internal earth element?
Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, and
clung-to, that is, head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,
sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen,
lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach,
feces, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is solid,
solidified, and clung-to: this is called the internal earth element.
Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element
are simply earth element. And that should be seen as it actually is
with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is
not my self.’ When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the earth element and makes the
mind dispassionate towards the earth element.</P>
<P  >15.
“What, bhikkhu, is the water element? The water element may be
either [241] internal or external. What is the internal water
element? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery,
and clung-to, that is, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears,
grease, spittle, snot, oil-of-the-joints, urine, or whatever else
internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and clung-to:
this is called the internal water element. Now both the internal
water element and the external water element are simply water
element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom

When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one

dispassionate towards the water element.</P>
<P  >16.
“What, bhikkhu, is the fire element? The fire element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal fire element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and, clung-to, that
is, that by which one is warmed, ages, and is consumed, and that by
which what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets completely
digested, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is fire,
fiery, and clung-to: this is called the internal fire element. Now
both the internal fire element and the external fire element are
simply fire element. And that should be seen as it actually is with
proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not
my self.’ When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the fire element and makes the
mind dispassionate towards the fire element.</P>

“What, bhikkhu, is the air element? The air element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal air element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clungto, that is,
up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the belly, winds in the
bowels, winds that course through the limbs, in-breath and
out-breath, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is
air, airy, and clung-to: this is called the internal air element. Now
both the internal air element and the external air element are simply
air element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper
wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my
self.’ When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom,
one becomes disenchanted with the air element and makes the mind
dispassionate towards the air element.</P>
<P  >18.
“What, bhikkhu, is the space element? The space element may be
either internal or external. What is the internal [242] space
element? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is space,
spatial, and clung-to, that is, the holes of the ears, the nostrils,
the door of the mouth, and that [aperture] whereby what is eaten,
drunk, consumed, and tasted gets swallowed, and where it collects,
and whereby it is excreted from below, or whatever else internally,
belonging to oneself, is space, spatial, and clung-to: this is called
the internal space element. Now both the internal space element and
the external space element are simply space element. And that should
be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not
mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ When one sees it thus as

“Then there remains only consciousness, purified and bright.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1273anc" HREF="#sdendnote1273sym"><SUP>mcclxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
What does one cognize with that consciousness? One cognizes: ‘[This
is] pleasant’; one cognizes: ‘[This is] painful’; one cognizes:
‘[This is] neither-painful-nor-pleasant.’ In dependence on a
contact to be felt as pleasant there arises a pleasant feeling.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1274anc" HREF="#sdendnote1274sym"><SUP>mcclxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
When one feels a pleasant feeling, one understands: ‘I feel a
pleasant feeling.’ One understands: ‘With the cessation of that
same contact to be felt as pleasant, its corresponding feeling - the
pleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt
as pleasant - ceases and subsides.’ In dependence on a contact to
be felt as painful there arises a painful feeling. When one feels a
painful feeling, one understands: ‘I feel a painful feeling.’ One
understands: ‘With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as
painful, its corresponding feeling - the painful feeling that arose
in dependence on that contact to be felt as painful - ceases and

cessation of that same contact to be felt as
neither-painfulnor-pleasant, its corresponding feeling - the
neither-painfulnor-pleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that
contact to be felt as neither-painful-nor-pleasant - ceases and
subsides.’ Bhikkhu, just as from the contact and friction of two
fire-sticks</P>
<P  >heat
is generated and fire is produced, and with the separation and
disjunction of these two fire-sticks the corresponding heat ceases
and subsides; so too, [243] in dependence on a contact to be felt as
pleasant … to be felt as painful … to be felt as
neitherpainful-nor-pleasant there arises a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling … One understands: ‘With the

malleable, wieldy, and radiant.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1275anc" HREF="#sdendnote1275sym"><SUP>mcclxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Suppose, bhikkhu, a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice were to
prepare a furnace, heat up the crucible, take some gold with tongs,
and put it into the crucible. From time to time he would blow on it,
from time to time he would sprinkle water over it, and from time to

refined, completely refined, faultless, rid of dross, malleable,
wieldy, and radiant. Then whatever kind of ornament he wished to make
from it, whether a golden chain or earrings or a necklace or a golden
garland, it would serve his purpose. So too, bhikkhu, then there
remains only equanimity, purified and bright, malleable, wieldy, and
radiant.</P>
<P  >21.
“He understands thus: ‘If I were to direct this equanimity, so
purified and bright, to the base of infinite space and to develop my

base, clinging to it, would remain for a very long time.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1276anc" HREF="#sdendnote1276sym"><SUP>mcclxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>

If I were to direct this equanimity, so purified and bright, to the

condition or generate any volition tending towards either being or
non-being.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1278anc" HREF="#sdendnote1278sym"><SUP>mcclxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Since he does not form any condition or generate any volition tending
towards either being or non-being, he does not cling to anything in
this world. When he does not cling, he is not agitated. When he is
not agitated, he personally attains Nibbana. He understands thus:

done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1279anc" HREF="#sdendnote1279sym"><SUP>mcclxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>

“If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels

terminating with life, he understands: ‘I feel a feeling

Bhikkhu, just as an oil-lamp burns in dependence on oil and a wick,

“Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced covetousness,

Conceiving is a disease, conceiving is a tumour, conceiving is a

Thereupon the venerable Pukkusati thought: “Indeed, the Teacher has

<P  >“Venerable
sir, my bowl and robes are not complete.”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhu,
Tathagatas do not give the full admission to anyone whose bowl and
robes are not complete.”</P>
<P  >35.
Then the venerable Pukkusati, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One’s words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to
the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed in order to
search for a bowl and robes. Then, while the venerable Pukkusati was
searching for a bowl and robes, a stray cow killed him.</P>
<P  >36.
Then a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him: “Venerable
sir, the clansman Pukkusati, who was given</P>
<P  >brief
instruction by the Blessed One, has died. What is his destination?
What is his future course?”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhus,
the clansman Pukkusati was wise. He practised in accordance with the
Dhamma and did not trouble me in the interpretation of the Dhamma.
With the destruction of the five lower fetters, the clansman
Pukkusati has reappeared spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and will
attain final Nibbana there without ever returning from that world.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1287anc" HREF="#sdendnote1287sym"><SUP>mcclxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

141. Saccavibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of the Truths</H2>
<P  >[248]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There he addressed the
bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“At Benares, bhikkhus, in the Deer Park at Isipatana the Tathagata,
accomplished and fully enlightened, set rolling the matchless Wheel
of the Dhamma,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1288anc" HREF="#sdendnote1288sym"><SUP>mcclxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
which cannot be stopped by any recluse or brahmin or god or Mara or
Brahma or anyone in the world - that is, the announcing, teaching,
describing, establishing, revealing, expounding, and exhibiting of
the Four Noble Truths. Of what four?</P>
<P  >3.
“The announcing, teaching, describing, establishing, revealing,
expounding, and exhibiting of the noble truth of suffering. The
announcing, teaching, describing, establishing, revealing,
expounding, and exhibiting of the noble truth of the origin of
suffering … of the noble truth of the cessation of suffering … of
the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</P>
<P  >4.
“At Benares, bhikkhus, in the Deer Park at Isipatana the Tathagata,
accomplished and fully enlightened, set rolling the matchless Wheel
of the Dhamma, which cannot be stopped by any recluse or brahmin or
god or Mara or Brahma or anyone in the world - that is, the
announcing, teaching, describing, establishing, revealing,
expounding, and exhibiting of these Four Noble Truths.</P>
<P  >5.
“Cultivate the friendship of Sariputta and Moggallana, bhikkhus;
associate with Sariputta and Moggallana. They are wise and helpful to
their companions in the holy life. Sariputta is like a mother;
Moggallana is like a nurse. Sariputta trains others for the fruit of
stream-entry, Moggallana for the supreme goal.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1289anc" HREF="#sdendnote1289sym"><SUP>mcclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Sariputta, bhikkhus, is able to announce, teach, describe, establish,
reveal, expound, and exhibit the Four Noble Truths.”</P>
<P  >6.
So the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One rose from
his seat and went into his dwelling. [249]</P>
<P  >7.
Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the venerable Sariputta
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Friends, bhikkhus.” - “Friend,”
the bhikkhus replied to the venerable Sariputta. The venerable
Sariputta said this:</P>
<P  >8.
“At Benares, friends, in the Deer Park at Isipatana the Tathagata,
accomplished and fully enlightened, set rolling the matchless Wheel
of the Dhamma … and exhibiting of the Four Noble Truths. Of what
four?</P>
<P  >9.
“The announcing … and exhibiting of the noble truth of suffering
… of the noble truth of the origin of suffering … of the noble
truth of the cessation of suffering … of the noble truth of the way
leading to the cessation of suffering.</P>
<P  >10.
“And what, friends, is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is
suffering; ageing is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering; not to obtain
what one wants is suffering; in short, the five aggregates affected
by clinging are suffering.</P>
<P  >11.
“And what, friends, is birth?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1290anc" HREF="#sdendnote1290sym"><SUP>mccxc</SUP></A></SUP>
The birth of beings into the various orders of beings, their coming
to birth, precipitation [in a womb], generation, the manifestation of
the aggregates, obtaining the bases for contact - this is called
birth.</P>
<P  >12.
“And what, friends, is ageing? The ageing of beings in the various
orders of beings, their old age, brokenness of teeth, greyness of
hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of life, weakness of faculties -
this is called ageing.</P>
<P  >13.
“And what, friends, is death? The passing of beings out of the
various orders of beings, their passing away, dissolution,
disappearance, dying, completion of time, dissolution of aggregates,
laying down of the body - this is called death.</P>
<P  >14.
“And what, friends, is sorrow? The sorrow, sorrowing,
sorrowfulness, inner sorrow, inner sorriness, of one who has
encountered some misfortune or is affected by some painful state -
this is called sorrow.</P>
<P  >15.
“And what, friends, is lamentation? The wail and lament, wailing
and lamenting, [250] bewailing and lamentation, of one who has
encountered some misfortune or is affected by some painful state -
this is called lamentation.</P>
<P  >16.
“And what, friends, is pain? Bodily pain, bodily discomfort,
painful, uncomfortable feeling born of bodily contact - this is
called pain.</P>
<P  >17.
“And what, friends, is grief? Mental pain, mental discomfort,
painful, uncomfortable feeling born of mental contact - this is
called grief.</P>
<P  >18.
“And what, friends, is despair? The trouble and despair, the
tribulation and desperation, of one who has encountered some
misfortune or is affected by some painful state - this is called
despair.</P>
<P  >19.
“And what, friends, is ‘not to obtain what one wants is
suffering’? To beings subject to birth there comes the wish: ‘Oh,
that we were not subject to birth! That birth would not come to us!’
But this is not to be obtained by wishing, and not to obtain what one
wants is suffering. To beings subject to ageing. . .subject to
sickness … subject to death … subject to sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair, there comes the wish: ‘Oh, that we were
not subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair! That
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair would not come to us!’
But this is not to be obtained by wishing, and not to obtain what one
wants is suffering.</P>
<P  >20.
“And what, friends, are the five aggregates affected by clinging
that, in short, are suffering? They are: the material form aggregate
affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the
perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate
affected by clinging, and the consciousness aggregate affected by
clinging. These are the five aggregates affected by clinging that, in
short, are suffering. This is called the noble truth of suffering.</P>
<P  >21.
“And what, friends, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering?
It is craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by
delight and lust, and delights in this and that; that is, craving for
sensual pleasures, craving for being, [251] and craving for
non-being. This is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering.</P>
<P  >22.
“And what, friends, is the noble truth of the cessation of
suffering? It is the remainderless fading away and ceasing, the
giving up, relinquishing, letting go, and rejecting of that same
craving. This is called the noble truth of the cessation of
suffering.</P>
<P  >23.
“And what, friends, is the noble truth of the way leading to the
cessation of suffering? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that
is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</P>
<P  >24.
“And what, friends, is right view? Knowledge of suffering,
knowledge of the origin of suffering, knowledge of the cessation of
suffering, and knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering - this is called right view.</P>
<P  >25.
“And what, friends, is right intention? Intention of renunciation,
intention of non-ill will, and intention of non-cruelty - this is
called right intention.</P>
<P  >26.
“And what, friends, is right speech? Abstaining from false speech,
abstaining from malicious speech, abstaining from harsh speech, and
abstaining from idle chatter - this is called right speech.</P>
<P  >27.
“And what, friends, is right action? Abstaining from killing living
beings, abstaining from taking what is not given, and abstaining from
misconduct in sensual pleasures - this is called right action.</P>
<P  >28.
“And what, friends, is right livelihood? Here a noble disciple,
having abandoned wrong livelihood, earns his living by right
livelihood - this is called right livelihood.</P>
<P  >29.
“And what, friends, is right effort? Here a bhikkhu awakens zeal
for the non-arising of unarisen evil unwholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. He awakens zeal
for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. He awakens zeal
for the arising of unarisen wholesome states, [252] and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. He awakens zeal
for the continuance, non-disappearance, strengthening, increase, and
fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. This is called
right effort.</P>
<P  >30.
“And what, friends, is right mindfulness? Here a bhikkhu abides
contemplating the body as a body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful,
having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides
contemplating feelings as feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful,
having put away covetousness and</P>
<P  >grief
for the world. He abides contemplating mind as mind, ardent, fully
aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the
world. He abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent,
fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for
the world. This is called right mindfulness.</P>
<P  >31.
“And what, friends, is right concentration? Here, quite secluded
from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu
enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by
applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion. With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he
enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has self-confidence
and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of concentration. With the fading away as
well of rapture, he abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully
aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and
abides in the third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce:
‘He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’
With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous
disappearance of joy and grief, he enters upon and abides in the
fourth jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of
mindfulness due to equanimity. This is called right concentration.</P>
<P  >“This
is called the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.</P>
<P  >32.
“At Benares, friends, in the Deer Park at Isipatana the Tathagata,
accomplished and fully enlightened, set rolling the matchless Wheel
of the Dhamma, which cannot be stopped by any recluse or brahmin or
god or Mara or Brahma or anyone in the world - that is, the
announcing, teaching, describing, establishing, revealing,
expounding, and exhibiting of these Four Noble Truths.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the venerable Sariputta said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the venerable Sariputta’s words.</P>

142. Dakkhinavibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of Offerings</H2>
<P  >[253]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Mahapajapati Gotami took a new pair of cloths and went to the
Blessed One.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1291anc" HREF="#sdendnote1291sym"><SUP>mccxci</SUP></A></SUP>
After paying homage to him, she sat down at one side and said to the
Blessed One: “Venerable sir, this new pair of cloths has been spun
by me, woven by me, especially for the Blessed One. Venerable sir,
let the Blessed One accept it from me out of compassion.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the Blessed One told her: “Give it to the Sangha,
Gotami. When you give it to the Sangha, the offering will be made
both to me and to the Sangha.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1292anc" HREF="#sdendnote1292sym"><SUP>mccxcii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >A
second time and a third time she said to the Blessed One: “Venerable
sir, … accept it from me out of compassion.”</P>
<P  >A
second time and a third time the Blessed One told her: “Give it to
the Sangha, Gotami. When you give it to the Sangha, the offering will
be made both to me and to the Sangha.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir,
let the Blessed One accept the new pair of cloths from Mahapajapati
Gotami. Mahapajapati Gotami has been very helpful to the Blessed One,
venerable sir. As his mother’s sister, she was his nurse, his
foster mother, the one who gave him milk. She suckled the Blessed One
when his own mother died. The Blessed One too has been very helpful
to Mahapajapati Gotami, venerable sir. It is owing to the Blessed One
that Mahapajapati Gotami has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the
Dhamma, and the Sangha. It is owing to the Blessed One that
Mahapajapati Gotami abstains from killing living beings, from taking
what is not given, from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from false
speech, and from wine, liquor, and intoxicants, which are the basis
of negligence. It is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati
Gotami possesses perfect confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and
the Sangha, and that she possesses [254] the virtues loved by noble
ones.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1293anc" HREF="#sdendnote1293sym"><SUP>mccxciii</SUP></A></SUP>
It is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati Gotami is free from
doubt about suffering, about the origin of suffering, about the
cessation of suffering, and about the way leading to the cessation of
suffering. The Blessed One has been very helpful to Mahapajapati
Gotami.”</P>
<P  >4.
“That is so, Ananda, that is so! When one person, owing to another,
has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, I say
that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying
homage to him, rising up for him, according him reverential
salutation and polite services, and by providing robes, almsfood,
resting places, and medicinal requisites.</P>
<P  >“When

beings, from taking what is not given, from misconduct in sensual
pleasures, from false speech, and from wine, liquor, and intoxicants,

former to repay the latter by paying homage to him … and medicinal
requisites.</P>
<P  >“When
one person, owing to another, has come to possess perfect confidence

“There are fourteen kinds of personal offerings, Ananda.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1294anc" HREF="#sdendnote1294sym"><SUP>mccxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
One gives a gift to the Tathagata, accomplished and fully

gift to a paccekabuddha; this is the second kind of personal
offering. One gives a gift to an arahant disciple of the Tathagata;
this is the third kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to one
who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of
arahantship; this is the fourth kind of personal offering. One gives
a gift to a non-returner; this is the fifth kind of personal
offering. [255] One gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way
to the realisation of the fruit of non-return; this is the sixth kind
of personal offering. One gives a gift to a once-returner; this is

has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of
once-return; this is the eighth kind of personal offering. One gives
a gift to a stream-enterer; this is the ninth kind of personal

realisation of the fruit of stream-entry;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1295anc" HREF="#sdendnote1295sym"><SUP>mccxcv</SUP></A></SUP>

outside [the Dispensation] who is free from lust for sensual
pleasures;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1296anc" HREF="#sdendnote1296sym"><SUP>mccxcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the eleventh kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to a
virtuous ordinary person; this is the twelfth kind of personal
offering. One gives a gift to an immoral ordinary person; this is the
thirteenth kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to an animal;
this is the fourteenth kind of personal offering.</P>
<P  >6.
“Herein, Ananda, by giving a gift to an animal, the offering may be
expected to repay a hundredfold.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1297anc" HREF="#sdendnote1297sym"><SUP>mccxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
By giving a gift to an immoral ordinary person, the offering may be
expected to repay a thousandfold. By giving a gift to a virtuous
ordinary person, the offering may be expected to repay a
hundred-thousandfold. By giving a gift to one outside [the
Dispensation] who is free from lust for sensual pleasures, the
offering may be expected to repay a hundred-thousand times a
hundred-thousandfold.</P>
<P  >“By
giving a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation
of the fruit of stream-entry, the offering may be expected to repay
incalculably, immeasurably. What, then, should be said about giving a
gift to a stream-enterer? What should be said about giving a gift to
one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of
once-return … to a once-returner … to one who has entered upon
the way to the realisation of the fruit of non-return … to a
non-returner … to one who has entered upon the way to the
realisation of the fruit of arahantship … to an arahant … to a

Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1298anc" HREF="#sdendnote1298sym"><SUP>mccxcviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >7.
“There are seven kinds of offerings made to the Sangha, Ananda. One
gives a gift to a Sangha of both [bhikkhus and bhikkhunis] headed by
the Buddha; this is the first kind of offering made to the Sangha.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1299anc" HREF="#sdendnote1299sym"><SUP>mccxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
One gives a gift to a Sangha of both [bhikkhus and bhikkhunis] after

<P  >One
gives a gift to a Sangha of bhikkhus; this is the third kind of
offering made to the Sangha. One gives a gift to a Sangha of
bhikkhunis; this is the fourth kind of offering made to the Sangha.
One gives a gift, saying: ‘Appoint so many bhikkhus and bhikkhunis
for me from the Sangha’; [256] this is the fifth kind of offering
made to the Sangha. One gives a gift, saying: ‘Appoint so many
bhikkhus for me from the Sangha’; this is the sixth kind of

“And what is the offering that is purified by the receiver, not by

“And what is the offering that is purified neither by the giver nor

<P  >13.
“And what is the offering that is purified both by the giver and by

receiver is virtuous, of good character. [257] Thus the offering is
purified both by the giver and by the receiver. These are the four
kinds of purification of offering.”</P>

That is what the Blessed One said. When the Sublime One had said
that, the Teacher said further:</P>
<P >
“When a virtuous person to an immoral person gives</P>
<P >
With trusting heart a gift righteously obtained,</P>

143. Anathapindikovada Sutta - Advice to Anathapindika</H2>
<P  >[258]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the householder Anathapindika was afflicted,
suffering, and gravely ill. Then he addressed a certain man thus:
“Come, good man, go to the Blessed One, pay homage in my name with
your head at his feet, and say: ‘Venerable sir, the householder
Anathapindika is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill; he pays
homage with his head at the Blessed One’s feet.’ Then go to the
venerable Sariputta, pay homage in my name with your head at his
feet, and say: ‘Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is
afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill; he pays homage with his head
at the venerable Sariputta’s feet.’ Then say: ‘It would be
good, venerable sir, if the venerable Sariputta would come to the
residence of the householder Anathapindika, out of compassion.’“</P>
<P  >“Yes,
sir,” the man replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side and
delivered his message. Then he went to the venerable Sariputta, and
after paying homage to the venerable Sariputta, he delivered his
message, saying: “It would be good, venerable sir, if the venerable
Sariputta would come to the residence of the householder
Anathapindika, out of compassion.” The venerable Sariputta
consented in silence.</P>
<P  >3.
Then the venerable Sariputta dressed, and taking his bowl and outer
robe, went to the residence of the householder Anathapindika with the
venerable Ananda as his attendant. Having gone there, [259] he sat
down on a seat made ready and said to the householder Anathapindika:
“I hope you are getting well, householder, I hope you are
comfortable. I hope your</P>
<P  >painful
feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that their subsiding,
not their increase, is apparent.”</P>
<P  >4.
“Venerable Sariputta, I am not getting well, I am not comfortable.
My painful feelings are increasing, not subsiding; their increase and
not their subsiding is apparent. Just as if a strong man were
splitting my head open with a sharp sword, so too, violent winds cut
through my head. I am not getting well … Just as if a strong man
were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband,
so too, there are violent pains in my head. I am not getting well …
Just as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an
ox’s belly with a sharp butcher’s knife, so too, violent winds
are carving up my belly. I am not getting well … Just as if two
strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over
a pit of hot coals, so too, there is a violent burning in my body. I
am not getting well, I am not comfortable. My painful feelings are
increasing, not subsiding; their increase and not their subsiding is
apparent.”</P>

When this was said, the householder Anathapindika wept and shed
tears. Then the venerable Ananda asked him: “Are you foundering,
householder, are you sinking?”</P>
<P  >“I
am not foundering, venerable Ananda, I am not sinking. But although I
have long waited upon the Teacher and bhikkhus worthy of esteem,
never before have I heard such a talk on the Dhamma.”</P>
<P  >“Such
talk on the Dhamma, householder, is not given to lay people clothed
in white. Such talk on the Dhamma is given to those who have gone
forth.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1306anc" HREF="#sdendnote1306sym"><SUP>mcccvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Well
then, venerable Sariputta, let such talk on the Dhamma be given to
lay people clothed in white. There are clansmen with little dust in
their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing [such talk on]
the Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma.”</P>
<P  >16.
Then, after giving the householder Anathapindika this advice, the
venerable Sariputta and the venerable Ananda rose from their seats
and departed. Soon after they had left, [262] the householder
Anathapindika died and reappeared in the Tusita heaven.</P>
<P  >17.
Then, when the night was well advanced, Anathapindika, now a young
god of beautiful appearance, went to the Blessed One, illuminating
the whole of Jeta’s Grove. After paying homage to the Blessed One,
he stood at one side and addressed the Blessed One in stanzas:</P>
<P >
“Oh blessed is this Jeta’s Grove,</P>
<P >
Dwelt in by the sagely Sangha,</P>
<P >
Wherein resides the King of Dhamma,</P>
<P >
The fount of all my happiness.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
By action, knowledge and Dhamma,</P>
<P >
By virtue and noble way of life –</P>
<P >
By these are mortals purified,</P>
<P >
Not by lineage or wealth.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Therefore a wise person who sees</P>
<P >
What truly leads to his own good,</P>
<P >
Should investigate the Dhamma</P>
<P >
And purify himself with it.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Sariputta has reached the peak</P>
<P >
In virtue, peace, and wisdom’s ways;</P>
<P >
Any bhikkhu who has gone beyond</P>
<P >
At best can only equal him.”</P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >18.
That is what the young god Anathapindika said, and the Teacher
approved. Then the young god Anathapindika, thinking: “The Teacher
has approved of me,” paid homage to the Blessed One, and keeping
him on his right, he vanished at once.</P>
<P  >19.
When the night had ended, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus: “Bhikkhus, last night when the night was well advanced, there
came to me a certain young god of beautiful appearance who
illuminated the whole of Jeta’s Grove. After paying homage to me,
he stood at one side and addressed me in stanzas thus:</P>
<P >
‘Oh blessed is this Jeta’s Grove …</P>
<P >
At best can only equal him.’ [263]</P>

</P>
<P  >That
is what the young god said. Then the young god, thinking: ‘The
Teacher has approved of me,’ paid homage to me, and keeping me on
his right, he vanished at once.”</P>
<P  >20.
When this was said, the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One:
“Surely, venerable sir, that young god must have been
Anathapindika. For the householder Anathapindika had perfect
confidence in the venerable Sariputta.”</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Ananda! You have deduced the right conclusion. That young god
was Anathapindika, no one else.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

144. Channovada Sutta - Advice to Channa</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta, the venerable Maha
Cunda, and the venerable Channa were living on the mountain Vulture
Peak.</P>
<P  >3.
On that occasion the venerable Channa was afflicted, suffering, and
gravely ill. Then, when it was evening, the venerable Sariputta rose
from meditation, went to the venerable Maha Cunda, and said to him:
“Friend Cunda, let us go to the venerable Channa and ask about his
illness.” - “Yes, friend,” the venerable Maha Cunda replied.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the venerable Sariputta and the venerable Maha Cunda went to the
venerable Channa and exchanged greetings with him. When [264] this
courteous and amiable talk was finished, they sat down at one side
and the venerable Sariputta said to the venerable Channa: “I hope
you are getting well, friend Channa, I hope you are comfortable. I
hope your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that
their subsiding, not their increase, is apparent.”</P>
<P  >5.
“Friend Sariputta, I am not getting well, I am not comfortable. My
painful feelings are increasing, not subsiding; … (as Sutta 143,
§4) … their increase and not their subsiding is apparent. I shall.
use the knife,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1307anc" HREF="#sdendnote1307sym"><SUP>mcccvii</SUP></A></SUP>
friend Sariputta; I have no desire to live.”</P>
<P  >6.
“Let the venerable Channa not use the knife. Let the venerable
Channa live. We want the venerable Channa to live. If he lacks
suitable food, I will go in search of suitable food for him. If he
lacks suitable medicine, I will go in search of suitable medicine for
him. If he lacks a proper attendant, I will attend on him. Let the
venerable Channa not use the knife. Let the venerable Channa live. We
want the venerable Channa to live.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Friend Sariputta, it is not that I have no suitable food and
medicine or no proper attendant. But rather, friend Sariputta, the
Teacher has long been worshipped by me with love, not without love;
for it is proper for the disciple to worship the Teacher with love,
not without love. Friend Sariputta, remember this: the bhikkhu Channa
will use the knife blamelessly.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1308anc" HREF="#sdendnote1308sym"><SUP>mcccviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
“We would ask the venerable Channa certain questions, if the
venerable Channa finds it opportune to reply.”</P>
<P  >“Ask,
friend Sariputta. When I have heard, I shall know.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Friend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye-consciousness, and
things cognizable [by the mind] through eye-consciousness thus: ‘This
is mine, this I am, [265] this is my self’? Do you regard the ear …
the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind,
mind-consciousness, and things cognizable [by the mind] through
mind-consciousness thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my
self’?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Sariputta, I regard the eye, eye-consciousness, and things cognizable
[by the mind] through eye-consciousness thus: ‘This is not mine,
this I am not, this is not my self.’ I regard the ear … the nose
… the tongue … the body … the mind, mind-consciousness, and
things cognizable [by the mind] through mind-consciousness thus:
‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’“</P>
<P  >10.
“Friend Channa, what have you seen, what have you directly known in
the eye, in eye-consciousness, and in things cognizable [by the mind]
through eye-consciousness, that you regard them thus: ‘This is not
mine, this I am not, this is not my self’? What have you seen, what
have you directly known in the ear … in the nose … in the tongue
… in the body … in the mind, in mind-consciousness, and in things
cognizable [by the mind] through mind-consciousness, that you regard
them thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self’?”</P>
<P  >“Friend
Sariputta, it is through seeing cessation, through directly knowing
cessation in the eye, in eye-consciousness, and in things cognizable
[by the mind] through eye-consciousness, that I regard them thus:
‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ It is
through seeing cessation, through directly knowing cessation in the
ear … in the nose … in the tongue … in the body … in the
mind, in mind-consciousness, and in things cognizable [by the mind]
through mind-consciousness, [266] that I regard them thus: ‘This is
not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’“</P>
<P  >11.
When this was said, the venerable Maha Cunda said to the venerable
Channa:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1309anc" HREF="#sdendnote1309sym"><SUP>mcccix</SUP></A></SUP>
“Therefore, friend Channa, this instruction of the Blessed One’s
is to be constantly given attention: ‘There is wavering in one who
is dependent, there is no wavering in one who is independent; when
there is no wavering, there is tranquillity; when there is
tranquillity, there is no bias; when there is no bias, there is no
coming and going; when there is no coming and going, there is no
passing away and reappearing; when there is no passing away and
reappearing, there is no here nor beyond nor in between. This is the
end of suffering.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1310anc" HREF="#sdendnote1310sym"><SUP>mcccx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
Then when the venerable Sariputta and the venerable Maha Cunda had
advised the venerable Channa thus, they rose from their seats and
went away. Then, soon after they had gone, the venerable Channa used
the knife.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1311anc" HREF="#sdendnote1311sym"><SUP>mcccxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
Then the venerable Sariputta went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed
One: “Venerable sir, the venerable Channa has used the knife. What
is his destination, what is his future course?”</P>
<P  >“Sariputta,
didn’t the bhikkhu Channa declare to you his blamelessness?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1312anc" HREF="#sdendnote1312sym"><SUP>mcccxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, there is a Vajjian village called Pubbajira. There the venerable
Channa had families that were his friends, families that were his
intimates, families that were blameworthy.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1313anc" HREF="#sdendnote1313sym"><SUP>mcccxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“There
are those families that were friends of the bhikkhu Channa,
Sariputta, families that were his intimates, families that were
blameworthy; but I do not say that to this extent he was blameworthy.
Sariputta, when one lays down this body and clings to a new body,
then I say one is blameworthy. There was none of that in the bhikkhu
Channa; the bhikkhu Channa used the knife blamelessly.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1314anc" HREF="#sdendnote1314sym"><SUP>mcccxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Sariputta was satisfied

145. Punnovada Sutta - Advice to Punna</H2>
<P  >[267]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. Then, when it was
evening, the venerable Purina rose from meditation and went to the
Blessed One.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1315anc" HREF="#sdendnote1315sym"><SUP>mcccxv</SUP></A></SUP>
After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side and
said to him:</P>
<P  >2.
“Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would give me
brief advice. Having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I will
abide alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</P>
<P  >“Well
then, Purina, listen and attend carefully to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” the venerable Purina replied. The Blessed One said
this:</P>
<P  >3.
“Punna, there are forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. If a bhikkhu delights in them, welcomes them,
and remains holding to them, delight arises in him. With the arising
of delight, Punna, there is the arising of suffering, I say.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1316anc" HREF="#sdendnote1316sym"><SUP>mcccxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
There are, Punna, sounds cognizable by the ear … odours cognizable
by the nose … flavours cognizable by the tongue … tangibles
cognizable by the body … mind-objects cognizable by the mind that
are wished for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with
sensual desire [268] and provocative of lust. If a bhikkhu delights
in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, delight arises
in him. With the arising of delight, Punna, there is the arising of
suffering, I say.</P>
<P  >4.
“Punna, there are forms cognizable by the eye … sounds cognizable
by the ear … odours cognizable by the nose … flavours cognizable
by the tongue … tangibles cognizable by the body … mind-objects
cognizable by the mind that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and
likeable, connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust. If a
bhikkhu does not delight in them, welcome them, and remain holding to
them, delight ceases in him. With the cessation of delight, Punna,
there is the cessation of suffering, I say.</P>
<P  >5.
“Now that I have given you this brief advice, Punna, in which
country will you dwell?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, now that the Blessed One has given me this brief advice, I am
going to dwell in the Sunaparanta country.”</P>
<P  >“Punna,
the people of Sunaparanta are fierce and rough. If they abuse and
threaten you, what will you think then?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta abuse and threaten me, then I shall
think: ‘These people of Sunaparanta are kind, truly kind, in that
they did not give me a blow with the fist.’ Then I shall think
thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime One.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with the fist,
what will you think then?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with the fist,
then I shall think: ‘These people of Sunaparanta are kind, truly
kind, in that they did not give me a blow with a clod.’ Then I
shall think thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime One.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a clod,
what will you think then?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with a clod, then
I shall think: ‘These people of Sunaparanta are kind, truly kind,
in that they did not give me a blow with a stick.’ Then I shall
think thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime One.”
[269]</P>
<P  >“But,
Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a stick,
what will you think then?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with a stick,
then I shall think: ‘These people of Sunaparanta are kind, truly
kind, in that they did not give me a blow with a knife.’ Then I
shall think thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime One.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a knife,
what will you think then?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with a knife,
then I shall think: ‘These people of Sunaparanta are kind, truly
kind, in that they have not taken my life with a sharp knife.’ Then
I shall think thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime
One.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta do take your life with a sharp
knife, what will you think then?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta do take my life with a sharp knife,
then I shall think thus: ‘There have been disciples of the Blessed
One who, being humiliated and disgusted by the body and by life,
sought to have their lives deprived by the knife. But I have had my
life deprived by the knife without seeking for it.’ Then I shall
think thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime One.”</P>
<P  >6.
“Good, good, Punna! Possessing such self-control and peacefulness,
you will be able to dwell in the Sunaparanta country. Now, Punna, it
is time to do as you think fit.”</P>
<P  >7.
Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s words, the
venerable Punna rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the
Blessed One, departed keeping him on his right. He then set his
resting place in order, took his bowl and outer robe, and set out to
wander towards the Sunaparanta country. Wandering by stages, he
eventually arrived in the Sunaparanta country, and there he lived.
Then, during that Rains, the venerable Punna established five hundred
men lay followers and five hundred women lay followers in the
practice, and he himself realised the three true knowledges. On a
later occasion, the venerable Punna attained final Nibbana.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1317anc" HREF="#sdendnote1317sym"><SUP>mcccxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
Then a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him: “Venerable
sir, the clansman Punna, who [270] was given brief advice by the
Blessed One, has died. What is his destination? What is his future
course?”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhus,
the clansman Punna was wise. He practised in accordance with the
Dhamma and did not trouble me in the interpretation of the Dhamma.
The clansman Punna has attained final Nibbana.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

146. Nandakovada Sutta - Advice from Nandaka</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was liv</P>
<P  >ing
at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Mahapajapati Gotam% together with five hundred bhikkhunis went
to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, she stood
at one side and said to him: “Venerable sir, let the Blessed One
advise the bhikkhunis, let the Blessed One instruct the bhikkhunis,
let the Blessed One give the bhikkhunis a talk on the Dhamma.”</P>
<P  >3.
Now on that occasion the elder bhikkhus were taking turns in advising
the bhikkhunis, but the venerable Nandaka did not want to advise them
when his turn came.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1318anc" HREF="#sdendnote1318sym"><SUP>mcccxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda: “Ananda, whose
turn is it today to advise the bhikkhunis?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, it is the venerable Nandaka’s turn to advise the bhikkhunis,
but he does not want to advise them even though it is his turn.”</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Nandaka: “Advise the
bhikkhunis, Nandaka. Instruct the bhikkhunis, Nandaka. Give the
bhikkhunis a talk on the Dhamma, brahmin.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” [271] the venerable Nandaka replied. Then, in the
morning, the venerable Nandaka dressed, and taking his bowl and outer
robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When he had wandered for alms in
Savatthi and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went
with a companion to the Rajaka Park. The bhikkhunis saw the venerable
Nandaka coming in the distance and prepared a seat and set out water
for the feet. The venerable Nandaka sat down on the seat made ready
and washed his feet. The bhikkhunis paid homage to him and sat down
at one side. When they were seated, the venerable Nandaka told the
bhikkhunis:</P>
<P  >5.
“Sisters, this talk will be in the form of questions. When you
understand you should say: ‘We understand’; when you do not
understand you should say: ‘We do not understand’; when you are
doubtful or perplexed you should ask me: ‘How is this, venerable
sir? What is the meaning of this?’“</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, we are satisfied and pleased with the master Nandaka for
inviting us in this way.”</P>
<P  >6.
“Sisters, what do you think? Is the eye permanent or impermanent?”
- “Impermanent, venerable sir.” - “Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?” - “Suffering, venerable sir.” - “Is

“No, venerable sir.”</P>

impermanent, suffering, [272] and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?” -
“No, venerable sir. Why is that? Because, venerable sir, we have

<P  >“Good,

<P  >“No,

“Sisters, suppose a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to kill
a cow and carve it up with a sharp butcher’s knife. Without
damaging the inner mass of flesh and without damaging the outer hide,
he would cut, sever, and carve away the inner tendons, sinews, and
ligaments with the sharp butcher’s knife. [275] Then having cut,
severed, and carved all this away, he would remove the outer hide and
cover the cow again with that same hide. Would he be speaking rightly
if he were to say: ‘This cow is joined to this hide just as it was
before’?”</P>

that cow would still be disjoined from that hide.”</P>

“Sisters, I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning.
This is the meaning: ‘The inner mass of flesh’ is a term for the

When the venerable Nandaka had advised the bhikkhunis thus, he
dismissed them, saying: “Go, sisters, it is time.” Then the
bhikkhunis, having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Nandaka’s
words, rose from their seats, and after paying homage to the
venerable Nandaka, departed keeping him on their right. They went to
the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, stood at one side.
The Blessed One told them: “Go, sisters, it is time.” Then the
bhikkhunis paid homage to the Blessed One and departed keeping him on

Soon after they had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:
“Bhikkhus, just as on the Uposatha day of the fourteenth people are
not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is incomplete or

bhikkhunis are satisfied with Nandaka’s teaching of the Dhamma, but
their intention has not yet been fulfilled.”</P>

147. Cularahulovada Sutta - The Shorter Discourse of Advice to Rahula</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1323anc" HREF="#sdendnote1323sym"><SUP>mcccxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Then, while the Blessed One was alone in meditation, a thought arose
in his mind thus: “The states that ripen in deliverance have
ripened in Rahula.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1324anc" HREF="#sdendnote1324sym"><SUP>mcccxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Suppose I were to lead him on further to the destruction of the
taints.”</P>
<P  >Then,
when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and
outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When he had walked for alms
in Savatthi and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he
addressed the venerable Rahula thus:</P>
<P  >“Take
your sitting cloth with you, Rahula; let us go to the Blind Men’s
Grove [278] to pass the day.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” the venerable Rahula replied, and taking his
sitting cloth with him, he followed close behind the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >Now
on that occasion many thousands of deities followed the Blessed One,
thinking: “Today the Blessed One will lead the venerable Rahula
further to the destruction of the taints.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1325anc" HREF="#sdendnote1325sym"><SUP>mcccxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the Blessed One went into the Blind Men’s Grove and sat down
at the root of a certain tree on a seat made ready. And the venerable
Rahula paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side. The
Blessed One then said to the venerable Rahula:</P>
<P  >3.
“Rahula, what do you think? Is the eye permanent or impermanent?”
- “Impermanent, venerable sir.” - “Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?” - “Suffering, venerable sir.” - “Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?” -
“No, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“Rahula,
what do you think? Are forms … Is eye-consciousness … [279] …
Is eye-contact … Are any feeling, any perception, any formations,
any consciousness that arise with eye-contact as condition permanent
or impermanent?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1326anc" HREF="#sdendnote1326sym"><SUP>mcccxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
- “Impermanent, venerable sir.” - “Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?” - “Suffering, venerable sir.” - “Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?” -
“No, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >4-8.
“Rahula, what do you think? Is the ear permanent or impermanent? …
Is the nose permanent or impermanent? … Is the tongue permanent or
impermanent? … Is the body permanent or impermanent?.. .Are
mind-objects … Is mind-consciousness … Is mind-contact … Are
any feeling, any perception, any formations, any consciousness that
arise with mind-contact as condition permanent or impermanent?” -
“Impermanent, venerable sir.” - “Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?” - “Suffering, venerable sir.” - “Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?” -
“No, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Seeing thus, Rahula, a well-taught noble disciple becomes
disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with
eye-consciousness, disenchanted with eye-contact, and disenchanted
with any feeling, any perception, any formations, any consciousness
that arise with eye-contact as condition.</P>
<P  >“He
becomes disenchanted with the ear … He becomes disenchanted with
the nose … He becomes disenchanted with the tongue … He becomes
disenchanted with the body … He becomes disenchanted with the mind,
disenchanted with mind-objects, disenchanted. with
mind-consciousness, disenchanted with mindcontact, [280] and
disenchanted with any feeling, any perception, any formations, any
consciousness that arise with mind-contact as condition.</P>
<P  >10.
“Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion
[his mind] is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the
knowledge: ‘It is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is
destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been
done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’“</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Rahula was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words. Now while this discourse was
being spoken, through not clinging the venerable Rahula’s mind was
liberated from the taints. And in those many thousands of deities
there arose the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma: “All that
is subject to arising is subject to cessation.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1327anc" HREF="#sdendnote1327sym"><SUP>mcccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

(i) “Bhikkhus, dependent on the eye and forms, eyeconsciousness
arises; the meeting of the three is contact; with contact as
condition there arises [a feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant. When one is touched by a pleasant
feeling, if one does not delight in it, welcome it, and remain
holding to it, then the underlying tendency to lust does not lie
within one. When one is touched by a painful feeling, if one does not
sorrow, grieve and lament, does not weep beating one’s breast and
become distraught, then the underlying tendency to aversion does not
lie within one. When one is touched by a neither-painful-nor-pleasant
feeling, if one understands as it actually is the origination, the
disappearance, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in
regard to that feeling, then the underlying tendency to ignorance
does not lie within one. Bhikkhus, that one shall here and now make
an end of suffering by abandoning the underlying tendency to lust for
pleasant feeling, by abolishing the underlying tendency to aversion
towards painful feeling, by extirpating the underlying tendency to
ignorance in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, by
abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge - this is possible.</P>

tendency to lust for pleasant feeling … by abandoning ignorance and
arousing true knowledge - this is possible.</P>
<H3 >(LIBERATION)</H3>
<P  >40.
“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes
disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with
eye-consciousness, disenchanted with eye-contact, disenchanted with
feeling, disenchanted with craving.</P>
<P  >“He
becomes disenchanted with the ear … He becomes disenchanted with
the nose … He becomes disenchanted with the tongue … He becomes
disenchanted with the body … He becomes disenchanted with the mind,
disenchanted with mindobjects, disenchanted with mind-consciousness,
disenchanted with mind-contact, disenchanted with feeling,
disenchanted with craving.</P>
<P  >41.
“Being disenchanted, [287] he becomes dispassionate. Through
dispassion [his mind] is liberated. When it is liberated, there comes
the knowledge: ‘It is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is
destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been
done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’“</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words. Now while this discourse was

liberated from the taints.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1337anc" HREF="#sdendnote1337sym"><SUP>mcccxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

149. Mahasalayatanika Sutta - The Great Sixfold Base</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on the great sixfold base.
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes, venerable
sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
“Bhikkhus, when one does not know and see the eye as it actually
is,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1338anc" HREF="#sdendnote1338sym"><SUP>mcccxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
when one does not know and see forms as they actually are, when one

does not know and see eye-contact as it actually is, when one does
not know and see as it actually is [the feeling] felt as pleasant or
painful or neither-painful-norpleasant that arises with eye-contact
as condition, then one is inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms,
for eye-consciousness, for eye-contact, for [the feeling] felt as
pleasant or painful or neitherpainful-nor-pleasant that arises with
eye-contact as condition.</P>
<P  >“When
one abides inflamed by lust, fettered, infatuated, contemplating
gratification, then the five aggregates affected by clinging are
built up for oneself in the future;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1339anc" HREF="#sdendnote1339sym"><SUP>mcccxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
and one’s craving - which brings renewal of being, is accompanied
by delight and lust, and delights in this and that - increases. One’s
bodily and [288] mental troubles increase, one’s bodily and mental
torments increase, one’s bodily and mental fevers increase, and one
experiences bodily and mental suffering.</P>
<P  >4-8.
“When one does not know and see the ear as it actually is … When

“Bhikkhus, when one knows and sees the eye as it actually is,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1340anc" HREF="#sdendnote1340sym"><SUP>mcccxl</SUP></A></SUP>
when one knows and sees forms as they actually are, when one knows

pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant that arises with
eye-contact as condition.</P>
<P  >“When
one abides uninflamed by lust, unfettered, uninfatuated,
contemplating danger, then the five aggregates affected by clinging
are diminished for oneself in the future; and one’s craving - which
brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and
delights in this or that - is abandoned. One’s bodily and mental
troubles are abandoned, one’s bodily and mental torments are
abandoned, one’s bodily and mental fevers are abandoned, [289] and
one experiences bodily and mental pleasure.</P>
<P  >10.
“The view of a person such as this is right view. His intention is
right intention, his effort is right effort, his mindfulness is right

150. Nagaravindeyya Sutta - To the Nagaravindans</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually
arrived at a Kosalan village named Nagaravinda.</P>
<P  >2.
The brahmin householders of Nagaravinda heard: “The recluse Gotama,
the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been
wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus
[291] and has come to Nagaravinda. Now a good report of Master Gotama
has been spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is accomplished,
fully enlightened … (as Sutta 4.1, §2) … he reveals a holy life
that is utterly perfect and pure.’ Now it is good to see such
arahants.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then the brahmin householders of Nagaravinda went to the Blessed One.
Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, sat down at one side; some extended their hands in
reverential salutation towards the Blessed One and sat down at one
side; some pronounced their name and clan in the Blessed One’s
presence and sat down at one side; some kept silent and sat down at
one side. When they were seated, the Blessed One said to them:</P>
<P  >4.
“Householders, if wanderers of other sects ask you thus:
‘Householders, what kind of recluses and brahmins should not be
honoured, respected, revered, and venerated?’ you should answer
them thus: ‘Those recluses and brahmins who are not rid of lust,
hate, and delusion regarding forms cognizable by the eye, whose minds
are not inwardly peaceful, and who conduct themselves now
righteously, now unrighteously in body, speech, and mind - such
recluses and brahmins should not be honoured, respected, revered, and
venerated. Why is that?</P>
<P  >Because
we ourselves are not rid of lust, hate, and delusion regarding forms
cognizable by the eye, our minds are not inwardly peaceful, and we
conduct ourselves now righteously, now unrighteously in body, speech,

honoured, respected, revered, and venerated.</P>
<P  >“‘Those

this way.</P>

“But, householders, if wanderers of other sects ask you thus:
‘Householders, what kind of recluses and brahmins should be

householders, you should answer those wanderers of other sects in
this way.</P>
<P  >6.
“Householders, if wanderers of other sects ask you thus: ‘But
what are your reasons and what is your evidence regarding those
venerable ones whereby you say about them: “Surely these venerable
ones [293] are either rid of lust or are practising for the removal
of lust; they are either rid of hate or are practising for the
removal of hate; they are either rid of delusion or are practising
for the removal of delusion”?’ - being asked thus, you should
answer those wanderers of other sects thus: ‘It is because those
venerable ones resort to remote jungle-thicket resting places in the
forest. For there are no forms cognizable by the eye there of a kind
that they could look at and delight in. There are no sounds
cognizable by the ear there of a kind that they could listen to and
delight in. There are no odours cognizable by the nose there of a
kind that they could smell and delight in. There are no flavours
cognizable by the tongue there of a kind that they could taste and
delight in. There are no tangibles cognizable by the body there of a
kind that they could touch and delight in. These are our reasons,
friends, this is our evidence whereby we say about those venerable
ones: “Surely these venerable ones are either rid of lust, hate,
and delusion, or are practising for their removal.’“Being thus
asked, householders, you should answer those wanderers of other sects
in this way.”</P>
<P  >7.
When this was said, the brahmin householders of Nagaravinda said to
the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master
Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as
though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a
lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms. We go to
Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of
bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama accept us as lay followers who
have gone to him for refuge for life.”</P>

Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Then, when
it was evening, the venerable Sariputta rose from meditation and went

side. The Blessed One then said to him: [294]</P>
<P  >2.
“Sariputta, your faculties are clear. The colour of your skin is

“So, Sariputta, if a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I now often abide

152. Indriyabhavana Sutta - The Development of the Faculties</H2>
<P  >[298]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Kajangala in a grove of mukhelu trees.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the brahmin student Uttara, a pupil of the brahmin Parasariya,
went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this

teach his disciples the development of the faculties?”</P>
<P  >“He
does, Master Gotama.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Uttara, how does he teach his disciples the development of the
faculties?”</P>
<P  >“Here,.
Master Gotama, one does not see forms with the eye, one does not hear
sounds with the ear. That is how the brahmin Parasariya teaches his
disciples the development of the faculties.”</P>
<P  >“If
that is so, Uttara, then a blind man and a deaf man will have
developed faculties, according to what the brahmin Parasariya says.
For a blind man does not see forms with the eye, and a deaf man does
not hear sounds with the ear.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin student Uttara, Parasariya’s pupil, sat
silent, dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and
without response.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, knowing this, the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda:
“Ananda, the brahmin Parasariya teaches his disciples the
development of the faculties in one way, but in the Noble One’s
Discipline the supreme development of the faculties is otherwise.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1352anc" HREF="#sdendnote1352sym"><SUP>mccclii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Now

One, the bhikkhus will remember it.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, Ananda, and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” he replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>

“Now, Ananda, how is there the supreme development of the faculties
in the Noble One’s Discipline? Here, Ananda, when a bhikkhu sees a

arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and
disagreeable.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1353anc" HREF="#sdendnote1353sym"><SUP>mcccliii</SUP></A></SUP>
He understands thus: ‘There has arisen in me what is agreeable,
there has arisen what is disagreeable, there has arisen what is both

dependently arisen; this is peaceful, this is sublime, that is,
equanimity.’ The agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose,
and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease in him and
equanimity is established.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1354anc" HREF="#sdendnote1354sym"><SUP>mcccliv</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as a man with good sight, having opened his eyes might shut them

just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This

“Again, Ananda, when a bhikkhu hears a sound with the ear, there

“Again, Ananda, when a bhikkhu smells an odour with the nose, there

slightly sloping lotus leaf roll off and do not remain there, so too

“Again, Ananda, when a bhikkhu tastes a flavour with the tongue,

One’s Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding

“And how, Ananda, is one a disciple in higher training, one who has
entered upon the way? Here, Ananda, when a bhikkhu sees a form with
the eye … [301] hears a sound with the ear … smells an odour with
the nose … tastes a flavour with the tongue … touches a tangible
with the body … cognizes a mindobject with the mind, there arises
in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there
arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable; he is ashamed,
humiliated and disgusted by the agreeable that arose, by the
disagreeable that arose, and by the both agreeable and disagreeable
that arose.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1357anc" HREF="#sdendnote1357sym"><SUP>mccclvii</SUP></A></SUP>

If he should wish: ‘May I abide perceiving the unrepulsive in the

If he should wish: ‘May I abide perceiving the repulsive in the

perceiving the unrepulsive in that. If he should wish: ‘May I abide
perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ he
abides perceiving the repulsive in that. If he should wish: ‘May I,
avoiding both the repulsive and unrepulsive, [302] abide in

“So, Ananda, the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble
One’s Discipline has been taught by me, the disciple in higher
training who has entered upon the way has been taught by me, and the
noble one with developed faculties has been taught by me.</P>
<P  >18.
“What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a
Teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I
have done for you, Ananda. There are these roots of trees, these
empty huts. Meditate, Ananda, do not delay, or else you will regret
it later. This is our instruction to you.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>

<H2 NAME="Heading157"  >
Index of Subjects</H2>
<P  >THIS
INDEX LISTS SIGNIFICANT REFERENCES only. Italicised numbers refer to
the page numbers of the Introduction; references to sutta passages
give sutta number followed by section number. The abbreviation “ff.”
is here used to indicate that the term of entry pertains to a
continuing or repetitive sequence of sections and does not
necessarily mean that the term occurs in every section of the
sequence. References may be listed under an entry even when the term
itself does not appear in the text, as long as the passage is
pertinent to the term of entry.</P>
<P  >When
a stock formulation is applied to each term in a set of categories,
the reference is usually given only under the name of the set, not
under the individual items belonging to that set. For example, the
passage on the enlightenment factors at 2.21 is reg&shy;istered under
Enlightenment factors, but not under the names of the individual
factors. Cross-references ensure that essential ref&shy;erences are
not overlooked.</P>
<P  >Pali
equivalents are provided for all key doctrinal terms, though not for
terms of lesser importance or for entries without an exact Pali
counterpart. With few exceptions, the Pali term is given in the
singular, even though the English entry may be plural. When two Pali
words with a different denotation are ren&shy;dered by a single
English word, the two are listed as separate entries - e.g., Mind is
listed twice, corresponding to citta and to mano. When a single
English word represents two Pali words with overlapping meanings but
different contextual usage, the two sets of references are classified
within the same entry sepa&shy;rated by a slash - e.g., Compassion as
a rendering for both karuna and anukampa.</P>

Mulapariyaya Sutta – The Root of All Things</H5>
<P  ><SUP></SUP>
For a fuller treatment of this important and difficult sutta, see
Bhikkhu Bodhi, Discourse on the Root of Existence. This work
contains, besides a translation of the sutta, a lengthy analytical
study of its philosophical significance and copious extracts from
the very helpful commentarial literature that has accumulated around
it. Nm’s rendering of this sutta in Ms was highly conjectural;
thus, while I have retained most of his terminology, I have
substituted my own rendering of the syntax to bring out the meaning
that accords with the traditional interpretation and that seems
warranted by the original Pali text as well. The key passages as Nm
rendered them will be given in the Notes.</P>

MA explains that the Buddha delivered this sutta to dispel the
conceit that had arisen in five hundred bhikkhus on account of their
erudition and intellectual mastery of the Buddha’s teachings.
These bhikkhus were formerly brahmins learned in the Vedic
literature, and the Buddha’s cryptic utterances may well have been
intended to challenge the brahmanic views to which they may still
have adhered.</P>

Sabbadhammamulapariyaya. MT explains that the word “all” (sabba)
is being used here in the restricted sense of the “all of
personality” (sakkayasabba), that is, with reference to all states
or phenomena (dhamma) comprised within the five aggregates affected
by clinging (see MN 28.4). Supramundane states - the paths, fruits,
and Nibbana - are excluded. The “root of all things” - that is,
the special condition that maintains the continuity of the process
of repeated existence - MT explains to be craving, conceit, and
views (which are the underlying springs of “conceiving”), and.
these in turn are underlaid by ignorance, suggested in the sutta by
the phrase “he has not fully understood it.”</P>

The “untaught ordinary person” (assutava puthujjana) is the
common worldling, who possesses neither learning nor spiritual
accomplishment in the Dhamma of the noble ones, and allows himself
to be dominated by the multitude of defilements and wrong views. See
Bodhi, Discourse on the Root of Existence, pp. 40-46.</P>

Pathavitn pathavito sanjanati. Although perceiving “earth as
earth” seems to suggest seeing the object as it really is, the aim
of Buddhist insight meditation, the context makes it clear that the
ordinary person’s perception of “earth as earth” already
introduces a slight distortion of the object, a distortion that will
be blown up into fullfledged misinterpretation when the cognitive
process enters the phase of “conceiving.” MA explains that the
ordinary person seizes upon the conventional expression “it is
earth,” and applying this to the object, perceives it through a
“perversion of perception” (sannavipallasa). The latter is a
technical expression explained as perceiving the impermanent as
permanent, the painful as pleasurable, what is not self as self, and
what is foul as beautiful (AN 4:49/ii.52). 1SIm reads the ablative
suffix -to of the Pali as signifying derivation and translates the
phrase: “From earth he has a percept of earth.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote6">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote6sym" HREF="#sdendnote6anc">vi</A>
The Pali verb “conceives” (mannati), from the root man, “to
think,” is often used in the Pali suttas to mean distortional
thinking - thought that ascribes to its object characteristics and a
significance derived not from the object itself, but from its own
subjective imaginings. The cognitive distortion introduced by
conceiving consists, in brief, in the intrusion of the egocentric
perspective into the experience already slightly distorted by
spontaneous perception. According to the commentaries, the activity
of conceiving is governed by three defilements, which accounts for
the different ways it comes to manifestation - craving (tanha),
conceit (mana), and views (ditthi).</P>
<P  >MA
paraphrases this text thus: “Having perceived earth with a
perverted perception, the ordinary person afterwards conceives it -
construes or discriminates it - through the gross proliferating
tendencies (papanca) of craving, conceit, and views, which are here
called ‘conceivings.’ … He apprehends it in diverse ways
contrary [to reality].”</P>
<P  >The
four ways of conceiving (mannana): The Buddha shows that the
conceiving of any object may occur in any of four ways, expressed by
the text as a fourfold linguistic pattern: accusative, locative,
ablative, and appropriative. The primary significance of this modal
pattern - enigmatic in the Pali as well - seems to be ontological. I
take the pattern to represent the diverse ways in which the ordinary
person attempts to give positive being to his imagined sense of
egohood by positing, below the threshold of reflection, a
relationship between himself as the subject of cognition and the
perceived phenomenon as its object. According to the fourfold
pattern given, this relationship may be one either of direct
identification (“he conceives X”), or of inherence (“he
conceives in X”), or of contrast or derivation (“he conceives
from X”), or of simple appropriation (“he conceives X to be
‘mine”‘).</P>
<P  >But
care is needed in interpreting these phrases. The Pali does not
supply any direct object for the second and third modes, and this
suggests that the process at work in conceiving proceeds from a
deeper and more general level than that involved in the forming of
an explicit view of self, as described for example at MN 2.8 or MN
44.7. The activity of conceiving thus seems to comprise the entire
range of subjectively tinged cognition, from the impulses and
thoughts in which the sense of personal identity is still inchoate
to elaborate intellectual structures in which it has been fully
explicated.</P>
<P  >Nm,
however, understands the implicit object of conceiving to be the
percept itself, and accordingly translates: “having had from earth
a percept of earth, he conceives [that to be] earth, he conceives
[that to be] in earth, he conceives [that to be apart] from earth,”
etc.</P>
<P  >The
fifth phrase, “he delights in X,” explicitly connects conceiving
with craving, which is elsewhere said to “delight here and there.”
This, moreover, hints at the danger in the worldling’s thought
processes, since craving is pointed to by the Buddha as the origin
of suffering.</P>
<P  >MA
gives prolific examples illustrating all the different modes of
conceiving, and these clearly establish that the intended object of
conceiving is the misplaced sense of egoity.</P>

MA states that one who fully understands earth does so by the three
types of full understanding: the full understanding of the known
(nataparinna) - the definition of the earth element by way of its
unique characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause;
the full understanding by scrutinization (tiranaparinna) - the
contemplation of the earth element by way of the three general
characteristics of impermanence, suffering, and non-self; and the
full understanding of abandonment (pahanaparinna) - the abandoning
of desire and lust for the earth element through the supreme path
(of arahantship).</P>

Bhuta. MA says that “beings” here signifies only living beings
below the heaven of the Four Great Kings, the lowest of the
sense-sphere heavens; the higher grades of living beings are covered
by the terms to follow. MA exemplifies the application of the three
types of conceiving to this situation as follows: When a person
becomes attached to beings as a result of sight, hearing, etc., or
desires rebirth in a certain class of beings, this is conceiving due
to craving. When he ranks himself as superior, equal, or inferior to
others, this is conceiving due to conceit. And when he thinks,
“Beings are permanent, stable, eternal,” etc., this is
conceiving due to views.</P>

Abhibhu. MA says this term is a designation for the nonpercipient
realm, called thus because it vanquishes (abhibhavati) the four
immaterial aggregates. The identification sounds contrived,
especially because the word “abhibhu” is a masculine singular
noun. Elsewhere (MN 49.5) the word appears as part of Baka the
Brahma’s claim to theocratic hegemony, yet MA rejects identifying
the Abhibhu with Brahma here as a redundancy.</P>

This and the next three sections deal with conceiving in relation to

In these four sections the phenomena comprising personality are
considered as objects of perception classified into the four
categories of the seen, heard, sensed, and cognized. Here, sensed
(muta) signifies the data of smell, taste, and touch, cognized
(vinnata) the data of introspection, abstract thought, and
imagination. The objects of perception are “conceived” when they
are cognized in terms of “mine,” “I,” and “self,” or in
ways that generate craving, conceit, and views.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote18">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote18sym" HREF="#sdendnote18anc">xviii</A>
In this section and the next, the phenomena comprising personality
are treated as twofold - by way of unity and diversity. The emphasis
on unity (ekatta), MA informs us, is characteristic of one who
attains the jhanas, in which the mind occurs in a single mode on a
single object. The emphasis on diversity (nanatta) prevails in the
case of the non-attainer who lacks the overwhelming unitive
experience of jhanas. Conceivings stressing diversity come to
expression in philosophies of pluralism, those stressing unity in
philosophies of the monistic type.</P>

In this section, all phenomena of personality are collected together
and shown as singlefold. This idea of totality can form the basis
for philosophies of the pantheistic or monistic type, depending on
the relation posited between the self and the all.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote20">

MA understands “Nibbana” here to refer to the five kinds of
“supreme Nibbana here and now” included among the sixty-two
wrong views of the Brahmajala Sutta (DN 1.3.19-25/i.36-38), that is,
Nibbana identified with the full enjoyment of sense pleasures or
with the four jhanas. Enjoying this state, or yearning for it, he
conceives it with craving. Priding himself on attaining it, he
conceives it with conceit. Holding this imaginary Nibbana to be
permanent, etc., he conceives it with views.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote21">

The sekha, the disciple in higher training, is one who has reached
any of the three lower planes of sanctity - stream-entry,
once-returning, or non-returning - but must still train further in
order to reach the goal, arahantship, the supreme security from
bondage. MN 53 is devoted to expounding the training he must
undertake. The arahant is sometimes described as asekha, one beyond
training, in the sense that he has completed the training in the
Noble Eightfold Path. Nm rendered sekha as “initiate” and asekha
as “adept,” which have been changed here to avoid their
“esoteric” connotations.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote22">
<P  ><A  NAME="sdendnote22sym" HREF="#sdendnote22anc">xxii</A>
It should be noted that, whereas the ordinary man is said to
perceive each of the bases, the one in higher training is said to
directly know them (abhijandti). MA explains that he knows them with
distinguished knowledge, knows them in accordance with their real
nature as impermanent, suffering, and non-self. Nm rendered:</P>
<P >“From earth he has direct knowledge
of earth.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote23">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote23sym" HREF="#sdendnote23anc">xxiii</A>
The disciple in higher training is urged by the Buddha to refrain
from conceiving and delight because the dispositions to these mental
processes still remain within him. With his attainment of
stream-entry he eradicated the fetter of personality view and thus
can no longer conceive in terms of wrong views. But the defilements
of craving and conceit are only uprooted by the path of arahantship,
and thus the sekha remains vulnerable to the conceivings to which
they are capable of giving rise. Whereas direct knowledge (abhinna)
is the province of both the sekha and the arahant, full
understanding (parinna) is the province exclusively of the arahant,
as it involves the full abandoning of all defilements.</P>

When ignorance has been abolished by the attainment of full
understanding, the subtlest dispositions to craving and conceit are

and delight.</P>

This section and the following two are stated to show that the
arahant does not conceive, not only because he has fully understood
the object, but because he has eradicated the three unwholesome
roots - lust (or greed), hate, and delusion. The phrase “free from
lust through the destruction of lust” is used to stress that the
arahant is not merely temporarily without lust, but has destroyed it
at the most fundamental level. Similarly with hate and delusion.</P>

On this word, the epithet the Buddha uses most often when referring
to himself, see the Introduction, p. 24. The commentaries give a
long detailed etymology, into which they try to compress virtually
the entire Dhamma. The passage has been translated in Bhikkhu Bodhi,
Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views, pp. 331-44.</P>

Parinnatantam tathagatassa. So BBS and SBJ eds. and MA, though PTS
ed. reads simply parinnatam. MA glosses: “fully understood to the
conclusion, fully understood to the limit, fully understood without
remainder.” It explains that while Buddhas and disciple-arahants
are alike in abandoning all defilements, there is a distinction in
their range of full understanding: whereas disciples can attain
Nibbana after comprehending with insight only a limited number of
formations, Buddhas fully understand all formations without
exception.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote29">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote29sym" HREF="#sdendnote29anc">xxix</A>
This sentence gives a highly compressed statement of the formula of
dependent origination (paticca samuppada), usually expounded in
twelve factors (as in MN 38). As interpreted by MA, “delight” is
the craving of the previous life that brought into being the
“suffering” of the five aggregates in the present life, “being”
the kammically determinative aspect of the present life that causes
future birth, followed by future ageing and death. This passage
shows the cause for the Buddha’s elimination of conceiving to be
his penetration of dependent origination on the night of his
enlightenment. The mention of “delight” (nandi) as the root of
suffering links up with the sutta’s title; moreover, by referring
to the earlier statement that the ordinary person delights in earth,
etc., it shows suffering to be the ultimate consequence of delight.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote30">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote30sym" HREF="#sdendnote30anc">xxx</A>
MA explains the sequence of ideas thus: The Tathagata does not
conceive earth and does not delight in earth because he has
understood that delight is the root of,suffering. Further, by
understanding dependent origination, he has completely abandoned the
craving here called “delight” and has awakened to supreme full
enlightenment. As a result he does not conceive earth or delight in
earth.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote31">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote31sym" HREF="#sdendnote31anc">xxxi</A>
The bhikkhus did not delight in the Buddha’s words, apparently
because the discourse probed too deeply into the tender regions of
their own conceit, and perhaps their residual brahmanic views. At a
later time, MA tells us, when their pride had been humbled, the
Buddha expounded to these same bhikkhus the Gotamaka Sutta (AN
3:123/i.276), in the course of which they all attained arahantship.</P>

Sabbasava Sutta – All the Taints</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The taints (asava), a
category of defilements existing at the deepest and most fundamental
level, are discussed in the Introduction, p. 38. MA explains that
restraint (samvara) is fivefold: through virtue, mindfulness,
knowledge, energy, and patience. In the present sutta, restraint
through virtue is illustrated by avoiding unsuitable seats and
resorts (§19); restraint through mindfulness, by restraining the
sense faculties (§12); restraint through knowledge, by the repeated
phrase “reflecting wisely”; restraint through energy, by the
removing of unwholesome thoughts (§20); and restraint through
patience, by the passage on enduring (§18).</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote33">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote33sym" HREF="#sdendnote33anc">xxxiii</A>
Wise attention (yoniso manasikara) is glossed as attention that is
the right means (upaya), on the right track (patha). It is explained
as mental advertence, consideration, or preoccupation that accords
with the truth, namely, attention to the impermanent as impermanent,
etc. Unwise attention (ayoniso manasikara) is attention that is the
wrong means, on the wrong track (uppatha), contrary to the truth,
namely, attention to the impermanent as permanent, the painful as
pleasurable, what is not self as self, and what is foul as
beautiful. Unwise attention, MA informs us, is at the root of the
round of existence, for it causes ignorance and craving to increase;
wise attention is at the root of liberation from the round, since it
leads to the development of the Noble Eightfold Path. MA sums up the
point of this passage thus: the destruction of the taints is for one
who knows how to arouse wise attention and who sees to it that
unwise attention does not arise.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote34">

The word “seeing” (dassana) here refers to the first of the four
supramundane paths - the path of stream-entry (sotapattimagga) - so
designated because it offers the first glimpse of Nibbana. The
higher three paths are called the paths of development (bhavana)
because they develop the vision of Nibbana to the point at which all
defilements are eradicated.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote36">
<P  ><A  NAME="sdendnote36sym" HREF="#sdendnote36anc">xxxvi</A>
MA makes the important point that there is no fixed determination in
things themselves as to whether they are fit or unfit for attention.
The distinction consists, rather, in the mode of attention. That
mode of attention that is a causal basis for unwholesome states of
mind should be avoided, while that mode of attention that is a
causal basis for wholesome states should be developed. This same
principle applies to §9.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote37">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote37sym" HREF="#sdendnote37anc">xxxvii</A>
MA illustrates the growth of the taints through unwise attention as
follows: When he attends to gratification in the five cords of
sensual pleasure, the taint of sensual desire arises and increases;
when he attends to gratification in the exalted states (the jhanas),
the taint of being arises and increases; and when he attends to any
mundane things through the four “perversions” (of permanence,
etc. - see n.5), the taint of ignorance arises and increases.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote38">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote38sym" HREF="#sdendnote38anc">xxxviii</A>
According to MA, this passage is undertaken to show the taint of
views (ditthasava, not expressly mentioned in the discourse) under
the heading of doubt. However, it might be more correct to say that
the taint of views, disclosed by §8, emerges out of unwise
attention in the form of doubt. The various types of doubt are
already pregnant with the wrong views that will come to explicit
expression in the next section.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote39">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote39sym" HREF="#sdendnote39anc">xxxix</A>
Of these six views, the first two represent the simple antinomy of
eternalism and annihilationism; the view that “no self exists for
me” is not the non-self doctrine of the Buddha, but the
materialist view that identifies the individual with the body and
thus holds that there is no personal continuity beyond death. The
next three views may be understood to arise out of the
philosophically more sophisticated observation that experience has a
builtin reflexive structure that allows for self-consciousness, the
capacity of the mind to become cognizant of itself, its contents,
and the body with which it is inter-connected. Engaged in a search
for his “true nature,” the untaught ordinary person will
identify self either with both aspects of the experience (view 3),
or with the observer alone (view 4), or with the observed alone
(view 5). The last view is a full-blown version of eternalism in
which all reservations have been discarded.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote40">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote40sym" HREF="#sdendnote40anc">xl</A>
The self as speaker represents the conception of the self as the
agent of action; the self as feeler, the conception of the self as
the passive subject. “Here and there” suggests the self as the
transmigrating entity that retains its identity through a succession
of different incarnations. The same view is maintained by the
bhikkhu Sati at MN 38.2.</P>

<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote41sym" HREF="#sdendnote41anc">xli</A>
This is, of course, the formula for the Four Noble Truths, treated
as a subject of contemplation and insight. MA says that up to the
attainment of the path of streamentry, attention denotes insight
(vipassana), but at the moment of the path it denotes
path-knowledge. Insight directly apprehends the first two truths,
since its objective range is the mental and material phenomena
comprised under dukkha and its origin; it can know the latter two
truths only inferentially. Path-knowledge makes the truth of
cessation its object, apprehending it by penetration as object
(arammana). Path-knowledge performs four functions regarding the
four truths: it fully understands the truth of suffering, abandons
the origin of suffering, realises the cessation of suffering, and
develops the way to the cessation of suffering.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote42">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote42sym" HREF="#sdendnote42anc">xlii</A>
The path of stream-entry has the function of cutting off the first
three fetters binding to saxnsara. MA says that personality view and
adherence to rules and observances, being included in the taint of
views, are taints as well as fetters, while doubt is (ordinarily)
classified as only a fetter, not a taint; but because it is included
here among the “taints to be abandoned by seeing,” it may be
spoken of as a taint.</P>

If abandonment of the taints is understood in the strict sense as
their ultimate destruction, then only two of the seven methods
mentioned in the sutta effect their abandonment - seeing and
development - which between them comprise the four supramundane
paths. The other five methods cannot directly accomplish the
destruction of the taints, but they can keep them under control
during the preparatory stages of practice and thereby facilitate
their eventual eradication by the supramundane paths.</P>

These are the seven enlightenment factors (satta bojjhanga) included
among the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment, and treated more
extensively below at MN 10.42 and MN 118.29-40. The present section
explains the seven enlightenment factors specifically as aids for
developing the three higher supramundane paths, by which the taints
that escaped eradication by the first path will be eradicated. The
terms “seclusion” (viveka), “dispassion” (viraga), and
“cessation” (nirodha) may all be understood as referring to
Nibbana. Their use in this context signifies that the development of
the enlightenment factors is directed to Nibbana as its goal during
the preparatory stages of the path, and as its object with the
attainment of the supramundane paths. MA explains that the word
vossagga, rendered as “relinquishment,” has the two meanings of
“giving up” (pariccaga), i.e., the abandonment of defilements,
and “entering into” (pakkhandana), i.e., culminating in Nibbana.</P>

The ten fetters that must be destroyed to gain full deliverance have
been enumerated in the Introduction, pp. 42-43. Conceit, at the most
subtle level, is the conceit “I am,” which lingers in the mental
continuum until the attainment of arahantship. The “penetration of
conceit” (manabhisamaya) means seeing through conceit and
abandoning it, which are both accomplished simultaneously by the
path of arahantship. The bhikkhu has “made an end of suffering”
in the sense that he has put an end to the suffering of the round of
sariisara (vattadukkha).</P>

season, and the rainy season - each lasting for four months. The
four months are subdivided into eight fortnights (pakkha), the third

moon (either the fourteenth or fifteenth) and the night of the
half-moon (the eighth) are regarded as especially auspicious. Within

This is the stock canonical announcement of final knowledge or
arahantship. MA explains that the statement “Birth is destroyed”
means that any type of birth that might have arisen if the path had
not been developed has been rendered incapable of arising by the
development of the path. The “holy life” that has been lived is
the holy life of the path (maggabrahmacariya). The phrase “what
had to be done has been done” (katarim karantyam) indicates that
the four tasks of the noble path - fully understanding suffering,
abandoning its origin, realising its cessation, and developing the
path - have now all been completed for each of the four supramundane
paths. The fourth phrase, napararii itthattaya, is glossed by MA
thus:</P>
<P  >“Now
there is no need for me to develop the path again for ‘such a
state,’ i.e., for the sixteenfold function (of the path) or for
the destruction of the defilements. Or alternatively: after ‘such
a state,’ i.e., the continuum of aggregates now occurring, there
is no further continuum of aggregates for me. These five aggregates,
having been fully understood, stand like trees that are cut at the
root. With the cessation of the last consciousness, they will be
extinguished like a fire without fuel.” I have opted for the
second of these interpretations, but take itthattaya as a dative.
The word, which literally means “the state of this” or “the
state of thus,” implies manifestation in a concrete state of
existence. Nm had rendered: “There is no more of this beyond.”</P>

Anangana Sutta – Without Blemishes</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> MA, picking up on the
venerable Sariputta’s use of the word “person” (puggala),
explains that the Buddha has a twofold teaching - a conventional
teaching (sammutidesana) expressed in terms of persons, beings,
women, and men, etc.; and an ultimate teaching (paramatthadesana)
expressed solely in terms that possess ultimate ontological
validity, such as aggregates, elements, sense bases, impermanent,
suffering, not self, etc. The Buddha expounds his teaching through
whichever approach is best suited to enable the hearer to penetrate
the meaning, dispel delusion, and achieve distinction. The use of
the word “person,” therefore, does not imply a misconception of
the person as a self.</P>

The possessive pronouns qualifying heart are not in the Pali, but
the sense of the phrase has to be understood by consideration of the
simile. Just as Samiti planed the faults out of the felloe as if he
knew Panduputta’s heart with his own heart, so does Sariputta
plane out the faults of the bhikkhus as if he knew Moggallana’s
wish to have them removed. MLS (1:40) misses the point by

Patimokkha is the code of monastic discipline, which in its Pali
version consists of 227 rules. “Resort” (gocara) implies a
proper resort for alms, though it may also signify the proper

fulfilling the precepts signifies the training in higher virtue

mind, not neglect meditation” indicates the training in
concentration or the higher mind (adhicittasikkha); and the phrase
“be possessed of insight” points to the training in the higher
wisdom (adhipannasikkha). The phrase “dwell in empty huts”
combines the latter two trainings, since one resorts to an empty hut
to develop serenity and insight.</P>

from ignorance. The former is normally the result of serenity, the
latter the result of insight. But when they are coupled and

complete uprooting by the supramundane path. The sixteen defilements

The path of stream-entry abandons: contempt, a domineering attitude,
envy, avarice, deceit, fraud.</P>

Views associated with doctrines of a self (attavadapatisamyutta),
according to MA, are the twenty types of personality view enumerated
at MN 44.7, though they may also be understood to include the more
elaborate doctrines about a self discussed in MN 102. Views
associated with doctrines about the world (lokavadapatisarhyutta)
are the eight views: the world is eternal, non-eternal, both, or
neither; the world is infinite, finite, both, or neither. See MN 63

MA: This question refers to one who has only reached the initial
stages of insight meditation without attaining stream-entry. The
type of abandonment under discussion is abandoning by eradication,
which is effected only by the path of stream-entry. Ven. Maha Cunda
posed this question because some meditators were overestimating
their achievement, thinking they had abandoned such views while they
had not really eradicated them.</P>

MA explains that the word “arise” (uppajjanti) refers here to
the arising of views that have not arisen before; “underlie”
(anusenti) to their gathering strength through continued adherence
to them; and being “exercised” (samudacaranti) to their gaining
bodily or verbal expression. The “object” upon which they are
based is the five aggregates (khandha) that constitute a person or

MA explains that the Buddha, having answered the Elder’s question,
now speaks of another type of overestimater - those who attain the
eight meditative attainments and believe that they are practising
true effacement (sallekha). The word sallekha, originally meaning
austerity or ascetic practice, is used by the Buddha to signify the
radical effacing or removal of defilements. Though the eight
attainments are elsewhere placed securely within the Buddhist
training (see MN 25.12-19, MN 26.34-41), it is here said that they
should not be called effacement because the bhikkhu who attains them
does not use</P>
<P >them as a basis for insight - as
described for example in MN 52 and MN 64 - but only as a means of
enjoying bliss and peace.</P>

by “help extinguish” is parinibbapessati, which can also mean
“help attain Nibbana” or “bring to Nibbana.” The Pali
original for the expression to follow, “by which to extinguish
it,” parinibbanaya, might have been rendered “for attaining
Nibbana.” Though in all three cases the alternative rendering

Sammaditthi Sutta – Right View</H5>

mundane and supramundane. Mundane right view is again twofold: the
view that kamma produces its fruits, which may be held both by
Buddhists and outsiders, and the view that accords with the Four
Noble Truths, which is exclusive to the Buddha’s Dispensation.
Supramundane right view is the understanding of the Four Noble
Truths attained by penetrating to the four paths and fruits of
sanctity. The question posed by the Ven. Sariputta concerns the
sekha, the disciple in higher training, who possesses supramundane
right view leading irreversibly to emancipation. This is implied by

MA explains the disciple’s understanding of these four terms by
way of the Four Noble Truths thus: all the courses of action are the
truth of suffering; the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the
truth of the origin; the nonoccurrence of both actions and their
roots is the truth of cessation; and the noble path that realises
cessation is the truth of the path. To this extent a noble disciple

defilements.</P>

The passage from “he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to
lust” until “he makes an end of suffering” shows the work
accomplished by the paths of the nonreturner and of arahantship -
the elimination of the most subtle and obstinate defilements and the
achievement of final knowledge. Here, the underlying tendencies to
sensual lust and aversion are eliminated by the path of the
non-returner, the underlying tendency to the view and conceit “I
am” and ignorance by the path of arahantship. MA explains that the
expression “underlying tendency to the view and conceit I
am’“(asmi ti ditthimananusaya) should be interpreted to mean the
underlying tendency to conceit that is similar to a view because,
like the view of self, it occurs apprehending the notion “I am.”</P>

Nutriment (ahara) is to be understood here in a broad sense as a

contact for feeling, mental volition for consciousness, and
consciousness for mentality-materiality, the psychophysical organism
in its totality. Craving is called the origin of nutriment in that
the craving of the previous existence is the source of the present
individuality with its dependence upon and continual consumption of
the four nutriments in this existence. For an annotated compilation

ignorance by ignorance should be understood to mean that the
ignorance in any one existence is conditioned by the ignorance in
the preceding existence. Since this is so, the conclusion follows
that no first point can be discovered for ignorance, and thus that
sarimsara is without discernible beginning.</P>

Satipatthana Sutta – The Foundation of Mindfulness</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> This is one of the most
important suttas in the Pali Canon, containing the most
comprehensive statement of the most direct way to the attainment of
the Buddhist goal. Virtually the identical sutta is found as well at
DN 22, though with an expanded analysis of the Four Noble Truths
attached, which accounts for its greater length. The sutta, its
commentary, and copious extracts from its difficult but illuminating
subcommentary have been presented together in translation by Soma
Thera in The Way of Mindfulness. A very readable translation of the
sutta, with a modern commentary excelling in clarity and depth, will
be found in Nyanaponika Thera, The Heart of Buddhist Meditation.</P>

<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote135sym" HREF="#sdendnote135anc">cxxxv</A>
The Pali reads ekayano ayam bhikkhave maggo, and virtually all
translators understand this as a statement upholding satipatthana as
an exclusive path. Thus Ven. Soma renders it: “This is the only
way, 0 bhikkhus,” and Ven. Nyanaponika: “This is the sole way,
monks.” Nm, however, points out that ekayana magga at MN 12.37-42
has the unambiguous contextual meaning of “a path that goes in one
way only,” and so he rendered the phrase in this passage, too. The
expression used here, “the direct path,” is an attempt to
preserve this meaning in a more streamlined phrasing. MA explains
ekayana magga as a single path, not a divided path; as a way that
has to be walked by oneself alone, without a companion; and as a way
that goes to one goal, Nibbana. Though there is neither canonical
nor commentarial basis for this view, it might be maintained that
satipatthana is called ekayana magga, the direct path, to
distinguish it from the approach to meditative attainment that
proceeds through the jhanas or brahmaviharas. While the latter can
lead to Nibbana, they do not do so necessarily but can lead to
sidetracks, whereas satipatthana leads invariably to the final goal.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote136">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote136sym" HREF="#sdendnote136anc">cxxxvi</A>
The word satipatthana is a compound term. The first part, sati,
originally meant “memory,” but in Pali Buddhist usage it far
more frequently bears the meaning of attentiveness directed to the
present - hence the makeshift rendering “mindfulness.” The
second part is explained in two ways: either as a shortened form of
upatthana, meaning “setting up” or “establishing” - here, of
mindfulness; or as patthana, meaning “domain” or “foundation”
- again, of mindfulness. Thus the four satipatthanas may be
understood as either the four ways of setting up mindfulness or as
the four objective domains of mindfulness, to be amplified in the
rest of the sutta. The former seems to be the etymologically correct
derivation (confirmed by the Sanskrit sm, tyupasthana), but the Pali
commentators, while admitting both explanations, have a predilection
for the latter.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote137">

<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote138sym" HREF="#sdendnote138anc">cxxxviii</A>
The repetition in the phrase “contemplating the body as a body”
(kaye kayanupassi), according to MA, has the purpose of precisely
determining the object of contemplation and of isolating that object
from others with which it might be confused. Thus, in this practice,
the body should be contemplated as such, and not one’s feelings,
ideas, and emotions concerning it. The phrase also means that the
body should be contemplated simply as a body and not as a man, a
woman, a self, or a living being. Similar considerations apply to
the repetitions in the case of each of the other three foundations
of mindfulness. “Covetousness and grief,” MA says, stands for
sensual desire and ill will, the principal hindrances that must be
overcome for the practice to succeed, enumerated separately below in
§36.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote139">
<P  ><A  NAME="sdendnote139sym" HREF="#sdendnote139anc">cxxxix</A>
The structure of this sutta is fairly simple. Following the
preamble, the body of the discourse falls into four parts by way of
the four foundations of mindfulness:</P>
<P  >I.
Contemplation of the body, which comprises fourteen exercises:
mindfulness of breathing; contemplation of the four postures; full
awareness; attention to foulness; attention to the elements; and
nine “charnel ground contemplations” - reflection on corpses in
different stages of decomposition.</P>
<P  >II.
Contemplation of feeling, considered one exercise.</P>
<P  >III.
Contemplation of mind, also one exercise.</P>
<P  >IV.
Contemplation of mind-objects, which has five subdivisions - the
five hindrances; the five aggregates; the six sense bases; the seven
enlightenment factors; and the Four Noble Truths.</P>
<P  >Thus
the sutta expounds altogether twenty-one exercises in contemplation.
Each exercise in turn has two aspects: the basic exercise, explained
first, and a supplementary section on insight (essentially the same
for all the exercises), which indicates how the contemplation is to
be developed to deepen understanding of the phenomenon under
investigation.</P>
<P >Finally the sutta concludes with a
statement of assurance in which the Buddha personally vouches for
the effectiveness of the method by declaring the fruits of
continuous practice to be either arahantship or non-returning.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote140">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote140sym" HREF="#sdendnote140anc">cxl</A>
The practice of mindfulness of breathing (anapanasati) involves no
deliberate attempt to regulate the breath, as in hatha yoga, but a
sustained effort to fix awareness on the breath as it moves in and
out in its natural rhythm. Mindfulness is set up at the nostrils or
the upper lip, wherever the impact of the breath is felt most
distinctly; the length of the breath is noted but not consciously
controlled. The complete development of this meditation method is
expounded in MN 118. For an organised collection of texts on this
subject, see Bhikkhu Nanamoli, Mindfulness of Breathing. See too Vsm
VIII, 145-244.</P>

The “bodily formation” (kayasankhara) is defined at MN 44.13 as

“Externally”: contemplating the breathing occurring in the body
of another. “Internally and externally”: contemplating the
breathing in his own body and in the body of another alternately,
with uninterrupted attention. A similar explanation applies to the
refrain that follows each of the other sections, except that under
the contemplation of feeling, mind, and mind-objects, the
contemplation externally, apart from those possessing telepathic
powers, must be inferential.</P>

conditions on account of which the body has arisen - namely,
ignorance, craving, kamma, and food - together with the concrete
fact of the moment-bymoment origination of material phenomena in the
body. In the case of mindfulness of breathing, an additional arising
factor mentioned by the commentaries is the physiological apparatus
of respiration. The “vanishing factors” (vayadhamma) for the

not abandoning the subject of meditation during one’s daily
routine; and full awareness of reality, the knowledge that behind
one’s activities there is no abiding self. See The Way of

Mind (citta) as an object of contemplation refers to the general
state and level of consciousness. Since consciousness itself, in its
own nature, is the bare knowing or cognizing of an object, the
quality of any state of mind is determined by its associated mental
factors, such as lust, hate, and delusion or their opposites, as
mentioned by the sutta.</P>

The paired examples of citta given in this passage contrast states
of mind of wholesome and unwholesome, or developed and undeveloped
character. An exception, however, is the pair “contracted” and
“distracted,” which are both unwholesome, the former due to
sloth and torpor, the latter due to restlessness and remorse. MA
explains “exalted mind” and “unsurpassed mind” as the mind
pertaining to the level of the jhanas and immaterial meditative
attainments, and “unexalted mind” and “surpassed mind” as
the mind pertaining to the level of sense-sphere consciousness.
“Liberated mind” must be understood as a mind temporarily and
partly freed from defilements through insight or the jhanas. Since
the practice of satipatthana pertains to the preliminary phase of
the path aimed at the supramundane paths of deliverance, this last
category should not be understood as a mind liberated through
attainment of the supramundane paths.</P>

The five hindrances (pancanivarana) are the main inner impediments
to the development of concentration and insight. Sensual desire
arises through attending unwisely to a sensually attractive object
and is abandoned by meditation on a foul object (as in §10 and

repugnant object and is abandoned by developing loving-kindness;
sloth and torpor arise by submitting to boredom and laziness and are
abandoned by arousing energy; restlessness and remorse arise through
unwisely reflecting on disturbing thoughts and are abandoned by
wisely reflecting on tranquillity; doubt arises through unwisely
reflecting on dubious matters and is abandoned by study,
investigation, and inquiry. The hindrances are fully eradicated only

The Pali idiom, n’eva kamupadanam upadiyati, would have to be
rendered literally as “he does not cling to the clinging to sense
pleasures,” which may obscure the sense rather than convey it.
Upadana in Pali is the object of its own verb form, while “clinging”
in English is not. At one stage in his translation Nm tried to
circumvent this problem by borrowing the word upadana’s other
meaning of “fuel” and translating: “he no longer clings to
sensual desires [as fuel for] clinging.” This, however, also
borders on obscurity, and I have therefore attempted to cut through
the difficulty by translating directly in accordance with the sense
rather than in conformity with the literal idiom.</P>

According to MA, Mahanama had long ago attained the fruit of the
once-returner, which only weakens greed, hate, and delusion but does
not eradicate them. MA says that he had the mistaken notion that
greed, hate, and delusion are eradicated by the path of the
once-returner. Thus, when he saw that they still arose in his mind,
he realised that they were not abandoned and inquired from the
Buddha the cause for their arising. Noble disciples can be mistaken
about which defilements are abandoned by which path.</P>

The “rapture and pleasure that are apart from sensual pleasures”

wear off the accumulations of past evil kamma. The purpose of this

“Bhikkhus, I do not dispute with the world, it is the world that
disputes with me. A speaker of Dhamma does not dispute with anyone
in the world.” The second part may be taken to mean that, for the

The interpretation of this cryptic passage hinges on the word
papanca and the compound papanca-sauna-sankha. Nm had translated the
former as “diversification” and the latter as “calculations
about perceptions of diversification.” It seems, however, that the
primary problem to which the term papanca points is not
“diversification,” which may be quite in place when the sensory
field itself displays diversity, but the propensity of the
worldling’s imagination to erupt in an effusion of mental
commentary that obscures the bare data of cognition. In a penerative
study, Concept and Reality in Early Buddhism, Bhikkhu Nanananda
explains papanca as “conceptual proliferation,” and I follow him
in substituting “proliferation” for Nm’s “diversification.”
The commentaries identify the springs of this proliferation as the
three factors - craving, conceit, and views - on account of which
the mind “embellishes” experience by interpreting it in terms of
“mine,” “I” and “my self.” Papanca is thus closely akin
to the mannana, “conceiving,” of MN 1 - see n.6.</P>
<P  >The
compound papanca-sauna-sankha is more problematic. Ven. Nanananda
interprets it to mean “concepts characterised by the mind’s
prolific tendency,” but this explanation still leaves the word
sauna out of account. MA glosses sankha by kotthasa, “portion,”
and says that sauna is either perception associated with papanca or
papanca itself. I go along with Ven. Nanananda in taking sankha to
mean concept or notion (Nm’s “calculation” is too literal)
rather than portion. My decision to treat sauna-sankha as a dvanda
compound, “perceptions and notions,” may be questioned, but as
the expression papanca-sanna-sankha occurs but rarely in the Canon
and is never verbally analysed, no rendering is utterly beyond
doubt. On alternative interpretations of its components, the
expression might have been rendered “notions [arisen from] the
proliferation of perceptions” or “perceptual notions [arisen
from] proliferation.”</P>
<P >The sequel will make it clear that the
process of cognition is itself “the source through which
perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a man.”
If nothing in the process of cognition is found to delight in, to
welcome, or to hold to, the underlying tendencies of the defilements
will come to an end.</P>

This passage shows how papanca, emerging from the process of
cognition, gives rise to perceptions and notions that overwhelm and
victimise their hapless creator. Ms contains a note by Nm: “The
meeting of eye, form, and eye-consciousness is called contact.
Contact, according to dependent origination, is the principal
condition of feeling. Feeling and perception are inseparable (MN
43.9). What is perceived as ‘this’ is thought about in its
differences and is thus diversified from ‘that’ and from ‘me.’
This diversification - involving craving for form, wrong view about
permanence of form, etc., and the conceit ‘I am’ - leads to
preoccupation with calculating the desirability of past and present
forms with a view to obtaining desirable forms in the future.”
Perhaps the key to the interpretation of this passage is Ven. Maha
Kaccana’s explanation of the Bhaddekaratta verses in MN 133. There
too delight in the elements of cognition plays a prominent role in
causing bondage, and the elaboration of the verses in terms of the
three periods of time links up with the reference to the three times
in this sutta.</P>

“that one will describe a description. of contact.” “To point

the meaning without jeopardising intelligibility. MA says that this

the ten wholesome courses of action. The five “signs” (nimitta)

“other sign” is attention to impermanence. When thoughts of hate
arise directed towards living beings, the “other sign” is the
meditation on loving-kindness; when they are directed to inanimate
things, the “other sign” is attention to the elements (see MN

Though the Pali uses the one word kama in all four cases, from the

Dhamma pi vo pahatabba pageva adhamma. MA identifies the good states
with serenity and insight (samatha-vipassana), and paraphrases the
meaning: “I teach, bhikkhus, even the abandoning of desire and
attachment to such peaceful and sublime states as serenity and
insight, how much more so to that low, vulgar, contemptible, coarse,
and impure thing that this foolish Arittha sees as harmless when he
says that there is no obstruction in desire and lust for the five
cords of sensual pleasure.” The commentator cites MN 66.26-33 as
an example of the Buddha teaching the abandonment of attachment to
serenity, MN 38.14 as an example of his teaching the abandonment of
attachment to insight. Note that it is in each case the attachment
to the good states that should be abandoned, not the good states
themselves. The Buddha’s injunction is not an invitation to moral
nihilism or a proposal that the enlightened person has gone beyond
good and evil. In this connection see MN 76.51.</P>

This section evidently has the purpose of forestalling another type
of misconception and misrepresentation of the Dhamma, i.e., the
introduction of a view of self into the teaching. According to MA,
standpoints for views (ditthitthana) are wrong views themselves as
grounds for other more elaborate wrong views; the objects of views,
i.e., the five aggregates; and the conditions for views, i.e., such
factors as ignorance, perverted perception, and false thoughts, etc.</P>

the notion “this I am” by conceit, and the notion “this is my

This is a full-fledged eternalist view arisen on the basis of one of

identity of the self with the universe, though this interpretation

According to the commentaries, disenchantment (nibbida, also

stages of insight, dispassion (viraga) the attainment of the

“Thus gone” is, in Pali, tathagata, the usual epithet of the
Buddha, but here applied more broadly to the arahant. MA interprets
this passage in two alternative ways thus: (1) The arahant even
while alive is here and now untraceable as a being or individual (in
the sense of an abiding self) because in the ultimate sense there is
no being (as self). (2) The arahant is untraceable here and now
because it is impossible for the gods, etc., to find the support for
his insight-mind, path-mind, or fruition-mind (vipassanacitta,
maggacitta, phalacitta); that is, the object being Nibbana, his mind

The import of this statement is deeper than appears on the surface.

stating that he teaches that a living being is not a self but a mere
conglomeration of factors, material and mental events, linked
together in a process that is inherently dukkha, and that Nibbana,
the cessation of suffering, is not the annihilation of a being but
the termination of that same unsatisfactory process. This statement

says that one with right view, who has discarded all doctrines of a
self, sees that whatever arises is only dukkha arising, and whatever

These are two classes of individuals standing on the path of

faculty of faith (saddhindriya) is predominant and who develop the
noble path with faith in the lead; when they attain the fruit they

insight meditation who have not reached any supramundane attainment.
Note that they are headed only for heaven, not for enlightenment,
though if their practice matures they can attain the path of
stream-entry and thus gain assurance of enlightenment. The
expression saddhamattath pemamattarn might be rendered “simply
faith, simply love” or “mere faith, mere love” (as it
sometimes is), but this could not explain the guarantee of rebirth
in heaven. It therefore seems obligatory to take the suffix matta
here as implying a requisite amount of faith and love, not simple
possession of these qualities.</P>

Although these seven purifications (satta visuddhi) are mentioned
elsewhere in the Pali Canon (at DN iii.288, with two added:
purification by wisdom and purification by deliverance), it is
curious that they are not analysed as a set anywhere in the Nikayas;
and this becomes even more puzzling when both these great disciples
seem to recognise them as a fixed group of doctrinal categories. The
sevenfold scheme forms, however, the scaffolding for the entire
Visuddhimagga, which defines the different stages by means of the
fully developed commentarial traditions on concentration and insight
meditation.</P>
<P >In brief, “purification of virtue”
(silavisuddhi) is the unbroken adherence to the moral precepts one
has undertaken, explained by Vsm with reference to the moral
training of a bhikkhu as the “fourfold purification of virtue.”
“Purification of mind” (cittavisuddhi) is the overcoming of the
five hindrances through the attainment of access concentration and
the jhanas. “Purification of view” (ditthivisuddhi) is the
understanding that defines the nature of the five aggregates
constituting a living being. “Purification by overcoming doubt”
(kankhavitaranavisuddhi) is the understanding of conditionality.
“Purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what
is not the path” (maggamaggananadassanavisuddhi) is the correct
discrimination between the false path of the ecstatic, exhilarating
experiences and the true path of insight into impermanence,
suffering, and not self. “Purification by knowledge and vision of
the way” (patipadananadassanavisuddhi) comprises the ascend ing
series of insight knowledges up to the supramundane paths. And
“purification by knowledge and vision” (nanadassanavisuddhi) is
the supramundane paths.</P>

Nibbana that has no condition,” explaining that upadana has two
meanings: grasping (gahana), as in the usual passage on the four
types of clinging; and condition (paccaya), as illustrated by this
passage. The commentators explain “final Nibbana without clinging”
either as the fruit of arahantship, because it cannot be grasped by
any of the four types of clinging; or as Nibbana the unconditioned,
because it has not arisen through any condition.</P>

Upadhi: The root meaning is foundation, basis, ground (PED). In the
commentaries various kinds of upadhi are enumerated, among them the
five aggregates, objects of sensual pleasure, defilements, and
kamma. Nm renders the term consistently throughout as “essentials
of existence,” which often obscures its clear contextual meaning.
I have tried to capture the several connotations of the word by
rendering it “objects of attachment” where its objective meaning
is prominent (as it is here) and as “attachment” where its
subjective meaning is prominent. At MN 26.19 Nibbana is called “the
relinquishing of all attachments” (sabb’upadhipatinissagga),
with both mean ings intended.</P>

That is, it leads to rebirth in the plane of existence called the

aeons, but when that has elapsed one must pass away and return to a
lower world. Thus one who attains this is still not free from birth

Both Horner in MLS and Nm in Ms err in their translations of the
account of the Bodhisatta’s meeting with Uddaka Ramaputta by
assuming that Uddaka is identical with Rama. However, as his name

spiritual. Rama himself must have already passed away before the
Bodhisatta arrived on the scene. It should be noted that all
references to Rama are in the past tense and the third person, and
that Uddaka in the end places the Bodhisatta in the position of
teacher. Though the text does not allow for definite conclusions,
this suggests that he himself had not yet reached the fourth
immaterial attainment.</P>

Alaya. It is difficult to find for this word a suitable English
equivalent that has not already been assigned to a more frequently
occurring Pali term. Horner renders it as “sensual pleasure,”
which appropriates the usual rendering of kama and may be too
narrow. In Ms and in other published works Nm translates it as
“something to rely on,” which may draw upon a connotation of the
word that is not the one intended here. MA explains alaya as
comprising both objective sense pleasures and the thoughts of
craving concerned with them; thus “worldliness” has been chosen

MA raises the question why, when the Bodhisatta had long ago made an
aspiration to reach Buddhahood in order to liberate others, his mind
now inclined towards inaction. The reason, the commentator says, is
that only now, after reaching enlightenment, did he become fully
cognizant of the strength of the defilements in people’s minds and
of the profundity of the Dhamma. Also, he wanted Brahma to entreat
him to teach so that beings who venerated Brahma would recognise the

takes up the truth of suffering for analysis into its various
aspects (§3). From among these, he selects the last and enumerates
the five aggregates affected by clinging (§4). He next selects the
first aggregate, that of material form (§5). Taking up each of the
great elements in turn, he shows it as having two aspects - internal
and external - the former being selected for detailed analysis, the
latter only briefly mentioned for the sake of completeness and
comparison (e.g., §§6-7). Each of the elements is expounded as a
basis for insight meditation as well as for developing patience,
faith, and equanimity (e.g., §§8-10). Having finished examining
the elements, Ven. Sariputta next takes up the aspects of the Four
Noble Truths he earlier had put aside. He introduces derivative
material form by way of the sense faculties and their objects (§27,
etc.), then he relates this to the other four aggregates of the
first noble truth, and finally he sets this whole complex of ideas
in relation to the other three noble truths (§28, etc.).</P>

Here, however, it is used in a more general sense as applicable to
the entire body insofar as it is grasped as “mine” and
misapprehended as a self. The phrase “whatever else” is intended
to include the earth element comprised in those parts of the body
not included in the above enumeration. According to the Abhidhamma
analysis of matter, the four primary elements are inseparable, and
thus each element is also included, though in a subordinate role, in
the bodily phenomena listed under the other three elements.</P>

MA explains that this passage, referring to a bhikkhu who practises
meditation on the elements, is intended to show his strength of mind
in applying his comprehension of things to undesirable objects
arisen at the “door” of the ear. By contemplating the experience
by way of conditionality and impermanence, he transforms the
potentially provocative situation of being subjected to abuse into
an opportunity for insight.</P>

Tassa dhata.rammanam eva cittarh pakkhandati. This sentence can be
construed in two alternative ways, depending on how the compound
dhatarammanam is understood. Ven. Nyanaponika takes it as the object
of the verb pakkhandati, and he understands dhatu here as “an
impersonal element in general” capable of including sound,
contact, feeling, etc. Thus he translates: “And his mind enters
into that very object [taking it just as an impersonal] element.”
Nm reads the compound as an adjunct qualifying citta, and supplies
the object of the verb in parenthesis. MA seems to support the
former reading; MT explicitly identifies dhatu as the earth element,
thus supporting the latter reading. MA explains the phrase “acquires
decision” to mean that the meditator contemplates the situation by
way of elements and thus has neither attachment nor aversion
concerning it.</P>

the virtues of the bhikkhu who can endure such abuse without giving
rise to a mind of hate. “Equanimity supported by the wholesome”

equanimity of neither attraction nor aversion towards agreeable and
disagreeable objects that appear at the six sense doors. Strictly

This section is set forth, according to MA, to introduce the
material form derived from the four great elements. Derived material
form, according to the Abhidhamma analysis of matter, includes the
five sense faculties (pasadarupa) and the first four kinds of sense
object, the tangible object being identified with the primary
elements themselves. “Corresponding (conscious) engagement”
(tajjo samannaharo) is explained by MA as attention (manasikara)
arising in dependence on the eye and forms; it is identified with
the “five-door adverting consciousness”
(pancadvaravajjanacitta), which breaks off the flow of the life
continuum (bhavanga) to initiate a process of cognition. Even when
forms come into range of the eye, if attention is not engaged by the
form because one is occupied with something else, there is still no
manifestation of the “corresponding class of consciousness,”

Abhidhamma. Though the word cannot refer here to the Pitaka of that
name - obviously the product of a phase of Buddhist thought later

approach to the doctrine that served as the original nucleus of the

word “Abhidhamma” occurs in the Sutta Pitakas of several early
recensions, the Japanese Pali scholar Fumimaro Watanabe concludes
that the Buddha’s own disciples formed the conception of
Abhidhamma as an elementary philosophical study that attempted to

relations. See his Philosophy and its Development in the Nikayas and

wished to dedicate the merit to the Licchavis. But the Buddha
replies that the Licchavis will gain the merit of providing Saccaka

Because he does not see the Buddhist bhikkhus engaged in

“development of mind” concentration. When the noble disciple
experiences pleasant feeling, he does not become overwhelmed by it
because, through his development of insight, he understands the
feeling to be impermanent, unsatisfactory, and essenceless; and when

MA explains this passage as follows: “Everything” (sabbe dhamma)
is the five aggregates, the twelve bases, the eighteen elements.
These are “not worth adhering to” by way of craving and views
because they turn out in actuality to be different from the way they
are grasped: grasped as permanent, pleasurable, and self, they turn
out to be impermanent, suffering, and not self. He “directly
knows” them as impermanent, suffering, and not self, and “fully
understands” them by scrutinising them in the same way.
“Contemplating impermanence,” etc., is accomplished by the
insight knowledges of rise and fall and of destruction and
disappearance. “He does not cling” to any formation by way of
craving and views, does not become agitated because of craving, and
personally attains Nibbana by the extinguishing of all defilements.</P>

Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta – The Greater Discourse on the Destruction
of Craving</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> According to MA, through
faulty reasoning based on the fact of rebirth, Sati came to the
conclusion that a persisting consciousness transmigrating from one
existence to another is necessary to explain rebirth. The first part
of the sutta (down to §8) replicates the opening of MN 22, the only
difference being in the view espoused.</P>

MA: The purpose of the simile is to show that there is no
transmigration of consciousness across the sense doors. Just as a
log fire burns in dependence on logs and ceases when its fuel is
finished, without transmigrating to faggots and becoming reckoned as
a faggot fire, so too, consciousness arisen in the eye door
dependent on the eye and forms ceases when its conditions are
removed, without transmigrating to the ear, etc., and becoming
reckoned as ear-consciousness, etc. Thus the Buddha says in effect:
“In the occurrence of consciousness there is not even the mere
transmigration from door to door, so how can this misguided Sati
speak of transmigration from existence to existence?”</P>

Bhutam idan ti. MA: “This” refers to the five aggregates. Having
shown the conditionality of consciousness, the Buddha states this
passage to show the conditionality of all the five aggregates, which
come into being through conditions, their “nutriment,” and pass
out of being with the ceasing of those conditions. In the following
tadaharasambhavam, MA takes the tad as a nominative representing the
subject (= tam khandhapancakam), but it seems more likely that it
qualifies ahara and that both should be taken as ablatives, the
subject idam being understood. This interpretation seems confirmed
by the third statement, tadaharani.rodha yam bhutam tam
nirodhadhammam. Horner’s “This is the origination of nutriment”
is clearly wrong.</P>

On the four nutriments, see n.120. MA: The Buddha states this

This is a statement of the abstract principle of dependent
origination exemplified by the twelvefold formula. The abstract
principle on cessation is stated at §22. Nm had rendered the
principle of arising thus: “That is when this is; that arises with
the arising of this.” And the principle of cessation: “That is
not when this is not; that ceases with the cessation of this.”</P>

The following portion of the discourse may be understood as a
concrete application of dependent origination - so far expressed
only as a doctrinal formula - to the course of individual existence.
The passage §§26-29 may be taken to show the factors from
consciousness through feeling that result from past ignorance and
formations, §40 the causal factors of craving and clinging as they
build up a continuation of the samsaric round. The following section
(§§31-40), connecting dependent origination to the appearance of
the Buddha and his teaching of the Dhamma, shows the practice of the
Dhamma to be the means of bringing the round to an end.</P>

MA explains that he delights in the painful feeling by clinging to
it with thoughts of “I” and “mine.” In confirmation of the

This statement reveals that the chain of dependent origination is
broken at the link between feeling and craving. Feeling arises
necessarily because the body acquired through past craving is
subject to the maturation of past kamma. However, if one does not
delight in feeling, craving will not have the opportunity to arise
and set off reactions of like and dislike that provide further fuel
for the round, and thus the round will come to an end.

Shame (hiri) and fear of wrongdoing (ottappa) are two complementary

Saleyyaka Sutta – The Brahmins of Sala</H3>
<P ><SUP></SUP> This is a morally
nihilistic materialist view that denies an afterlife and kammic

fruit of giving; “no this world, no other world” that there is
no rebirth into either this world or a world beyond; “no mother,

It should be noted that while “conduct in accordance with the

rebirth in the higher heavenly worlds and for the destruction of the
taints, it is by no means a sufficient condition. Rebirth into the
realms beginning with the gods of Brahma’s retinue requires the
attainment of jhana, rebirth into the Pure Abodes (the five
beginning with the Aviha gods) the attainment of the stage of
non-returner, rebirth into the immaterial planes the corresponding
immaterial attainments, and the destruction of the taints requires
the full practice of the Noble Eightfold Path up to the path of

According to MA, the understanding of the Four Noble Truths being
discussed here is penetration by the supramundane path. Thus the
lowest type of person to be described as “one who is wise”
(pannava) is the person on the path of stream-entry. The rendering
of patina as “wisdom” (which I substituted for Nm’s
“understanding”) has the disadvantage of severing the tie,
evident in the Pali, with the verb pajanati. To preserve the
connection, here and in the preceding paragraph, the verb has been
rendered “wisely understand.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote430">

The Pali phrase defining consciousness uses only the verb, vijanati
vijanati, and this could as well be understood to mean “One
cognizes, one cognizes.” Although Nm had translated this phrase
without any pronoun, the pronoun has been inserted for greater

and perception at §7 and §8 have been similarly augmented by the
addition of the pronoun.</P>

MA: The question concerns the consciousness with which the person
described as “one who is wise” examines formations; that is, the
consciousness of insight by which that person arrived (at his
attainment), the mind which does the work of meditation. Ven.
Sariputta answers by explaining the meditation subject of feeling,
in the way it has come down in the Discourse on the Foundations of
Mindfulness (MN 10.32). The Pali construction, sukhan ti pi
vijanati, indicates that the feeling is being treated as a direct
object of consciousness rather than as an affective tone of the
experience; to show this the words “this is” have been supplied

MA: There are twelve immeasurable deliverances of mind: the four
brahmaviharas, the four paths, and the four fruits. The unshakeable
deliverance of mind is the fruit of arahantship. The statement that
this unshakeable deliverance is void of lust, hate, and delusion -

the supramundane deliverance of mind through voidness.</P>

The word kincana is explained by MA as meaning “impediment” or

MA interprets the phrase “maker of signs” (nimitta karana) to
mean that lust, hate, and delusion brand a person as a worldling or
a noble one, as lustful, hating, or deluded. But it may also mean
that these defilements cause the mind to ascribe a false

beautiful.</P>

MA: There are thirteen signless deliverances of mind: insight,

all names for Nibbana, which is the object of the fruition

MA explains the compound panc’upadanakkhandha as the five
aggregates that become the condition for clinging (MT: as its
objects). Since these five aggregates are, in brief, the entire
noble truth of suffering (MN 9.15; 28.3), it will be seen that the
first four questions pose an inquiry into the Four Noble Truths
expressed in terms of personality rather than suffering.</P>

These are the twenty kinds of personality view. MA quotes Pts
1.144-45 to illustrate the four basic modes of personality view in
regard to material form. One may regard material form as self, in
the way the flame of a burning oil-lamp is identical with the colour
(of the flame). Or one may regard self as possessing material form,
as a tree possesses a shadow; or one may regard material form as in
self, as the scent is in the flower; or one may regard self as in
material form, as a jewel is in a casket.</P>

The word khandha here has a different meaning than in the more

The four foundations of mindfulness are the basis of concentration
(samadhinimitta) in the sense of being its condition (MA). Here it

MA: Dhammadinna anticipated Visakha’s intention to ask about the
formations that cease when one enters the attainment of cessation.

wholesome and unwholesome volitions of body, speech, and mind, the

MA explains further that the bodily formation and the mental
formation are said to be formations “bound up” with the body and
the mind in the sense that they are formed by the body and by the
mind, while the verbal formation is a formation in the sense that it
forms speech. The verb form vitakketva vicaretva has been rendered
in a way that maintains consistency with the rendering of the nouns
vitakka and vicara as “applied thought” and “sustained
thought.”</P>

Cessation can be attained only by a non-returner or an arahant with
mastery over the eight jhanic attainments. The meditator enters each
attainment in turn, emerges from it, and contemplates it with
insight as impermanent, suffering, and not self. After completing
this procedure with the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and attending to certain
preliminaries, the meditator determines to be without mind for a
particular length of time. His determination, backed by his previous
accomplishments and preparations, leads him into the attainment of
cessation. See Vsm XXIII, 32-43.</P>

MA: When one emerges from cessation, the consciousness of fruition
attainment arises first, and the perception and feeling associated
with that are the mental formation that arises first. Then, with the
subsequent descent into the life continuum, the bodily formation,

resumes his ordinary activity, the verbal formation arises.</P>

because of that longing is elsewhere called “the grief based on

abandon the tendency to aversion by means of that grief; rather,
spurred on by the longing for the supreme liberations, one takes up
the practice with firm determination and eradicates the tendency to
aversion by attaining the path of the non-returner.</P>

Brahmanimantanika Sutta – The Invitation of a Brahma</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The Mulapariyaya Sutta (MN
1) was also delivered by the Buddha while he was living in the
Subhaga Grove at Ukkattha, and the similarity in formulation and
theme between these two suttas - perhaps the only two recorded as
originating at Ukkattha - is striking. It is even possible to see
the present sutta as a dramatic representation of the same ideas set
forth by the Mulapariyaya in abstract philosophical terms. Thus Baka
the Brahma may be taken to represent being or personality in its
most eminent form, blindly engaged in the activity of conceiving,
sustaining itself with its delusions of permanence, pleasure, and
selfhood. Underlying being is craving, symbolised by Mara -
seemingly inconspicuous in the assembly, yet the real author of all
the outpourings of conceiving, the one who holds the entire universe
in his grip. The alliance of Brahma and Mara, God and Satan, an
incomprehensible union from the perspective of Western theism,
points to the thirst for continued being as the hidden root of all
world affirmation, whether theistic or non-theistic. In the sutta
the superficial theoretical contest between Baka and the Buddha soon
gives way to a gripping deep-level confrontation between Mara and
the Buddha - Mara as craving demanding the affirmation of being, the
Enlightened One pointing to the cessation of being through the
uprooting of delight.</P>

A similar encounter between the Buddha and Baka is recorded at SN

held this eternalist view with regard to both his own individual

In the Brahmajala Sutta (DN 1.2.2-6/ii.17-19) the Buddha shows how

dissolution, a being of great merit is the first to be reborn in the
newly formed Brahmaworld. Subsequently, other beings take rebirth in
the Brahma-world and this causes Maha Brahma to imagine that he is

This passage, parallel in structure to the corresponding passage of
MN 1, is a difficult one. The difficulty centres around the verb
used in the first four statements regarding earth, about which there
is not even certainty as to the correct reading. Nm prefers the BBS
ed. reading apahosim, which he takes to be an aorist of pabhavati,
meaning “to produce, to give being to.” MA glosses: “I did not
grasp earth through the obsessions of craving, conceit, and views.”
Nm had rendered ananubhutam as “not co-essential with.” This has
been replaced by “not commensurate with,” following MA’s
gloss, “not reached by earth” and MT: “Its nature is not
shared in common with earth.” MA says that what is “not

These lines (which also appear as part of a full verse at DN
11.85/i.223) have been a perennial challenge to Buddhist
scholarship, and even Acariya Buddhaghosa seems to founder over
them. MA takes the subject of the sentence to be Nibbana, called
“consciousness” in the sense that “it can be cognized.” This
is obviously a contrived derivation, since nowhere in the Canon is
Nibbana ever described as consciousness. MA offers three
explanations of the phrase sabbato pabham: (1) completely possessed
of splendour (pabha); (2) possessing being (pabhutam) everywhere;
and (3) a ford (pabham) accessible from all sides, i.e., through any
of the thirty-eight meditation objects. Only the first of these
seems to have any linguistic legitimacy. Nm, in Ms, explains that he
takes pabham to be a negative present participle of pabhavati -
apabham - the negative-prefix a dropping off in conjunction with
sabbato: “The sense can be paraphrased freely by ‘not
predicating being in relation to “all,’“or ‘not assuming of
“all” that it is or is not in an absolute sense.’“</P>

This passage states clearly and explicitly the regulations on

that the Buddha does not require the bhikkhus to observe a
vegetarian diet, but permits them to consume meat when they are
confident that the animal has not been slaughtered especially to
provide them with food. Such meat is called tikotiparisuddha, “pure
in three aspects,” because it is not seen, heard, or suspected to
come from an animal killed specifically for the bhikkhu. The lay
Buddhist’s precept of abstaining from the taking of life would
prohibit him from killing for his food, but does not proscribe
purchasing meat prepared from animals already dead. For more on this

Danda, originally a stick or staff, acquires the meaning of rod as
an instrument of punishment, and subsequently comes to mean
punishment or infliction itself, even without reference to an

The Buddha may have said this because in his teaching volition
(cetana), a mental factor, is the essential ingredient of kamma, and
in its absence - that is, in the case of unintentional bodily or
verbal activity - no kamma is created. MA, however, maintains that
the Buddha said this referring to wrong view with fixed consequences
(niyata miccha ditthi), and it quotes in support AN 1:18.3/i.33:
“Bhikkhus, I see nothing so blameworthy as wrong view. Wrong view
is the most blameworthy of all things.” These types of wrong view

This statement, at DN 2.29/i.57, is ascribed to the Nigantha
Nataputta himself as a formulation of the Jain doctrine. Nm points
out in Ms that it may involve a pun on the word vari, which can mean
both “water” and “curb” (from vareti, to ward off). In my
translation of the Samannaphala Sutta, The Discourse on the Fruits
of Recluseship, p. 24, I render it based on the Digha commentary as
follows: “A Nigantha is restrained with regard to all water; he is
endowed with the avoidance of all evil; he is cleansed by the
avoidance of all evil; he is suffused with the avoidance of all
evil.” Though the statement conveys a concern for moral purity,
the tone is decidedly different from that of the Buddha’s
teachings.</P>

The three views discussed in §§5, 13 and 21 are called wrong views
with fixed evil result (niyata miccha ditthi). To adhere to them

</P>
<P  >The
examination of these views unfolds according to the following
pattern: The Buddha discloses the wrong view A and its antithesis B.
Taking up A for examination first, in A.i he shows the pernicious
effect of this view on bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. In A.ii
he proceeds from the judgement that the view is actually wrong and
elicits additional negative consequences of its adoption.</P>
<P  >Then
in A.iii he shows how a wise person comes to the conclusion that
whether or not the view is true, it serves his best interest to
reject it.</P>
<P  >Next,
position B is considered. In B.i the Buddha describes the wholesome
influence of this view on conduct. In B.ii he elicits additional
positive consequences of adopting such a view. And in B.iii he shows

This doctrine of non-doing (akiriyavada), in the Samannaphala Sutta

first encounter the view seems to rest on materialist premises, as
the previous nihilistic view does, there is canonical evidence that
Purana Kassapa subscribed to a fatalistic doctrine. Thus his moral
antinomianism probably follows from the view that all action is
predestined in ways that abrogate the ascription of moral
responsibility to its agent. See Basham, History and Doctrines of

Mahamalunkya Sutta – The Greater Discourse to Malunkyaputta</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The five lower fetters
(orambhagiyani sahyojanani) are so called because they lead to
rebirth in the sense-sphere planes. They are eradicated in their
entirety only by the non-returner.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote650">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote650sym" HREF="#sdendnote650anc">dcl</A>
MA: The question may be raised: “When the Buddha had asked about
the fetters and the Elder replied in terms of the fetters, why does
the Buddha criticise his reply?” The reason is that Malunkyaputta
held the view that a person is fettered by the defilements only at
times when they assail him, while at other times he is not fettered
by them. The Buddha spoke as he did to show the error in this view.</P>

Anuseti tvev’assa sakkayaditthanusayo. On the anusayas or
underlying tendencies, see n.473. In the commentaries the
defilements are distinguished as occurring at three levels: the
anusaya level, where they remain as mere latent dispositions in the
mind; the pariyutthana level, where they rise up to obsess and
enslave the mind (referred to in §5 of this discourse); and the
vitikkama level, where they motivate unwholesome bodily and verbal
action. The point of the Buddha’s criticism is that the fetters,
even when they do not come to active manifestation, continue to
exist at the anusaya level so long as they have not been eradicated
by the supramundane path.</P>

This passage shows the development of insight (vipassana) upon a
basis of serenity (samatha), using the jhana on which the practice
of insight is based as the object of insight contemplation. See MN
52.4 and n.552. Here two terms - impermanent and disintegrating -
show the characteristic of impermanence; three terms - alien, void,
and not self - show the characteristic of non-self; the remaining
six terms show the characteristic of suffering.</P>

MA: He “turns his mind away” from the five aggregates included
within the jhana, which he has seen to be stamped with the three
characteristics. The “deathless element” (amata dhatu) is
Nibbana. First “he directs his mind to it” with the insight
consciousness, having heard it praised and described as “the
peaceful and sublime,” etc. Then, with the supramundane path, “he
directs his mind to it” by making it an object and penetrating it
as the peaceful and sublime, etc.</P>

MA: Among those who proceed by way of serenity, one bhikkhu
emphasises unification of mind - he is said to gain deliverance of
mind; another emphasises wisdom - he is said to gain deliverance by
wisdom. Among those who proceed by way of insight, one emphasises
wisdom - he is said to gain deliverance by wisdom; another
emphasises unification of mind - he is said to gain deliverance of
mind. The two chief disciples attained arahantship by emphasising
both serenity and insight, but Ven. Sariputta became one who gained
deliverance by wisdom and Ven. Maha Moggallana became one who gained
deliverance of mind. Thus the reason (for the different
designations) is the difference in their faculties, i.e., between
the predominance of the concentration faculty and of the wisdom
faculty.</P>

Both Nm and Horner take sankameyya here to mean that the bhikkhu
makes himself a plank, i.e., lies down across the mud. This,
however, is contradicted by Bhaddali’s negative answer. Thus it
would seem more correct to take this verb to mean that he crosses
over himself (as the verb literally does mean), in disregard of the
Buddha’s injunction. MA points out that the Buddha would never
give such a command to his disciples, but only says this to
emphasise the recalcitrant behaviour of Bhaddali.</P>

Latukikopama Sutta – The Simile of the Quail</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> From this passage and that
to follow, it appears that the Buddha restricted the allowable time
for bhikkhus’ meals in two successive stages, first prohibiting
only the afternoon meal and allowing a night meal. However, in the
Vinaya account of the origin of Pac 37 (Vin iv.85) no mention is
made of this successive prohibition. To the contrary, the text seems
to assume that it is an item of common knowledge that monks should
not consume food past noon, and it shows the Buddha laying down the
rule against untimely eating with one complete pronouncement valid
for all meals past noon.</P>

Here I have departed from Nm in rendering sukha as “bliss”

jhanas as nekkhammasukha because they yield the bliss of renouncing
sensual pleasures; as pavivekasukha because they yield the bliss of
being secluded from the crowd and from defilements; as upasamasukha
because their bliss is for the purpose of quieting down the
defilements; and as sambodhasukha because their bliss is for the

MA explains that even though part of the statement is valid, the
Buddha rejects the entire statement because of the portion that is
invalid. The part of the statement that is valid is the assertion
that the Buddha is omniscient and all-seeing; the part that is
excessive is the assertion that knowledge and vision are
continuously present to him. According to the Theravada tradition
the Buddha is omniscient in the sense that all knowable things are
potentially accessible to him. He cannot, however, know everything
simultaneously and must advert to whatever he wishes to know. At MN

MA explains “the fetter of householdership” (gihisamyojana) as
attachment to the requisites of a householder, which MT details as
land, ornaments, wealth, grain, etc. MA says that even though the
texts mention some individuals who attained arahantship as laymen,
by the path of arahantship they destroyed all attachment to worldly
things and thus either went forth as monks or passed away
immediately after their attainment. The question of lay arahants is
discussed at Miln 264.</P>

Aggivacchagotta Sutta – To Vacchagotta on Fire</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The view that the soul
(jiva) and the body are the same is materialism, which reduces the

The view that a Tathagata exists after death is a form of eternalism
that regards the Tathagata, or spiritually perfect individual, as
possessing a self that attains eternal deliverance after the death
of the body. The view that a Tathagata does not exist after death
also identifies the Tathagata as self, but holds that this self is
annihilated upon the death of the body. The third view attempts a
synthesis of these two, which the Buddha rejects because both
components involve a wrong view. The fourth view seems to be a
sceptical attempt to reject both alternatives or to avoid taking a
definite stand.</P>

gone to any direction, so the Tathagata who has attained to final
Nibbana cannot be described in terms of the four alternatives. The

usage and is not intended to suggest, as some scholars have held,
that the Tathagata attains to some mystical absorption in the
Absolute. The words “profound, immeasurable, unfathomable” point
to the transcendental dimension of the liberation attained by the
Accomplished One, its inaccessibility to discursive thought.</P>

Dighanakha Sutta – To Dighanakha</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> Dighanakha was Ven.
Sariputta’s nephew. At the time he approached the Buddha,
Sariputta had been a bhikkhu for only two weeks and was still a
stream-enterer.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote731">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote731sym" HREF="#sdendnote731anc">dccxxxi</A>
MA holds that Dighanakha is an annihilationist (ucchedavadin) and
explains this assertion to mean: “No [mode of] rebirth is
acceptable to me.” However, the text itself does not give any
concrete evidence supporting this interpretation. It seems much more
likely that Dighanakha’s statement, “Nothing is acceptable to
me” (sabbam me na khamati), is intended to apply specifically to
other philosophical views, and thus shows Dighanakha to be a radical
sceptic of the class satirically characterised at MN 76.30 as
“eel-wrigglers”. His assertion would then be tantamount to a
wholesale repudiation of all philosophical views.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote732">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote732sym" HREF="#sdendnote732anc">dccxxxii</A>
This exchange, as interpreted by MA and MT, should be understood as
follows: The Buddha suggests, by his question, that Dighanakha’s
assertion involves an inherent contradiction. For he cannot reject
everything without also rejecting his own view, and this would
entail the opposite position, namely, that something is acceptable
to him. However, though Dighanakha recognises the implication of the
Buddha’s question, he continues to insist on his view that nothing
is acceptable to him.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote733">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote733sym" HREF="#sdendnote733anc">dccxxxiii</A>
MA says that the first sentence refers to those who first take up a
basic eternalist or annihilationist view and then subsequently adopt
secondary variations on that view; the second sentence refers to
those who abandon their basic view without adopting an alternative.
But if, as seems plausible, Dighanakha was a radical sceptic, then
the Buddha’s statement might be understood to point to an
unsatisfactoriness inherent in the sceptic’s position: it is
psychologically uncomfortable to insist on remaining in the dark.
Thus most sceptics, while professing a rejection of all views,
surreptitiously adopt some definite view, while a few abandon their
scepticism to seek a path to personal knowledge.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote734">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote734sym" HREF="#sdendnote734anc">dccxxxiv</A>
MA identifies the three views here as eternalism, annihilationism,
and partial eternalism. The eternalist view is close to lust
(saragaya santike), etc., because it affirms and delights in
existence in however sublimated a form; annihilationism is close to
non-lust, etc., because, though involving a wrong conception of
self, it leads to disenchantment with existence. If the second view
is understood as radical scepticism, it could also be seen as close
to non-lust in that it expresses disillusionment with the attempt to
buttress the attachment to existence with a theoretical foundation
and thus represents a tentative, though mistaken, step in the
direction of dispassion.</P>

their proponents - inconsistently with their own principles - did
observe celibacy and practise austerities. The “four kinds of holy

In the Samannaphala Sutta the view that follows, as far as “the

(DN 2.26/i.56). However, in that sutta the following passage on the
elaborate system of classifications, down to “fools and the wise
both will make an end of suffering,” is connected with the view of
non-causality and follows immediately upon the statement of the
doctrine of non-causality set forth in this sutta at §13. The
entire view is there assigned to Makkhali Gosala. Since there are
evident connections between the non-causality doctrine and items in
the system of classifications (e.g., the reference to the “six
classes”), and since both are known to have been typical of the
AjIvaka movement headed by Makkhali Gosala, it seems that the
inclusion of this system of classifications here under the doctrine
of the seven bodies came about through an error of oral
transmission. The correct version would thus be the one preserved by
the Digha Nikaya. For the commentary on the system of

second is the attainment of the jhanas using a kasina derived from

“transcending” of the forms is the attainment of absorption
together with the arising of the sign. The perception “I know, I
see” is the advertence (abhoga) that occurs after he emerges from
the attainment, not within the attainment. The second base of

outline applicable to the sekha, the disciple in higher training.

can assume a wider range of meaning than “virtue.”</P>

MA explains that this refers to the fruit of stream-entry, for it is
at that point that the virtue of restraint by the Patimokkha is
fulfilled (and, for a lay Buddhist, the observance of the Five
Precepts). MA will also explain the subsequent passages by reference
to the other supramundane paths and fruits. Although the text of the
sutta does not expressly mention these attainments, the commentarial
interpretation seems to be justified by the expression “cease
without remainder” (aparisesa nirujjhanti), for it is only with
the attainment of the respective paths and fruits that a total
cessation of the particular defilement occurs. The commentary’s
view is further supported by the culmination of the entire discourse
in the figure of the arahant.</P>

Evariivanno atta hoti arogo param marana. The word arogo, normally
meaning healthy, here should be understood to mean permanent. MA
says that he speaks with reference to rebirth in the heavenly world

Previous translators seem to have been perplexed by the verb
anassama. Thus Nm in Ms renders the line: “We don’t renounce our
teachers’ doctrines for this reason.” And Horner: “We have
heard to here from our own teachers.” But anassama is a
first-person plural aorist of nassati, “to perish, to be lost.”
The same form occurs at MN 27.7. MA explains that they knew that in
the past meditators would do the preparatory work on the kasina,
attain the third jhana, and be reborn in the world of Refulgent
Glory. But as time went on, the preparatory work on the kasina was
no longer understood and meditators were not able to attain the
third jhana. The wanderers only learned that “an entirely pleasant
world” exists and that the five qualities mentioned at §21 were
the “practical way” to it. They knew of no entirely pleasant
world higher than the third jhana, and of no practical way higher
than the five qualities.</P>

the Buddha taught him two long suttas to provide him with a

white cloth, but subsequently modified the rule to allow bhikkhus to
step on a cloth as a blessing for householders.</P>

studied at Takkasila, where he became his teacher’s favourite. His
fellow students, jealous of him, told the teacher that Ahimsaka had
committed adultery with his wife. The teacher, intent on bringing
Ahimsaka to ruin, commanded him to bring him a thousand human
righthand fingers as an honorarium. Ahimsaka lived in the Jalini
forest, attacking travellers, cutting off a finger of each, and
wearing them as a garland around his neck. At the time the sutta
opens he was one short of a thousand and had made a determination to
kill the next person to come along. The Buddha saw that Angulimala’s

experienced in any life subsequent to the next, as long as one’s
sojourn in samsara continues. Because he had attained arahantship,

first, since even arahants are susceptible to experiencing the
present-life results of actions they performed before attaining
arahantship.</P>

MA’s explanation of this reply suggests that the former class of
gods are non-returners, while the latter class are gods who have not
attained the status of non-returners. The same would apply to the
question on Brahmas in §15. The two key terms that here distinguish
the two types of gods appear in the PTS ed. as savyapajjha and
abyapajjha, which would be rendered as “subject to ill will” and
“free from ill will,” respectively. The BBS ed. reading accepted
here, sabyabajjha and abyabajjha, has the support of MA, which
glosses the former as “who have not abandoned mental suffering by
eradicating it,” and the latter as “who have eradicated
suffering.” As either reading would be applicable to
non-returners, no significant difference is entailed. Note that the
word itthatta, which in the stock declaration of arahantship
signifies any state of manifest existence, is here glossed by MA as
manussaloka, the human world.</P>

Brahmayu Sutta - Brahmayu</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> This is a stock
description of a learned brahmin. According to MA, the Three Vedas
are the Iru, Yaju, and Sama (= Rig, Yajur, and Saman). The fourth
Veda, the Atharva, is not mentioned, but MA says its existence is
implied when the histories (Itihasa) are called “the fifth,”
i.e., of the works regarded as authoritative by the brahmins. It is
more likely, however, that the histories are called “the fifth”
in connection with the four branches of study auxiliary to the Vedas
that precede them in the description. The translation of technical
terms here follows MA, with the help of Monier-William’s
SanskritEnglish Dictionary (Oxford, 1899). On the marks of a Great
Man, MA says that this was a science based on 12,000 works
explaining the characteristics of great men, such as Buddhas,
paccekabuddhas, chief disciples, great disciples, Wheel-turning
Monarchs, etc. These works included 16,000 verses called “The
Buddha Mantra.”</P>

MA explains limiting action (pamanakatam kammarh) as kamma
pertaining to the sense sphere (kamavacara). It is contrasted with a
limitless or immeasurable action, namely, the jhanas pertaining to
the fine-material sphere or the immaterial sphere, In this case the
brahmaviharas developed to the jhanic level are intended. When a
jhana pertaining to the fine-material sphere or the immaterial
sphere is attained and mastered, a kamma pertaining to the sense
sphere cannot overpower it and gain the opportunity to yield its own
result. Rather, the kamma pertaining to the fine-material sphere or
the immaterial sphere overpowers the sense-sphere kammas and
produces its results. Obstructing the result of the sense-sphere
kammas, the brahmavihara that has been mastered leads to rebirth in
the company of Brahma.</P>

it is the root of the suffering comprised in the five aggregates.
The passage shows two alternative approaches toward overcoming
craving - one employing energetic striving, the other detached
equanimity. The “fading away” of the source is identified by MA
with the supramundane path. The passage is said to illustrate the
practice of one who progresses on a pleasant path with quick direct

In the Brahmajala Sutta sixteen varieties of this view are
mentioned, the eight given here and two other tetrads: the self as
finite, infinite, both, and neither; and the self as experiencing
exclusively pleasure, exclusively pain, a mixture of both, and
neither. In the present sutta these two tetrads are incorporated
under speculations about the past in §14.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote938">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote938sym" HREF="#sdendnote938anc">cmxxxviii</A>
Evidently, in the above list the views of the self as immaterial,
percipient of unity, and percipient of the immeasurable are based on
attainment of the base of infinite space. MT explains the
consciousness-kasina as the base of infinite consciousness, stating
that these theorists declare that base to be the self.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote939">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote939sym" HREF="#sdendnote939anc">cmxxxix</A>
The perception within the third immaterial meditation - the base of
nothingness - is the subtlest and most refined of all mundane
perceptions. Although there is still a kind of perception in the
fourth immaterial attainment, it is so subtle that it is considered
no longer appropriate to designate it perception.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote940">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote940sym" HREF="#sdendnote940anc">cmxl</A>
MA paraphrases thus: “All those types of perceptions together with
the views are conditioned, and because they are conditioned, they
are gross. But there is Nibbana, called the cessation of formations,
that is, of the conditioned. Having known ‘There is this,’ that
there is Nibbana, seeing the escape from the conditioned, the
Tathagata has gone beyond the conditioned.”</P>

MA explains the compound ditthasutamutavinnatabba as meaning “what

refer to sense-door cognitions. However, it can also comprise all
grosser mind-door cognitions as well. To enter the fourth immaterial
attainment, all the ordinary “mental formations” involved in
other cognitive processes must be overcome, for their persistence is
an obstacle to entering this attainment. Hence it is called “not
percipient” (n’eva sanni).</P>

The “fear and disgust with personality” is an aspect of

So far only four of the original five classes of speculations about
the future have been analysed, yet the Buddha speaks as if they were
all explicated. MA tries to resolve the problem by explaining that
assertions of “Nibbana here and now” were comprised by the terms
“percipient of unity” and “percipient of diversity” in §3.
This explanation, however, is not convincing. Nm, in Ms, had added
the heading “Nibbana Here and Now” over §17, and §§17-21 do
seem to correspond with the last four of the five doctrines of
Nibbana here and now in the Brahmajala. However, this interpretation
seems contradicted by §13 and by the phrase used in §17, §19 and
§21, “with the relinquishing of views about the past and the
future,” which would exclude the doctrines of Nibbana here and
now. The problem seems insoluble, and raises the question whether a
passage on Nibbana here and now was not lost in the course of the
sutta’s oral transmission. In the Brahmajala the five doctrines
are the assertion of sensual pleasures and the four jhanas to be the
self’s attainment of supreme Nibbana here and now.</P>

Any offence of the two classes, parajika and sanghadisesa; see
n.987. The analogy is difficult to apply with complete precision,
since if craving and ignorance had truly been removed from him with
only a trace left behind, the bhikkhu would be a sekha; yet it is
inconceivable that a sekha would abandon the training or commit a
defiled offence. It seems that in this case the analogy must be
applied loosely, and the bhikkhu should be understood as one who
falsely imagines that craving and ignorance have been removed from
him.</P>

MA explains the phrase “his mind acquires confidence in this base”
to mean that he attains either insight aimed at reaching arahantship
or the access to the fourth jhana. If he gains access to the fourth
jhana, this becomes his basis for attaining “the imperturbable,”
i.e., the fourth jhana itself. But if he gains insight, then he
decides upon perfecting wisdom by deepening his insight in order to
reach arahantship. The decision “to perfect wisdom” may explain
why so many of the following sections of this sutta, though
culminating in attainments along the scale of concentration, are
expressed in phrasing appropriate to the development of insight.</P>

<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1011sym" HREF="#sdendnote1011anc">mxi</A>
MA explains that this passage describes the rebirth process of one
who could not realise arahantship after reaching the fourth jhana.
The “consciousness leading [to rebirth]” (sarhvattanikam
vinnanam) is the resultant consciousness by which this person is
reborn, and this has the same imperturbable nature as the kammically
formative consciousness that attained to the fourth jhana. Since it
is the fourth-jhana consciousness that determines rebirth, this
person will be reborn in one of the celestial realms corresponding
to the fourth jhana.</P>

reborn in the plane of infinite space.</P>

is expounded by way of insight rather than concentration, the
approach taken in the previous section. At MN 43.33, this
contemplation is said to lead to the deliverance of mind through
voidness.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1016">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1016sym" HREF="#sdendnote1016anc">mxvi</A>
MA calls this four-pointed voidness and explains thus: (i) he does
not see his self anywhere; (ii) he does not see a self of his own
that can be treated as something belonging to another, e.g., as a
brother, friend, assistant, etc.; (iii) he does not see the self of
another; (iv) he does not see the self of another that can be
treated as something belonging to him. Ms has a note by Nm: “These
expressions [in this paragraph and the next] seem to have been
stereotyped slogans or descriptions of the attainments of
nothingness and neither-perception-nor-non-perception, primarily
non-Buddhist, and sometimes used as a basis for the existing-body

the five aggregates. The first part of the formula again seems to be

a philosophical riddle appearing also at Sri 588, Sri 757, and Ud

that in whatever way worldly people conceive any of the five
aggregates - as self or self’s belonging, etc. - the thing
conceived turns out to be other than the aspect ascribed to it: it
is not self or self’s belonging, not “I” or “mine.”</P>

Bahudhatuka Sutta – The Many Kinds of Elements</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The eighteen elements are
defined at Vbh §§183-84/ 87-90 and are explained in detail at Vsm
XV, 17-43. Briefly, the mind element (manodhatu), according to the
Abhidhamma, includes the consciousness that adverts to the five
sense objects impinging on the five sense faculties
(pancadvaravajjana-citta) and the consciousness that receives the
object after it has been cognized through the senses
(sampaticchana-citta). The mind-consciousness element
(manovinnanadhatu) includes all types of consciousness except the
five sense consciousnesses and the mindelement. The mind-object
element (dhammadhatu) includes the types of subtle material
phenomena not involved in sense cognition, the three mental
aggregates of feeling, perception, and formations, and Nibbana. It
does not include concepts, abstract ideas, judgements, etc. Though
these latter are included in the notion of mind-object
(dhammarammana), the mind-object element includes only things that
exist by their own nature, not things constructed by the mind.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1078">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1078sym" HREF="#sdendnote1078anc">mlxxviii</A>
These are defined at Vbh §180/85-86. The pleasure and pain elements
are bodily pleasant and painful feeling; the joy and grief elements
are mental pleasant and painful feeling; the equanimity element is
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. MA says that ignorance is
brought in because of its apparent similarity to the equanimity
element.</P>

MA: A person possessing right view (ditthisampanno) is one

MA points out that a noble disciple below the level of arahantship
can still apprehend formations as pleasurable with a mind
dissociated from wrong view, but he cannot adopt the view that any
formation is pleasurable. Although perceptions and thoughts of
formations as pleasurable arise in him, he knows reflectively that
such notions are mistaken.</P>

In the passage on self, sankhara, “formation,” is replaced by
dhamma, “thing.” MA explains that this substitution is made to
include concepts, such as a kasina sign, etc., which the ordinary
person is also prone to identify as self. However, in view of the
fact that Nibbana is described as imperishable (accuta) and as bliss
(sukha), and is also liable to be misconceived as self (see MN
1.26), the word sankhara may be taken to include only the
conditioned, while dhamma includes both the conditioned and the
unconditioned. This interpretation, however, is not endorsed by the
commentaries of Acariya Buddhaghosa.</P>

Pubbangama, lit. “the forerunner.” MA says that two kinds of
right view are forerunners: the right view of insight, which
investigates formations as impermanent, suffering, and non-self; and
the right view of the path, which arises as a consequence of insight
and effects the radical destruction of defilements. The right view
of insight as the forerunner seems to be shown in §§4, 10, 16, 22

This definition defines supramundane right view as the wisdom
(panna) found among the requisites of enlightenment as a faculty,
power, enlightenment factor, and path factor. The definition is
formulated by way of the cognitive function rather than the
objective content of the view. Elsewhere (MN 141.24) the right view
of the path is defined as knowledge of the Four Noble Truths. We may
understand that the conceptual comprehension of the four truths
falls under mundane right view, while the direct penetration of the
truths by realising Nibbana with the path constitutes supramundane
right view.</P>

MA: This statement refers exclusively to the co-existent factors
accompanying supramundane right intention. In the preliminary phase
of the practice, the three mundane right intentions arise
separately, but at the moment of the supramundane path, a single
right intention arises cutting off the threefold wrong intention.

intention of renunciation, non-ill will, and non-cruelty. The same

jhanas and the third all four jhanas. The mental formation is
perception and feeling (see MN 44.14), which is tranquillised by the
development of successively higher levels of serenity and insight.</P>

“Experiencing the mind” is to be understood by way of the four
jhanas. “Gladdening the mind” is explained either as the
attainment of the two jhanas containing rapture or as the
penetration of those jhanas with insight as subject to destruction,
etc. “Concentrating the mind” refers either to the concentration
pertaining to the jhana or to the momentary concentration that
arises along with insight. “Liberating the mind” means
liberating it from hindrances and grosser jhanic factors by
successively higher levels of concentration, and from the cognitive
distortions by way of insight knowledge.</P>

This tetrad deals entirely with insight, unlike the previous three,
which deal with both serenity and insight. “Contemplating fading
away” and “contemplating cessation” can be understood both as
the insight into the impermanence of formations and as the
supramundane path realising Nibbana, called the fading away of lust
(i.e., dispassion, viraga) and the cessation of suffering.
“Contemplating relinquishment” is the giving up of defilements
through insight and the entering into Nibbana by attainment of the
path.</P>

desire and ill will, and thus represent the contemplation of
mind-objects, which begins with the five hindrances. The bhikkhu

of impermanence, fading away, cessation, and relinquishment, and

Sankharupapatti Sutta - Reappearance by Aspiration</H5>

Although I have attempted to render sankhara consistently throughout
as “formations,” here it seemed that the content required a
different rendering to bring the intended meaning to light. Nm had
used “determinations,” his own consistent choice for sankhara.
MA initially explains sankharupapatti as meaning either reappearance
(i.e., rebirth) of mere formations, not of a being or person, or
reappearance of the aggregates in a new existence through a
meritorious kamma formation. However, in subsequent passages,. MA
glosses sankhara with patthana, a word unambiguously meaning
aspiration.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1133">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1133sym" HREF="#sdendnote1133anc">mcxxxiii</A>
MA: “The way” is the five qualities beginning with faith,

mind, i.e., knowing the thoughts of the beings throughout a thousand
worlds; pervasion of the kasina, i.e., extending the kasina image to
a thousand worlds; pervasion of the divine eye, i.e., seeing a
thousand worlds with the divine eye; pervasion of light, which is
the same as the previous pervasion; and pervasion of body, i.e.,
extending one’s bodily aura to a thousand worlds.</P>

destruction of the taints, more is required. Basing oneself on the
five qualities, if one attains the jhanas, one is reborn in the
Brahma-world; if one attains the immaterial attainments, one is

MA explains that this was merely a rhetorical question, since the
Buddhas can know by direct knowledge whatever they wish to know. The
Buddha asked this with the thought in mind: “As soon as these
bhikkhus form into a society and delight in society, they will act
in improper ways. I shall expound the Great Practice of Voidness

MA: The Buddha begins the present passage in order to ward off the
criticism that while he enjoins his disciples to live in solitude,
he himself is often surrounded by a large retinue. “Voidness”
here is the fruition attainment of voidness; see n.1137.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1152">

MA explains voidness internally as that connected with one’s own
five aggregates, voidness externally as that connected with the
aggregates of others. The voidness spoken of here thus must be the
temporary deliverance of mind reached through the insight
contemplation of non-self, as explained at MN 43.33. When the
insight into non-self is brought to the level of the path, it issues
in the fruition experiencing Nibbana by way of its aspect of
voidness.</P>

If, after emerging from the basic jhana, his mind does not enter
into voidness through insight contemplation on his own aggregates or
those of others, and he also cannot attain the imperturbable
immaterial attainment, he should return to the same basic jhana that

Acariyupaddava, antevasupaddava, brahmacariyupaddava. Upaddava may

speaks the present passage to show the danger in solitude when one
does not fulfil the proper purpose of solitary living. The “teacher”

MA: The going forth into homelessness outside the Dispensation
brings small gain, so one who falls away from that falls away only
from mundane attainment; he meets with no great suffering, as one
who falls from the back of a donkey merely becomes covered with
dust. But the going forth in the Buddha’s Dispensation brings
great gain - the paths, fruits, and Nibbana. Thus one who falls away
from this meets great suffering, like one who falls from the back of

The contrast in this simile is between the way the potter treats the
raw damp clay and the way he treats the baked pots produced from the
clay. MA paraphrases: “After advising once I shall not be silent;
I shall advise and instruct by repeatedly admonishing you. Just as
the potter tests the baked pots, puts aside those that are cracked,
split, or faulty, and keeps only those that pass the test, so I
shall advise and instruct by repeatedly testing you. Those among you
who are sound, having reached the paths and fruits, will stand the
test.” MA adds that the mundane virtuous qualities are also

Bhaddekaratta Sutta – One Fortunate Attachment</H5>

<P  ><A  NAME="sdendnote1210sym" HREF="#sdendnote1210anc">mccx</A>
Ms contains the following note by Nm on this expression, which
accounts for the title of this and the following three suttas:</P>
<P  >This
term has elsewhere been translated by “true saint” and like
phrases, which, however, quite miss the point. The commentary says
only this: “Bhaddekarattassa means ‘of one who is fortunate
(bhadda) in having one (eka) attachment (ratta or ratti)’; this is
because of his possessing application to insight.” The
subcommentary resolves the compound ekaratta (one-attachment) into
eka ratti, and says only that “bhaddekaratta means one who has a
fortunate single attachment (bhaddo ekaratto etassa); it is a term
for a person who is cultivating insight.” There appears to be no
other mention of this term elsewhere in the Canon and its
commentaries.</P>
<P  >The
Pali word ratta (adj.) or ratti (n.) in this instance is from the
root raj, “to take pleasure in.” So the “bhaddekaratta”
appears to be the one who is applying himself invincibly,
unshakeably, to know and to study the present state as it occurs
(see verse). This application of attachment is auspicious or
fortunate because it leads to liberation … It might be supposed
that the expression “bhaddekaratta” was a popular phrase taken
over by the Buddha and given a special sense by him, as was not
infrequently done, but there seems to be no reason to do so and
there is no evidence for it in this case. It is more likely to be a
term coined by the Buddha himself to describe a certain aspect of
development.</P>
<P >Ven. Nanananda, in the introduction to
his translation, offers an argument for rendering the term “the
ideal lover of solitude.” Horner renders it simply as “the
Auspicious.”</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote1211">

More literally the first two lines would be translated: “Let not a
person run back to the past or live in expectation of the future.”
The meaning will be elucidated in the expository passage of the

Asamhiram asankuppam. MA explains that this is said for the purpose
of showing insight and repeated insight; for insight is “invincible,
unshakeable” because it is not vanquished or shaken by lust and
other defilements. Elsewhere the expression “the invincible, the
unshakeable” is used as a description of Nibbana (e.g., Sn v.1149)
or of the liberated mind (e.g., Thag v.649), but here it seems to
refer to a stage in the development of insight. The recurrence of
the verb form samhtrati in §8 and §9 suggests that the intended
meaning is contemplation of the present moment without being misled
into the adoption of a personality view.</P>

MA: One “finds delight” by bringing to bear upon the past either
craving or a view associated with craving. It should be noted that
it is not the mere recollection of the past through memory that
causes bondage, but the reliving of past experiences with thoughts
of craving. In this respect the Buddha’s teaching differs
significantly from that of Krishnamurti, who seems to regard memory
itself as the villain behind the scene.</P>

Perhaps this sentence, and all the parallel sentences to follow,
should be translated: “One does not find delight there thinking,
‘I had such material form in the past.’“The translation as it
stands suggests that such thoughts arise but without the
accompaniment of delight, while the alternative proposed here
suggests that these thoughts do not arise at all. The same
alternative construction can also be applied to thoughts about the
future in §7. The Pali can admit either rendering.</P>

Culakammavibhanga Sutta – The Shorter Exposition of Action</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> See MN 99. According to
MA, his father, the Brahmin Todeyya, was reborn as a dog in his own
house because of his extreme stinginess. The Buddha identified him
to Subha by getting the dog to dig up some hidden treasure Subha’s
father had buried before his death. This inspired Subha’s
confidence in the Buddha and moved him to approach and inquire about
the workings of kamma.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1224">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1224sym" HREF="#sdendnote1224anc">mccxxiv</A>
If the kamma of killing directly determines the mode of rebirth, it
will produce rebirth in one of the states of deprivation. But if a
wholesome kamma brings about a human rebirth - and rebirth as a
human being is always the result of wholesome kamma - the kamma of
killing will operate in a manner contrary to that of the
rebirthgenerative kamma by causing various adversities that may
reach their peak in a premature death. The same principle holds for
the subsequent cases in which unwholesome kamma comes to maturity in
a human existence: in each case the unwholesome kamma counteracts
the wholesome kamma responsible for the human rebirth by engendering
a specific type of misfortune corresponding to its own distinctive
quality.</P>

Mahakammavibhanga Sutta - The Greater Exposition of Action</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> MA says that Potaliputta
did not actually hear this personally from the Buddha, but had heard
a report that these statements were made by the Buddha. The former
is a distorted version of the Buddha’s declaration at MN 56.5 that
mental action is the most reprehensible of the three types of deeds
for the performance of evil action. The latter derives from the
Buddha’s discussion of the cessation of perception in the
Potthapada Sutta (DN 9). MA glosses the word “vain” by
“fruitless.”</P>

MA: The person who was seen with the divine eye killing living
beings, etc., is reborn in hell because of another evil deed he had
done earlier than the deed of killing, etc., or because of an evil
deed he did afterwards, or because of a wrong view he accepted at
the time of death. Although the Pali seems to be saying that he was
necessarily reborn in hell on account of some action other than the
one he was seen performing, this should not be understood as an
apodictic pronouncement but only as a statement of possibility. That
is, while it may be true that he was reborn in hell because of the
evil action he was seen performing, it is also possible that he was
reborn there because of some other evil action he did earlier or
later or because of wrong view.</P>

Buddha, having announced that he will teach a summary and an
exposition, should recite only the summary and leave without giving

he had not previously declared his intention to give an exposition.

All known editions of the Pali text of MN 138 read here anupada
paritassana, literally “agitation due to non-clinging,” which
obviously contradicts what the Buddha consistently teaches: that
agitation arises from clinging, and ceases with the removal of
clinging. However, this reading apparently precedes the time of the
commentaries, for MA accepts anupada as correct and offers the
following explanation: “In what sense is there agitation due to
non-clinging? Through the non-existence of anything to cling to. For
if there existed any formation that were permanent, stable, a self,
or the belonging of a self, it would be possible to cling to it.
Then this agitation would be agitation due to clinging (something to
cling to). But because there is no formation that can be clung to
thus, then even though material form, etc., are clung to with the
idea ‘material form is self,’ etc., they are not clung to (in
the way they are conceived). Thus, what is here called ‘agitation
due to non-clinging’ is in meaning agitation due to clinging by
way of views.” Nm had followed this reading, and on the basis of
MA’s explanation, had rendered the phrase “anguish [agitation]
due to not finding anything to cling to.” He did not discuss the
problem in his notes.</P>
<P >A sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya (SN
22:7/iii, 16) is virtually identical with this passage of MN 138,
except that here it reads, as we should expect, upada paritassana,
“agitation due to clinging.” From the Sarnyutta text we may
safely infer that the Majjhima reading is an ancient error that
should be discounted. My rendering here is based on the reading of
SN 22:7. Homer too follows the latter text in MLS.</P>

Dhatuvibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of the Elements</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> According to MA, Pukkusati
had been the king of Takkasila and had entered into a friendship
with King Bimbisara of Magadha through merchants who travelled
between the two countries for purposes of trade. In an exchange of
gifts Bimbisara sent Pukkusati a golden plate on which he had
inscribed descriptions of the Three Jewels and various aspects of
the Dhamma. When Pukkusati read the inscription, he was filled with
joy and decided to renounce the world. Without taking formal
ordination, he shaved his head, put on yellow robes, and left the
palace. He went to Rajagaha intending to meet the Buddha, who was
then in Savatthi, about 300 miles away. The Buddha saw Pukkusati
with his clairvoyant knowledge, and recognising his capacity to
attain the paths and fruits, he journeyed alone on foot to Rajagaha
to meet him. To avoid being recognised, by an act of will the Buddha
caused his special physical attributes such as the marks of a Great
Man to be concealed, and he appeared just like an ordinary wandering
monk. He arrived at the potter’s shed shortly after Pukkusati had
arrived there intending to leave for Savatthi the next day in order
to meet the Buddha.</P>

Pannadhitthana, saccadhitthana, cagadhitthana, upasamadhitthana. Nm,
in Ms, had first rendered adhitthana as “resolve,” and then
replaced it with “mode of expression,” neither of which seems
suitable for this context. MA glosses the word with patittha, which
clearly means foundation, and explains the sense of the statement
thus: “This person who consists of the six elements, the six bases
of contact, and the eighteen kinds of mental approach - when he
turns away from these and attains arahantship, the supreme
accomplishment, he does so established upon these four bases.” The
four foundations will be individually elucidated by the sequel,

the relinquishing of all defilements by the path of arahantship.
From the start one should train in the pacification of defilements

to MA, Pukkusati had already achieved the fourth jhana and had a

The sense is: If he attains the base of infinite space and should
pass away while still attached to it, he would be reborn in the
plane of infinite space and would live there for the full lifespan
of 20,000 aeons specified for that plane. In the higher three
immaterial planes the lifespan is respectively 40,000 aeons, 60,000

MA: This is said in order to show the danger in the immaterial
jhanas. By the one phrase, “This would be conditioned,” he
shows: “Even though the lifespan there is 20,000 aeons, that is
conditioned, fashioned, built up. It is thus impermanent, unstable,
not lasting, transient. It is subject to perishing, breaking up, and
dissolution; it is involved with birth, ageing, and death, grounded
upon suffering. It is not a shelter, a place of safety, a refuge.
Having passed away there as a worldling, one can still be reborn in
the four states of deprivation.”</P>

The sense of this instruction might be explained with the help of MA
thus: One is dependent because of craving and views and becomes
independent by abandoning them with the attainment of arahantship.
Bias (nati, lit. bending) comes about through craving, and its
absence means there is no inclination or desire for existence. There
is no coming and going by the ending of rebirth and death, no here
nor beyond nor in between by the transcendence of this world, the
world beyond, and the passage between one and the other. This is the
end of the suffering of defilements and the suffering of the round.</P>

Truths. Delight (nandT) is an aspect of craving. Through the arising
of delight in regard to the eye and forms there arises the suffering
of the five aggregates. Thus in this first part of the instruction
the Buddha teaches the round of existence by way of the first two
truths - suffering and its origin - as they occur through the six
senses. In the second part (§4) he teaches the ending of the round
by way of the second two truths - cessation and the path - expressed
as the abandoning of delight in the six senses and their objects.</P>

Sangha stipulated that every fortnight the bhikkhunis should request
the bhikkhus to send a bhikkhu for the purpose of giving them an

been a king and those bhikkhunis had been his concubines. He wanted
to avoid his turn in advising the bhikkhunis because he thought that
another bhikkhu possessing the knowledge of past lives, seeing him
giving an exhortation surrounded by the bhikkhunis, would think that
he still could not separate himself from his former concubines. But
the Buddha saw that Nandaka’s discourse to the bhikkhunis would

The truth of suffering is shown by the term “personality,”

operative, the three factors of the morality group having been

Beginning with this section a sequence of development may be
discerned. The abandoning of the five cords of sensual pleasure is
the preliminary step for developing the jhanas, and the abandoning
of the five hindrances (§10) the immediate antecedent to the
attainment of the first jhana. The full understanding of the five
aggregates (§11) indicates the insight wisdom necessary to attain
the path of stream-entry, and the sections on the thirty-seven
requisites of enlightenment (§§12-18) the cultivation of the
factors needed to arrive at the intermediate stages of sanctity. The
section on serenity and insight (§19), though applicable to all
stages, can be seen as fully actualised by the non-returner striving

Indriyabhavana Sutta - The Development of the Faculties</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The expression “the
development of the faculties” (indriyabhavana) properly signifies
the development of the mind in responding to the objects experienced
through the sense faculties. The more rudimentary aspect of this
practice, the restraint of the sense faculties (indriyasathvara),
involves controlling the mind in such a way that one does not grasp
at the “signs and features” of things, their distinctive
attractive and repulsive attributes. The development of the
faculties carries this process of control through to the point
where, by an act of will, one can immediately set up insight even in
the course of sense perception. At the highest level one acquires
the ability to radically transform the subjective significance of
perceptual objects themselves, making them appear in a mode that is
the very opposite of the way they are normally apprehended.</P>

MA explains that when a desirable form comes into range of the eye,
an agreeable state (manapa) arises; when an undesirable form
appears, a disagreeable state (amanapa) arises; and when an
indifferent form appears, a state that is both agreeable and
disagreeable arises. It should be noted that though these three
terms are ordinarily used to qualify the sense objects, here they
also seem to signify subtle states of liking, aversion, and dull
indifference that arise due to the influence of the underlying
tendencies. MT identifies “the agreeable” with wholesome and
unwholesome states of mind associated with joy, “the disagreeable”
with unwholesome states of mind associated with grief (displeasure),
and “the agreeable and disagreeable” with states of mind
associated with equanimous feeling.</P>

MA: This equanimity is the equanimity of insight (vipassan’upekkha).
The bhikkhu does not allow his mind to be overcome by lust, hate, or
delusion, but comprehends the object and sets up insight in the
neutral state. MT explains this to mean that he enters into
equanimity regarding formations (sankhar’upekkha), a particular
stage of insight knowledge (see Vsm XXI, 61-66).</P>

Since the arahant has eradicated all the defilements along with
their underlying tendencies, in this passage the three terms - the
agreeable, etc. - must be understood simply as the feelings that
arise through contact with sense objects, and not as the subtle
traces of liking, aversion, and indifference relevant to the
preceding passage.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote1360">
<P  ><A  NAME="sdendnote1360sym" HREF="#sdendnote1360anc">mccclx</A>
The Patisambhidamagga calls this practice “the noble supernormal
power” (ariya iddhi) and explains it thus (ii.212): To abide
perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive, one pervades a
repulsive being with lovingkindness, or one attends to a repulsive
object (either animate or inanimate) as a mere assemblage of
impersonal elements. To abide perceiving the repulsive in the
unrepulsive, one pervades a (sensually) attractive person with the
idea of the foulness of the body, or one attends to an attractive
object (either animate or inanimate) as impermanent. The third and
fourth methods involve the application of the first and second
contemplations to both repulsive and unrepulsive objects, without
discrimination. The fifth method involves the avoidance of joy and
sorrow in response to the six sense objects, thus enabling one to
abide in equanimity, mindful and fully aware.</P>
<P >Although this fivefold contemplation is
ascribed to the arahant as a power perfectly under his control,
elsewhere the Buddha teaches it to bhikkhus still in training as a
way to overcome the three unwholesome roots. See AN
5:144/iii.169-70; and for a thoughtful commentary on that sutta, see
Nyanaponika Thera, The Roots of Good and Evil, pp. 73-78.</P>
