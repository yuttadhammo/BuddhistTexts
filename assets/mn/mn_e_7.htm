7. Vatthupama Sutta - The Simile of the Cloth</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote84anc" HREF="#sdendnote84sym"><SUP>lxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's
Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
"Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One
said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, suppose a cloth were defiled and stained, and a dyer
dipped it in some dye or other, whether blue or yellow or red or
pink; it would look poorly dyed and impure in colour. Why is that?
Because of the impurity of the cloth. So too, when the mind is
defiled, an unhappy destination may be expected.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote85anc" HREF="#sdendnote85sym"><SUP>lxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Bhikkhus, suppose a cloth were pure and bright, and a dyer dipped it
in some dye or other, whether blue or yellow or red or pink; it would
look well-dyed and pure in colour. Why is that? Because of the purity
of the cloth. So too, when the mind is undefiled, a happy destination
may be expected.</P>
<P  >3.
"What, bhikkhus, are the imperfections that defile the mind?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote86anc" HREF="#sdendnote86sym"><SUP>lxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection that defiles
the mind.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote87anc" HREF="#sdendnote87sym"><SUP>lxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Ill will … anger … revenge … contempt … a domineering
attitude … envy … avarice … deceit … fraud … obstinacy …
presumption … conceit … arrogance … vanity … [37] …
negligence is an imperfection that defiles the mind.</P>
<P  >4.
"Knowing that covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection
that defiles the mind, a bhikkhu abandons it.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote88anc" HREF="#sdendnote88sym"><SUP>lxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Knowing that ill will … negligence is an imperfection that defiles
the mind, a bhikkhu abandons it.</P>
<P  >5.
"When a bhikkhu has known that covetousness and unrighteous greed
is an imperfection that defiles the mind and has abandoned it; when a
bhikkhu has known that ill will … negligence is an imperfection
that defiles the mind and has abandoned it, he acquires perfect
confidence in the Buddha thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote89anc" HREF="#sdendnote89sym"><SUP>lxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
'The Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in
true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable
leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans,
enlightened, blessed.'</P>
<P  >6.
"He acquires perfect confidence in the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma
is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, visible here and now,
immediately effective, inviting inspection, onward leading, to be
experienced by the wise for themselves.'</P>
<P  >7.
"He acquires perfect confidence in the Sangha thus: 'The Sangha
of the Blessed One's disciples is practising the good way,
practising the straight way, practising the true way, practising the
proper way, that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of
individuals; this Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy
of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of
reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the
world.'</P>
<P  >8.
"When he has given up, expelled, released, abandoned, and
relinquished [the imperfections of the mind] in part,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote90anc" HREF="#sdendnote90sym"><SUP>xc</SUP></A></SUP>
he considers thus: 'I am possessed of perfect confidence in the
Buddha,' and he gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration
in the Dhamma,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote91anc" HREF="#sdendnote91sym"><SUP>xci</SUP></A></SUP>
gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. When he is glad, rapture is
born in him; in one who is rapturous, the body becomes tranquil; one
whose body is tranquil feels pleasure; in one who feels pleasure, the
mind becomes concentrated.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote92anc" HREF="#sdendnote92sym"><SUP>xcii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9.
"He considers thus: 'I am possessed of perfect confidence in the
Dhamma,' and he gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration
in the Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. When he is
glad … the mind becomes concentrated. [38]</P>
<P  >10.
"He considers thus: 'I am possessed of perfect confidence in the
Sangha,' and he gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration
in the Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. When he is
glad … the mind becomes concentrated.</P>
<P  >11.
"He considers thus: '[The imperfections of the mind] have in part
been given up, expelled, released, abandoned, and relinquished by
me,' and he gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in
the Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. When he is
glad, rapture is born in him; in one who is rapturous, the body
becomes tranquil; one whose body is tranquil feels pleasure; in one
who feels pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.</P>
<P  >12.
"Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu of such virtue, such a state [of
concentration], and such wisdom<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote93anc" HREF="#sdendnote93sym"><SUP>xciii</SUP></A></SUP>
eats almsfood consisting of choice hill rice along with various
sauces and curries, even that will be no obstacle for him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote94anc" HREF="#sdendnote94sym"><SUP>xciv</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as a cloth that is defiled and stained becomes pure and bright
with the help of clear water, or just as gold becomes pure and bright
with the help of a furnace, so too, if a bhikkhu of such virtue …
eats almsfood … that will be no obstacle for him.</P>
<P  >13.
"He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote95anc" HREF="#sdendnote95sym"><SUP>xcv</SUP></A></SUP>
likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so
above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he
abides pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility
and without ill will.</P>
<P  >14-16.
"He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion
… with a mind imbued with appreciative joy … with a mind imbued
with equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise
the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to
himself, he abides pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind
imbued with equanimity, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility and without ill will.</P>
<P  >17.
"He understands thus: 'There is this, there is the inferior,
there is the superior, and beyond there is an escape from this whole
field of perception.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote96anc" HREF="#sdendnote96sym"><SUP>xcvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >18.
"When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'It is
liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.' [39] Bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is
called one bathed with the inner bathing."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote97anc" HREF="#sdendnote97sym"><SUP>xcvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >19.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja was sitting not
far from the Blessed One. Then he said to the Blessed One: "But
does Master Gotama go to the Bahuka River to bathe?"</P>
<P  >"Why,
brahmin, go to the Bahuka River? What can the Bahuka River do?"</P>
<P  >"Master
Gotama, the Bahuka River is held by many to give liberation, it is
held by many to give merit, and many wash away their evil actions in
the Bahuka River."</P>
<P  >20.
Then the Blessed One addressed the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja in
stanzas:</P>
<P >
"Bahuka and Adhikakka,</P>
<P >
Gaya and Sundarika too,</P>
<P >
Payaga and Sarassati,</P>
<P >
And the stream Bahumati - <SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote98anc" HREF="#sdendnote98sym"><SUP>xcviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
A fool may there forever bathe</P>
<P >
Yet will not purify dark deeds.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
What can the Sundarika bring to pass?</P>
<P >
What the Payaga? What the Bahuka?</P>
<P >
They cannot purify an evil-doer,</P>
<P >
A man who has done cruel and brutal deeds.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
One pure in heart has evermore</P>
<P >
The Feast of Spring, the Holy Day;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote99anc" HREF="#sdendnote99sym"><SUP>xcix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
One fair in act, one pure in heart</P>
<P >
Brings his virtue to perfection.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
It is here, brahmin, that you should bathe,</P>
<P >
To make yourself a refuge for all beings.</P>
<P >
And if you speak no falsehood</P>
<P >
Nor work harm for living beings,</P>
<P >
Nor take what is offered not,</P>
<P >
With faith and free from avarice,</P>
<P >
What need for you to go to Gaya?</P>
<P >
For any well will be your Gaya."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >21.
When this was said, the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja said:
"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would
receive the going forth under Master Gotama, I would receive the full
admission."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote100anc" HREF="#sdendnote100sym"><SUP>c</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >22.
And the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja received the going forth under
the Blessed One, and he received the full admission. [40] And soon,
not long after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn,
diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Bharadvaja, by
realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered
upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of
which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness.
He directly knew: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being." And the venerable Bharadvaja became one of the
arahants.</P>
