76. Sandaka Sutta - To Sandaka</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Kosambi in Ghosita's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the wanderer Sandaka was staying in the
Pilakkha-tree Cave with a large assembly of wanderers.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Ananda rose from meditation
and addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Come, friends, let us go to the
Devakata Pool to see the cave." - "Yes, friend," those bhikkhus
replied. Then the venerable Ananda went to the Devakata Pool together
with a number of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >4.
Now on that occasion the wanderer Sandaka was seated with a large
assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar, loudly and noisily
talking many kinds of pointless talk,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote748anc" HREF="#sdendnote748sym"><SUP>dccxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
such as talk of kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, battles,
food, drink, clothing, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, vehicles,
villages, towns, cities, countries, women, heroes, streets, wells,
the dead, trifles, the origin of the world, the origin of the sea,
[514] whether things are so or are not so. Then the wanderer Sandaka
saw the venerable Ananda coming in the distance. Seeing him, he
quieted his own assembly thus: "Sirs, be quiet; sirs, make no
noise. Here comes the recluse Ananda, a disciple of the recluse
Gotama, one of the recluse Gotama's disciples staying in Kosambi.
These venerable ones like quiet; they are disciplined in quiet; they
commend quiet. Perhaps if he finds our assembly a quiet one, he will
think to join us." Then the wanderers became silent.</P>
<P  >5.
The venerable Ananda went to the wanderer Sandaka who said to him:
"Let Master Ananda come! Welcome to Master Ananda! It is long since
Master Ananda found an opportunity to come here. Let Master Ananda be
seated; this seat is ready."</P>
<P  >The
venerable Ananda sat down on the seat made ready, and the wanderer
Sandaka took a low seat and sat down at one side. When he had done
so, the venerable Ananda asked him: "For what discussion are you
sitting together here now, Sandaka? And what was your discussion that
was left unfinished?"</P>
<P  >"Master
Ananda, let be the discussion for which we are now sitting together
here. Master Ananda can well hear about it later. It would be good if
Master Ananda would give a talk on his own teacher's Dhamma."</P>
<P  >"Then,
Sandaka, listen and attend closely to what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," he replied. The venerable Ananda said this:</P>
<P  >6.
"Sandaka, these four ways that negate the living of the holy life
have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened, and also these four kinds of holy
life without consolation have been declared, wherein a wise man
certainly would not live the holy life, or if he should live it,
would not attain the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote749anc" HREF="#sdendnote749sym"><SUP>dccxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"But,
Master Ananda, what are those four ways that negate the living of the
holy life that have been declared by the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, wherein [515] a wise man
certainly would not live the holy life, or if he should live it,
would not attain the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome?"</P>
<P  >7.
"Here, Sandaka, some teacher holds such a doctrine and view as
this: 'There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed;
no fruit or result of good and bad actions; no this world, no other
world; no mother, no father; no beings who are reborn spontaneously;
no good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have
themselves realised by direct knowledge and declare this world and
the other world. A person consists of the four great elements.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote750anc" HREF="#sdendnote750sym"><SUP>dccl</SUP></A></SUP>
When he dies, earth returns and goes back to the body of earth, water
returns and goes back to the body of water, fire returns and goes
back to the body of fire, air returns and goes back to the body of
air; the faculties are transferred to space. [Four] men with the bier
as fifth carry away the corpse. The funeral orations last as far as
the charnel ground; the bones whiten; burnt offerings end with ashes.
Giving is a doctrine of fools. When anyone asserts the doctrine that
there is [giving and the like], it is empty, false prattle. Fools and
the wise are alike cut off and annihilated with the dissolution of
the body; after death they do not exist.'</P>
<P  >8.
"About this a wise man considers thus: 'This good teacher holds
this doctrine and view: "There is nothing given … after death
they do not exist." If this good teacher's words are true, then
here [in this teaching] I have done [my duty] by not doing [it], here
I have lived [the holy life] by not living [it].<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote751anc" HREF="#sdendnote751sym"><SUP>dccli</SUP></A></SUP>
Both of us are exactly equal here [in this teaching], both have
arrived at equality, yet I do not say that both of us are cut off and
annihilated with the dissolution of the body, that after death we
shall not exist. But it is superfluous for this good teacher to go
about naked, to be shaven, to exert himself in the squatting posture,
and to pull out his hair and beard, since I, who live in a house
crowded with children, who use Benares sandalwood, who wear garlands,
scents, and unguents, and accept gold and silver, shall reap exactly
the same destination, the same future course, as this good teacher.
What do I know and see that I should lead the holy life under this
teacher?' So when he finds that this way negates the living of the
holy life, he turns away from it and leaves it.</P>
<P  >9.
"This is the first way that negates the living of the holy life
that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened, wherein a wise man certainly
would not live the holy life, [516] or if he should live it, would
not attain the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome.</P>
<P  >10.
"Again, Sandaka, here some teacher holds such a doctrine and view
as this: 'When one acts or makes others act, when one mutilates or
makes others mutilate, when one tortures or makes others inflict
torture, when one inflicts sorrow or makes others inflict sorrow,
when one oppresses or makes others inflict oppression, when one
intimidates or makes others inflict intimidation, when one kills
living beings, takes what is not given, breaks into houses, plunders
wealth, commits burglary, ambushes highways, seduces another's
wife, utters falsehood - no evil is done by the doer. If, with a
razor-rimmed wheel, one were to make the living beings on this earth
into one mass of flesh, into one heap of flesh, because of this there
would be no evil and no outcome of evil. If one were to go along the
south bank of the Ganges killing and slaughtering, mutilating and
making others mutilate, torturing and making others inflict torture,
because of this there would be no evil and no outcome of evil. If one
were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving gifts and making
others give gifts, making offerings and making others make offerings,
because of this there would be no merit and no outcome of merit. By
giving, by taming one self, by restraint, by speaking truth, there is
no merit and no outcome of merit.'</P>
<P  >11.
"About this a wise man considers thus: 'This good teacher holds
this doctrine and view: "When one acts … there is no merit and no
outcome of merit." If this good teacher's words are true, then
here [in this teaching] I have done [my duty] by not doing [it], here
I have lived [the holy life] by not living [it]. Both of us are
exactly equal here [in this teaching], both have arrived at equality,
yet I do not say that whatever both [of us] do, no evil is done. But
it is superfluous for this good teacher … What do I know and see

finds that this way negates the living of the holy life, he turns
away from it and leaves it.</P>
<P  >12.
"This is the second way that negates the living of the holy life
that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened …</P>
<P  >13.
"Again, Sandaka, here some teacher holds such a doctrine and view
as this: 'There is no cause or condition for the defilement of
beings; beings are defiled without cause or condition. There is no
cause or condition for the purification of beings; beings are
purified without cause or condition. There is no power, no energy, no
manly [517] strength, no manly endurance. All beings, all living
things, all creatures, all souls are without mastery, power, and
energy; moulded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience
pleasure and pain in the six classes.'</P>
<P  >14.
"About this a wise man considers thus: 'This good teacher holds
this doctrine and view: "There is no cause … in the six classes."
If this good teacher's words are true, then here [in this teaching]
I have done [my duty] by not doing [it], here I have lived [the holy
life] by not living [it]. Both of us are exactly equal here [in this
teaching], both have arrived at equality, yet I do not say that both
[of us] will be purified without cause or condition. But it is

that this way negates the living of the holy life, he turns away from
it and leaves it.</P>

"This is the third way that negates the living of the holy life

'There are these seven bodies that are unmade, not brought forth,
uncreated, without a creator, barren, standing like mountain peaks,
standing like pillars. They do not move or change or obstruct each
other. None is able [to arouse] pleasure or pain or pleasure-and-pain
in another. What are the seven? They are the earth-body, the
water-body, the fire-body, the air-body, pleasure, pain, and the soul
as the seventh. These seven bodies are unmade … Herein, there is no
killer, no slaughterer, no hearer, no speaker, no cognizer, no
intimater. Even those who cut off someone's head with a sharp sword
do not deprive anyone of life; the sword merely passes through the
space between the seven bodies. There are these fourteen hundred
thousand principal kinds of generation, and sixty hundred kinds, and
six hundred kinds; there are five hundred kinds of action, and five
kinds of action, and three kinds of action, and action and
half-action; there are sixty-two ways, sixty-two subaeons, six
classes, eight planes of man, forty-nine hundred kinds of livelihood,
forty-nine kinds of wanderers, forty-nine hundred [518] abodes of
serpents, twenty hundred faculties, thirty hundred hells, thirty-six
elements of dust, seven percipient breeds, seven non-percipient
breeds, seven sheathless breeds, seven kinds of gods, seven kinds of
men, seven kinds of demons, seven lakes, seven knots, seven kinds of
chasms, seven hundred kinds of chasms, seven kinds of dreams, seven
hundred kinds of dreams; and there are eighty-four hundred thousand
great aeons wherein, by running and wandering through the round of
rebirths, fools and the wise both will make an end of suffering.
There is none of this: "By this virtue or observance or asceticism
or holy life I shall make unripened action ripen or annihilate
ripened action as it comes." Pleasure and pain are meted out. The
round of rebirths is limited, there is no shortening or extending it,
no increasing or decreasing it. Just as a ball of string when thrown
goes as far as the string unwinds, so too, by</P>
<P  >running
and wandering through the round of rebirths, fools and the wise both
will make an end of suffering.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote753anc" HREF="#sdendnote753sym"><SUP>dccliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

"This is the fourth way that negates the living of the holy life
that has been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened …</P>

"Here, Sandaka, some teacher claims to be omniscient and
all-seeing, to have complete knowledge and vision thus:</P>
<P  >'Whether
I am walking or standing or sleeping or awake, knowledge and vision
are continuously and uninterruptedly present to me.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote754anc" HREF="#sdendnote754sym"><SUP>dccliv</SUP></A></SUP>
He enters an empty house, he gets no alms food, a dog bites him, he
meets with a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild bull, he asks the
name and clan of a woman or a man, he asks the name of a village or a
town, and the way to go there. When he is questioned: 'How is
this?' he replies: 'I had to enter an empty house, that is why I
entered it. I had to get no almsfood, that is why I did not get any.
I had to be bitten by a dog, that is why I was bitten. I had to meet
with a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild bull, that is why I met
with them. I had to ask the name and clan of a woman or a man, that

"About this a wise man considers thus: 'This good teacher claims
to be omniscient and all-seeing, to have complete knowledge and

had to … that is why I asked.'"So when he finds that this holy
life is without consolation, he turns away from it and leaves it.</P>

way, the Dhamma that is wholesome.</P>
<P  >24.
"Again, Sandaka, here some teacher is a traditionalist, one who
regards oral tradition as truth; he teaches a Dhamma by oral
tradition, by legends handed down, by what has come down in
scriptures. But when a teacher is a traditionalist, one who regards
oral tradition as truth, some is well remembered and some is wrongly
remembered, some is true and some is otherwise.</P>

"This is the second kind of holy life without consolation that has
been declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and
fully enlightened …</P>
<P  >27.
"Again, Sandaka, here a certain teacher is a reasoner, an inquirer.
He teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, following a line of
inquiry as it occurs to him. But when a teacher is a reasoner, an
inquirer, some is well reasoned and some is wrongly reasoned, some is

"Again, Sandaka, here a certain teacher is dull and confused.
Because he is dull and confused, [521] when he is asked such and such
a question, he engages in verbal wriggling, in eelwriggling: 'I
don't say it is like this. And I don't say it is like that. And I

"It is wonderful, Master Ananda, it is marvellous, how the four

But, Master Ananda, what does that teacher assert, what does he
declare, wherein a wise man certainly would live the holy life, and
while living it would attain the true way, the Dhamma that is
wholesome?'"</P>
<P  >35-42.
"Here, Sandaka, a Tathagata appears in the world, accomplished,
fully enlightened … (as Sutta 51, §§12-19) … he purifies his
mind from doubt.</P>
<P  >43.
"Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. A wise man certainly
would live the holy life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains
such a lofty distinction, [522] and while living it he would attain
the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome.</P>
<P  >44-46.
"Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he
enters upon and abides in the second jhana … With the fading away
as well of rapture … he enters upon and abides in the third jhana …
With the abandoning of pleasure and pain … he enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana. A wise man certainly would live the holy
life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains such a lofty
distinction …</P>
<P  >47.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one
birth, two births … (as Sutta 51, §24) … Thus with their aspects
and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. A wise man
certainly would live the holy life with a teacher under whom a
disciple attains such a lofty distinction …</P>
<P  >48.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 51, §25) … Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions. A wise man certainly would live the holy
life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains such a lofty
distinction …</P>
<P  >49.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. He understands as it actually is: 'This is suffering'
… (as Sutta 51, §26) … He understands as it actually is: 'This
is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.'</P>
<P  >50.
"When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'It is
liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.' A wise man certainly would live the
holy life with a teacher under whom a disciple attains such a lofty
distinction, and while living it he would attain the true way, the
Dhamma that is wholesome."</P>

"But, Master Ananda, when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints
destroyed, one who has lived the holy life, done what had to be done,
laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of
being, and is completely liberated through final knowledge, [523]
could he enjoy sensual pleasures?"</P>
<P  >"Sandaka,
when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed … and is
completely liberated through final knowledge, he is incapable of
transgression in five cases. A bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is
incapable of deliberately depriving a living being of life; he is
incapable of taking what is not given, that is, of stealing; he is
incapable of indulging in sexual intercourse; he is incapable of
knowingly speaking falsehood; he is incapable of enjoying sensual
pleasures by storing them up as he did formerly in lay life.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote756anc" HREF="#sdendnote756sym"><SUP>dcclvi</SUP></A></SUP>

"But, Master Ananda, when a bhikkhu is an arahant with taints
destroyed … is his knowledge and vision that his taints are
destroyed continuously and uninterruptedly present to him whether he
is walking or standing or sleeping or awake?"</P>
<P  >"As
to that, Sandaka, I shall give you a simile, for some wise men here
understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile. Suppose a
man's hands and feet were cut off. Would he know 'My hands and
feet are cut off' continuously and uninterruptedly, whether he is
walking or standing or sleeping or awake, or would he know 'My
hands and feet are cut off' only when he reviews this fact?"</P>

continuously and uninterruptedly; rather, he would know 'My hands

<P  >"There
are not only one hundred, Sandaka, or two hundred, three hundred,
four hundred or five hundred, but far more emancipated ones than that

<P  >"It
is wonderful, Master Ananda, it is marvellous! There is no lauding of
one's own Dhamma and no disparaging of the Dhamma of others; there
is the teaching of the Dhamma in its full range, [524] and so many

Then the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own assembly: "Go, sirs.
The holy life is to be lived under the recluse Gotama. It is not easy
