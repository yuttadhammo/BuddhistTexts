19. Dvedhavitakka Sutta - Two Kinds of Thought</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an
unenlightened Bodhisatta, it occurred to me: 'Suppose that I divide
my thoughts into two classes.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote235anc" HREF="#sdendnote235sym"><SUP>ccxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Then I set on one side thoughts of sensual desire, thoughts of ill
will, and thoughts of cruelty, and I set on the other side thoughts
of renunciation, thoughts of non-ill will, and thoughts of
non-cruelty.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote236anc" HREF="#sdendnote236sym"><SUP>ccxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
"As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, [115] a thought
of sensual desire arose in me. I understood thus: 'This thought of
sensual desire has arisen in me. This leads to my own affliction, to
others' affliction, and to the affliction of both; it obstructs
wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from Nibbana.' When I
considered: 'This leads to my own affliction,' it subsided in me;
when I considered: 'This leads to others' affliction,' it
subsided in me; when I considered: 'This leads to the affliction of
both,' it subsided in me; when I considered: 'This obstructs
wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from Nibbana,' it
subsided in me. Whenever a thought of sensual desire arose in me, I
abandoned it, removed it, did away with it.</P>
<P  >4-5.
"As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of ill
will arose in me … a thought of cruelty arose in me. I understood
thus: 'This thought of cruelty has arisen in me. This leads to my
own affliction, to others' affliction, and to the affliction of
both; it obstructs wisdom, causes difficulties, and leads away from
Nibbana.' When I considered thus … it subsided in me. Whenever a
thought of cruelty arose in me, I abandoned it, removed it, did away
with it.</P>
<P  >6.
"Bhikkhus, whatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon,
that will become the inclination of his mind. If he frequently thinks
and ponders upon thoughts of sensual desire, he has abandoned the
thought of renunciation to cultivate the thought of sensual desire,
and then his mind inclines to thoughts of sensual desire. If he
frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of ill will … upon
thoughts of cruelty, he has abandoned the thought of non-cruelty to
cultivate the thought of cruelty, and then his mind inclines to
thoughts of cruelty.</P>
<P  >7.
"Just as in the last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, when
the crops thicken, a cowherd would guard his cows by constantly
tapping and poking them on this side and that with a stick to check
and curb them. Why is that? Because he sees that he could be flogged,
imprisoned, fined, or blamed [if he let them stray into the crops].
So too I saw in unwholesome states danger, degradation, and
defilement, and in wholesome states the blessing of renunciation, the
aspect of cleansing. [116]</P>
<P  >8.
"As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of
renunciation arose in me. I understood thus: 'This thought of
renunciation has arisen in me. This does not lead to my own
affliction, or to others' affliction, or to the affliction of both;
it aids wisdom, does not cause difficulties, and leads to Nibbana. If
I think and ponder upon this thought even for a night, even for a
day, even for a night and day, I see nothing to fear from it. But
with excessive thinking and pondering I might tire my body, and when
the body is tired, the mind becomes disturbed, and when the mind is
disturbed, it is far from concentration.' So I steadied my mind
internally, quieted it, brought it to singleness, and concentrated
it. Why is that? So that my mind should not be disturbed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote237anc" HREF="#sdendnote237sym"><SUP>ccxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9-10.
"As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of
non-ill will arose in me … a thought of non-cruelty arose in me. I
understood thus: 'This thought of non-cruelty has arisen in me.
This does not lead to my own affliction, or to others' affliction,
or to the affliction of both; it aids wisdom, does not cause
difficulties, and leads to Nibbana. If I think and ponder upon this
thought even for a night, even for a day, even for a night and day, I
see nothing to fear from it. But with excessive thinking and
pondering I might tire my body, and when the body is tired, the mind
becomes disturbed, and when the mind</P>
<P  >is
disturbed, it is far from concentration.' So I steadied my mind
internally, quieted it, brought it to singleness, and concentrated
it. Why is that? So that my mind should not be disturbed.</P>
<P  >11.
"Bhikkhus, whatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon,
that will become the inclination of his mind. If he frequently thinks
and ponders upon thoughts of renunciation, he has abandoned the
thought of sensual desire to cultivate the thought of renunciation,
and then his mind inclines to thoughts of renunciation. If he
frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of non-ill will … upon
thoughts of non-cruelty, he has abandoned the thought of cruelty to
cultivate the thought of noncruelty, and then his mind inclines to
thoughts of non-cruelty.</P>
<P  >12.
"Just as in the last month of the hot season, when all the crops
have been brought inside the villages, [117] a cowherd would guard
his cows while staying at the root of a tree or out in the open,
since he needs only to be mindful that the cows are there; so too,
there was need for me only to be mindful that those states were
there.</P>
<P  >13.
"Tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was
established, my body was tranquil and untroubled, my mind
concentrated and unified.</P>
<P  >14-23.
"Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, I entered upon and abided in the first jhana … (as Sutta 4,
§§23-32) … I directly knew: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.'</P>
<P  >24.
"This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the third
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute.</P>
<P  >25.
"Suppose, bhikkhus, that in a wooded range there was a great
low-lying marsh near which a large herd of deer lived. Then a man
appeared desiring their ruin, harm, and bondage, and he closed off
the safe and good path that led to their happiness, and he opened up
a false path, and he put out a decoy and set up a dummy so that the
large herd of deer might later come upon calamity, disaster, and
loss. But another man came desiring their good, welfare, and
protection, and he reopened the safe and good path that led to their
happiness, and he closed off the false path, and he removed the decoy
and destroyed the dummy, so that the large herd of deer might later
come to growth, increase, and fulfilment.</P>
<P  >26.
"Bhikkhus, I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning.
[118] This is the meaning: 'The great low-lying marsh' is a term
for sensual pleasures. 'The large herd of deer' is a term for
beings. 'The man desiring their ruin, harm, and bondage' is a
term for Mara the Evil One. 'The false path' is a term for the
wrong eightfold path, that is: wrong view, wrong intention, wrong
speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong
mindfulness, and wrong concentration. 'The decoy' is a term for
delight and lust. 'The dummy' is a term for ignorance. 'The man
desiring their good, welfare, and protection' is a term for the
Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened. 'The safe and good
path that led to their happiness' is a term for the Noble Eightfold
Path, that is: right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
concentration.</P>
<P  >"So,
bhikkhus, the safe and good path that leads to happiness has been
reopened by me, the wrong path has been closed off, the decoy
removed, the dummy destroyed.</P>
<P  >27.
"What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a
teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I
have done for you, bhikkhus. There are these roots of trees, these
empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not delay or else you will regret
it later. This is our instruction to you."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
