119. Kayagatasati Sutta - Mindfulness of the Body</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now a number of bhikkhus were sitting in the assembly hall, where
they had met together on returning from their almsround, after their
meal, when this discussion arose among them: “It is wonderful,
friends, it is marvellous, how it has been said by the Blessed One
who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, that
mindfulness of the body, when developed and cultivated, is of great
fruit and great benefit.”</P>
<P  >However,
their discussion was interrupted; for the Blessed One rose from
meditation when it was evening, went to the assembly hall, and sat
down on a seat made ready. Then he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
“Bhikkhus, for what discussion are you sitting together here now?
And what was your discussion that was interrupted?” [89]</P>
<P  >“Here,
venerable sir, we were sitting in the assembly hall, where we had met
together on returning from our almsround, after our meal, when this
discussion arose among us: ‘It is wonderful, friends, it is
marvellous, how it has been said by the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, that mindfulness of the
body, when developed and cultivated, is of great fruit and great
benefit.’ This was our discussion, venerable sir, that was
interrupted when the Blessed One arrived.”</P>
<P  >3.
“And how, bhikkhus, is mindfulness of the body developed and
cultivated so that it is of great fruit and great benefit?</P>
<H3 >(MINDFULNESS OF BREATHING)</H3>
<P  >4.
“Here a bhikkhu,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1129anc" HREF="#sdendnote1129sym"><SUP>mcxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits
down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and
established mindfulness in front of him, ever mindful he breathes in,
mindful he breathes out. Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I
breathe in long’; or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I
breathe out long.’ Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe
in short’; or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out
short.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the
whole body [of breath]’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out
experiencing the whole body [of breath].’ He trains thus: ‘I
shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation’; he trains
thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation.’
As he abides thus diligent, ardent, and resolute, his memories and
intentions based on the household life are abandoned; with their
abandoning his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to
singleness, and concentrated. That is how a bh.ikkhu develops
mindfulness of the body.</P>
<H3 >(THE FOUR POSTURES)</H3>
<P  >5.
“Again, bhikkhus, when walking, a bhikkhu understands: ‘I am
walking’; when standing, he understands: ‘I am standing’; when
sitting, he understands: ‘I am sitting’; when lying down, he
understands: ‘I am lying down’; or he understands accordingly
however his body is disposed. As he abides thus diligent, ardent, and
resolute, his memories and intentions based on the household life are
abandoned … That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the
body. [90]</P>
<H3 >(FULL AWARENESS)</H3>
<P  >6.
“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness when
going forward and returning; who acts in full awareness when looking
ahead and looking away; who acts in full awareness when flexing and
extending his limbs; who acts in full awareness when wearing his
robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts in full
awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who
acts in full awareness when defecating or urinating; who acts in full
awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up,
talking, and keeping silent. As he abides thus diligent, ardent, and
resolute, his memories and intentions based on the household life are
abandoned … That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the
body.</P>
<H3 >(FOULNESS - THE BODILY PARTS)</H3>
<P  >7.
“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the
soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair, bounded by skin,
as full of many kinds of impurity thus: ‘In this body there are
head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones,
bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, large
intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach, feces, bile,
phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of
the joints, and urine.’ Just as though there were a bag with an
opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain, such as hill rice,
red rice, beans, peas, millet, and white rice, and a man with good
eyes were to open it and review it thus: ‘This is hill rice, this
is red rice, these are beans, these are peas, this is millet, this is
white rice’; so too, a bhikkhu reviews this same body as full of
many kinds of impurity thus: ‘In this body there are head-hairs …
and urine.’ As he abides thus diligent, ardent, and resolute, his
memories and intentions based on the household life are abandoned …
That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body. [91]</P>
<H3 >(ELEMENTS)</H3>
<P  >8.
“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body, however it is
placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus: ‘In this
body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire
element, and the air element.’ Just as though a skilled butcher or
his apprentice had killed a cow and were seated at the crossroads
with it cut up into pieces; so too, a bhikkhu reviews this same body
however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements
thus: ‘In this body there are the earth element, the water element,
the fire element, and the air element.’ As he abides thus diligent,
ardent, and resolute, his memories and intentions connected with the
household life are abandoned … That too is how a bhikkhu develops
mindfulness of the body.</P>
<H3 >THE NINE CHARNEL GROUND CONTEMPLATIONS)</H3>
<P  >9.
“Again, bhikkhus, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in
a charnel ground, one, two, or three days dead, bloated, livid, and
oozing matter, a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus: ‘This
body too is of the same nature, it will be like that, it is not
exempt from that fate.’ As he abides thus diligent … That too is
how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body.</P>
<P  >10.
“Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel
ground, being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, or
various kinds of worms, a bhikkhu compares this same body with it
thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it will be like that,
it is not exempt from that fate.’ As he abides thus diligent …
That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body. [92]</P>
<P  >11-14.
“Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel
ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together with sinews …
a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, held together with sinews …
a skeleton without flesh and blood, held together with sinews …
disconnected bones scattered in all directions - here a hand-bone,
there a foot-bone, here a shinbone, there a thigh-bone, here a
hip-bone, there a back-bone, here a rib-bone, there a breast-bone,
here an arm-bone, there a shoulder-bone, here a neck-bone, there a
jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull - a bhikkhu compares this
same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of the same nature, it
will be like that, it is not exempt from that fate.’ As he abides
thus diligent … That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of
the body.</P>
<P  >15-17.
“Again, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in a charnel
ground, bones bleached white, the colour of shells … bones heaped
up, more than a year old … bones rotted and crumbled to dust, a
bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus: ‘This body too is of
the same nature, it will be like that, it is not exempt from that
fate.’ As he abides thus diligent … That too is how a bhikkhu
develops mindfulness of the body.</P>
<H3 >(THE JHANAS)</H3>
<P  >18.
“Again, bhikkhus, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</P>
<P  >He
makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench, steep, fill,
and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. Just as a
skilled bath man or a bath man’s apprentice<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1130anc" HREF="#sdendnote1130sym"><SUP>mcxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
heaps bath powder in a metal basin and, sprinkling it gradually with
water, kneads it till the moisture wets his ball of bath powder,
soaks it and pervades it inside and out, yet the ball itself does not
ooze; so too, a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion [93] drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that
there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion. As he abides thus diligent … That too
is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body.</P>
<P  >19.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which
has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.
He makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench,
steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his
whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of
concentration. Just as though there were a lake whose waters welled
up from below and it had no inflow from east, west, north, or south,
and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain,
then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the
cool water drench, steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that there
would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water; so too,
a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of
concentration. As he abides thus diligent … That too is how a
bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the body.</P>
<P  >20.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the fading away as well of rapture, a
bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still
feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the
third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a
pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’ He makes the
pleasure divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this
body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the
pleasure divested of rapture. Just as in a pond of blue or white or
red lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water thrive
immersed in the water without rising out of it, [94] and cool water
drenches, steeps, fills, and pervades them to their tips and their
roots, so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by
cool water; so too, a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapture. As
he abides thus diligent … That too is how a bhikkhu develops
mindfulness of the body.</P>
<P  >21.
“Again, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and
with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity. He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so
that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright
mind. Just as though a man were sitting covered from head down with a
white cloth, so that there would be no part of his whole body not
covered by the white cloth; so too, a bhikkhu sits pervading this
body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his body
unpervaded by the pure bright mind. As he abides thus diligent,
ardent, and resolute, his memories and intentions based on the
household life are abandoned; with their abandoning his mind becomes
steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated. That too is how a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of the
body.</P>
<H3 >(PROGRESS THROUGH MINDFULNESS OF THE BODY)</H3>
<P  >22.
“Bhikkhus, anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of
the body has included within himself whatever wholesome states there
are that partake of true knowledge.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1131anc" HREF="#sdendnote1131sym"><SUP>mcxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as anyone who has extended his mind over the great ocean has
included within it whatever streams there are that flow into the
ocean; so too, anyone who has developed and cultivated mindfulness of
the body has included within himself whatever wholesome states there
are that partake of true knowledge.</P>
<P  >23.
“Bhikkhus, when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness
of the body, Mara finds an opportunity and a support in him. Suppose
a man were to throw a heavy stone ball upon a mound of wet clay. What
do you think, bhikkhus? Would that heavy ball find entry into that
mound of wet clay?” - “Yes, venerable sir.” - [95] “So too,
bhikkhus, when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of
the body, Mara finds an opportunity and a support in him.</P>
<P  >24.
“Suppose there were a dry sapless piece of wood, and a man came
with an upper fire-stick, thinking: ‘I shall light a fire, I shall
produce heat.’ What do you think, bhikkhus? Could the man light a
fire and produce heat by rubbing the dry sapless piece of wood with
an upper fire-stick?” - “Yes, venerable sir.” - “So too,
bhikkhus, when anyone has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of
the body, Mara finds an opportunity and a support in him.</P>
<P  >25.
“Suppose there were a hollow empty water jug set out on a stand,
and a man came with a supply of water. What do you think, bhikkhus?
Could the man pour the water into the jug?” - “Yes, venerable
sir.” - “So too, bhikkhus, when anyone has not developed and
cultivated mindfulness of the body, Mara finds an opportunity and a
support in him.</P>
<P  >26.
“Bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of
the body, Mara cannot find an opportunity or a support in him.
Suppose a man were to throw a light ball of string at a door-panel
made entirely of heartwood. What do you think, bhikkhus? Would that
light ball of string find entry through that door-panel made entirely
of heartwood?” - “No, venerable sir.” - “So too, bhikkhus,
when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body,
Mara cannot find an opportunity or a support in him.</P>
<P  >27.
“Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood, and a man came with
an upper fire-stick, thinking: ‘I shall light a fire, I shall
produce heat.’ [96] What do you think, bhikkhus? Could the man
light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper firestick and
rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood?” - “No, venerable
sir.” - “So too, bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and
cultivated mindfulness of the body, Mara cannot find an opportunity
or a support in him.</P>
<P  >28.
“Suppose, set out on a stand, there were a water jug full of water
right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it, and a man
came with a supply of water. What do you think, bhikkhus? Could the
man pour the water into the jug?” - “No, venerable sir.” - “So
too, bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness
of the body, Mara cannot find an opportunity or a support in him.</P>
<P  >29.
“Bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of
the body, then when he inclines his mind towards realising any state
that may be realised by direct knowledge, he attains the ability to
witness any aspect therein, there being a suitable basis. Suppose,
set out on a stand, there were a water jug full of water right up to
the brim so that crows could drink from it. Whenever a strong man
tips it, would water come out?” - “Yes, venerable sir.” - “So
too, bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness
of the body, then when he inclines his mind towards realising any
state that may be realised by direct knowledge, he attains the
ability to witness any aspect therein, there being a suitable basis.</P>
<P  >30.
“Suppose there were a square pond on level ground, surrounded by an
embankment, full of water right up to the brim so that crows could
drink from it. Whenever a strong man loosens the embankment, would
water come out?” - [97] “Yes, venerable sir.” - “So too,
bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the
body … he attains the ability to witness any aspect therein, there
being a suitable basis.</P>
<P  >31.
“Suppose there were a chariot on even ground at the crossroads,
harnessed to thoroughbreds, waiting with goad lying ready, so that a
skilled trainer, a charioteer of horses to be tamed, might mount it,
and taking the reins in his left hand and the goad in his right hand,
might drive out and back by any road whenever he likes. So too,
bhikkhus, when anyone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the
body … he attains the ability to witness any aspect therein, there
being a suitable basis.</P>
<H3 >(BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS OF THE BODY)</H3>
<P  >32.
“Bhikkhus, when mindfulness of the body has been repeatedly
practised, developed, cultivated, used as a vehicle, used as a basis,
established, consolidated, and well undertaken, these ten benefits
may be expected. What ten?</P>
<P  >33.
(i) “One becomes a conqueror of discontent and delight, and
discontent does not conquer oneself; one abides overcoming discontent
whenever it arises.</P>
<P  >34.
(ii) “One becomes a conqueror of fear and dread, and fear and dread
do not conquer oneself; one abides overcoming fear and dread whenever
they arise.</P>
<P  >35.
(iii) “One bears cold and heat, hunger and thirst, and contact with
gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the sun, and creeping things; one endures
ill-spoken, unwelcome words and arisen bodily feelings that are
painful, racking, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, distressing, and
menacing to life.</P>
<P  >36.
(iv) “One obtains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four
jhanas that constitute the higher mind and [98] provide a pleasant
abiding here and now.</P>
<P  >37.
(v) “One wields the various kinds of supernormal power … (as
Sutta 108, §18) … one wields bodily mastery even as far as the
Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >38.
(vi) “With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses
the human, one hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human,
those that are far as well as near.</P>
<P  >39.
(vii) “One understands the minds of other beings, of other persons,
having encompassed them with one’s own mind. One understands a mind
affected by lust as affected by lust … (as Sutta 108, §20) … an
unliberated mind as unliberated.</P>
<P  >40.
(viii) “One recollects one’s manifold past lives, that is, [99]
one birth, two births … (as Sutta 51, §24) … Thus with their
aspects and particulars one recollects one’s manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >41.
(ix) “With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the
human, one sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and
superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and one
understands how beings pass on according to their actions.</P>
<P  >42.
(x) “By realising for oneself with direct knowledge, one here and
now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance
by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints.</P>
<P  >43.
“Bhikkhus, when mindfulness of the body has been repeatedly
practised, developed, cultivated, used as a vehicle, used as a basis,
established, consolidated, and well undertaken, these ten benefits
may be expected.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
