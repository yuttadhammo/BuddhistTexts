134. Lomasakangiyabhaddekaratta Sutta - Lomasakangiya and One
Fortunate Attachment</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Now on that
occasion the venerable Lomasakangiya was living in the Sakyan country
at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha's Park.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1221anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1221sym"><SUP>mccxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Then, when the night was well advanced, Candana, a young deity of
beautiful appearance who illuminated the whole of Nigrodha's Park,
approached the venerable Lomasakangiya. Standing at one side, Candana
the young deity said to him:</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
do you remember the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One
Fortunate Attachment'?" [200]</P>
<P  >"Friend,
I do not remember the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One
Fortunate Attachment.' But, friend, do you remember the summary and
exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment'?"</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
I too do not remember the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has
One Fortunate Attachment.' But, bhikkhu, do you remember the stanza
of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment'?"</P>
<P  >"Friend,
I do not remember the stanza of 'One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment.' But, friend, do you remember the stanza of 'One Who
Has One Fortunate Attachment'?"</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
I remember the stanza of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.'"</P>
<P  >"But,
friend, in what way do you remember the stanza of 'One Who Has One
Fortunate Attachment'?"</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
once the Blessed One was living among the gods of the heaven of the
Thirty-three, on the Red Marble Stone at the root of the
Paricchattaka tree.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1222anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1222sym"><SUP>mccxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
There the Blessed One recited the summary and exposition of 'One
Who Has One Fortunate Attachment' to the gods of the heaven of the
Thirty-three:</P>
<P  >3.
Let not a person revive the past</P>
<P >
Or on the future build his hopes;</P>
<P >
For the past has been left behind</P>
<P >
And the future has not been reached.</P>
<P >
Instead with insight let him see</P>
<P >
Each presently arisen state;</P>
<P >
Let him know that and be sure of it,</P>
<P >
Invincibly, unshakeably.</P>
<P >
Today the effort must be made;</P>
<P >
Tomorrow Death may come, who knows?</P>
<P >
No bargain with Mortality</P>
<P >
Can keep him and his hordes away.</P>
<P >
But one who dwells thus ardently,</P>
<P >
Relentlessly, by day, by night -</P>
<P >
It is he, the Peaceful Sage has said,</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment.'</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >4.
"Bhikkhu, I remember the stanza of 'One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment' thus. Bhikkhu, learn the summary and exposition of 'One
Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.' Bhikkhu, master the summary and
exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.' Bhikkhu,
remember the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment.' Bhikkhu, the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has
One Fortunate Attachment' is beneficial, it belongs to the
fundamentals of the holy life."</P>
<P  >That
is what was said by Candana the young deity, who thereupon vanished
at once.</P>
<P  >5.
Then, when the night was over, the venerable Lomasakangiya set his
resting place in order, and taking his bowl and outer robe, set out
to wander by stages to Savatthi. He [201] at length arrived at
Savatthi, and went to the Blessed One in Jeta's Grove,
Anathapindika's Park. After paying homage to him, he sat down at
one side, told the Blessed One all that had occurred, and said: "It
would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me the
summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.'"</P>
<P  >6.
"Bhikkhu, do you know that young deity?" "No, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
that young deity is named Candana. He heeds the Dhamma, gives it
attention, engages it with all his mind, hears it with eager ears.
So, bhikkhu, listen and attend closely to what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," the venerable Lomasakangiya replied to the Blessed
One. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >7-14.
"Let not a person revive the past ...</P>
<P >
(Repeat the whole of Sutta 131, §§3-10 up to:) [202]</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The Venerable Lomasakangiya was
satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
