113. Sappurisa Sutta - The True Man</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatth3 in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the character of a true man and the
character of an untrue man.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1064anc" HREF="#sdendnote1064sym"><SUP>mlxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes, venerable
sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
“Bhikkhus, what is the character of an untrue man? Here an untrue
man who has gone forth from an aristocratic family considers thus: ‘I
have gone forth from an aristocratic family; but these other bhikkhus
have not gone forth from aristocratic families.’ So he lauds
himself and disparages others because of his aristocratic family.
This is the character of an untrue man.</P>
<P  >“But
a true man considers thus: ‘It is not because of one’s
aristocratic family that states of greed, hatred, or delusion are
destroyed. Even though someone may not have gone forth from an
aristocratic family, yet if he has entered upon the way that accords
with the Dhamma, entered upon the proper way, [38] and conducts
himself according to the Dhamma, he should be honoured for that, he
should be praised for that.’ So, putting the practice of the way
first, he neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of his
aristocratic family. This is the character of a true man.</P>
<P  >4-6.
“Moreover, an untrue man who has gone forth from a great family …
from a wealthy family … from an influential family considers thus:
‘I have gone forth from an influential family; but these other
bhikkhus have not gone forth from influential families.’ So he
lauds himself and disparages others because of his influential
family. This too is the character of an untrue man.</P>
<P  >“But
a true man considers thus: ‘It is not because of one’s
influential family that states of greed, hatred, or delusion are
destroyed. Even though someone may not have gone forth from an
influential family, yet if he has entered upon the way that accords
with the Dhamma, entered upon the proper way, and conducts himself
according to the Dhamma, he should be honoured for that, he should be
praised for that.’ So, putting the practice of the way first, he
neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of his
influential family. This too is the character of a true man.</P>
<P  >7.
“Moreover, an untrue man who is well known and famous considers
thus: ‘I am well known and famous; but these other bhikkhus are
unknown and of no account.’ So he lauds himself and disparages
others because of his renown. This too is the character of an untrue
man.</P>
<P  >“But
a true man considers thus: ‘It is not because of one’s renown
that states of greed, hatred, or delusion are destroyed. Even though
someone may not be well known and famous, yet if he has entered upon
the way that accords with the Dhamma, entered upon the proper way,
and conducts himself according to the Dhamma, he should be honoured
for that, he should be praised for that.’ So, putting the practice
of the way first, he neither lauds himself nor disparages others
because of his renown. This too is the character of a true man. [39]</P>
<P  >8.
“Moreover, an untrue man who gains robes, almsfood, resting places,
and requisites of medicine considers thus: ‘I gain robes, almsfood,
resting places, and requisites of medicine; but these other bhikkhus
do not gain these things.’ So he lauds himself and disparages
others because of gain. This too is the character of an untrue man.</P>
<P  >“But
a true man considers thus: ‘It is not because of gain that states
of greed, hatred, or delusion are destroyed. Even though someone has
no gain, yet if he has entered upon the way that accords with the
Dhamma, entered upon the proper way, and conducts himself according
to the Dhamma, he should be honoured for that, he should be praised
for that.’ So, putting the practice of the way first, he neither
lauds himself nor disparages others because of gain. This too is the
character of a true man.</P>
<P  >9-20.
“Moreover, an untrue man who is learned … who is expert in the
Discipline … [40] … who is a preacher of the Dhamma … who is a
forest dweller … who is a refuse-rag wearer … [41] … an
almsfood eater … a tree-root dweller … [42] … a charnel-ground
dweller … an open-air dweller … a continual sitter … an any-bed
user … a one-session eater considers thus: ‘I am a one-session
eater; but these other bhikkhus are not one-session eaters.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1065anc" HREF="#sdendnote1065sym"><SUP>mlxv</SUP></A></SUP>
So he lauds himself and disparages others because of his being a
one-session eater. This too is the character of an untrue man.</P>
<P  >“But
an untrue man considers thus: ‘It is not because of being a
one-session eater that states of greed, hatred, or delusion are
destroyed. Even though someone may not be a onesession eater, yet if
he has entered upon the way that accords with the Dhamma, entered
upon the proper way, and conducts himself according to the Dhamma, he
should be honoured for that, he should be praised for that.’ So,
putting the practice of the way first, he neither lauds himself nor
disparages others because of his being a one-session eater. This too
is the character of a true man.</P>
<P  >21.
“Moreover, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, an untrue man enters upon and abides in the first
jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He considers thus: ‘I have
gained the attainment of the first jhana; but these other bhikkhus
have not gained the attainment of the first jhana.’ So he lauds
himself and disparages others because of his attainment of the first
jhana. This too is the character of an untrue man.</P>
<P  >“But
a true man considers thus: ‘Non-identification even with the
attainment of the first jhana has been declared by the Blessed One;
for in whatever way they conceive, the fact is ever other than
that.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1066anc" HREF="#sdendnote1066sym"><SUP>mlxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
[43] So, putting non-identification first, he neither lauds himself
nor disparages others because of his attainment of the first jhana.
This too is the character of a true man.</P>
<P  >22-24.
“Moreover, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, an
untrue man enters upon and abides in the second jhana … With the
fading away as well of rapture … he enters upon and abides in the
third jhana … With the abandoning of pleasure and pain … he
enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana …</P>
<P  >25.
“Moreover, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form,
with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware</P>
<P  >that
‘space is infinite,’ an untrue man enters upon and abides in the
base of infinite space …</P>
<P  >26.
“Moreover, by completely surmounting the base of infinite space,
aware that ‘consciousness is infinite,’ an untrue man enters upon
and abides in the base of infinite consciousness … [44] …</P>
<P  >27.
“Moreover, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ an untrue man
enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness …</P>
<P  >28.
“Moreover, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, an
untrue man enters upon and abides in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He considers thus: ‘I have
gained the attainment of the base of
neither-perceptionnor-non-perception; but these other bhikkhus have
not gained the attainment of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.’ So he lauds himself and
disparages others because of his attainment of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This too is the character of
an untrue man.</P>
<P  >“But
a true man considers thus: ‘Non-identification even with the
attainment of the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception has
been declared by the Blessed One; for in whatever way they conceive,
the fact is ever other than that.’ So, putting non-identification
first, he neither lauds himself nor disparages others because of his
attainment of the base of neitherperception-nor-non-perception. This
too is the character of a true man. [45]</P>
<P  >29.
“Moreover, by completely surmounting the base of
neitherperception-nor-non-perception, a true man enters upon and
abides in the cessation of perception and feeling.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1067anc" HREF="#sdendnote1067sym"><SUP>mlxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
And his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom. This bhikkhu
does not conceive anything, he does not conceive in regard to
anything, he does not conceive in any way.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1068anc" HREF="#sdendnote1068sym"><SUP>mlxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
