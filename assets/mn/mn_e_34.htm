34. Culagopalaka Sutta - The Shorter Discourse on the Cowherd</H2>
<P  >[225]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Vajjian country at Ukkacela on the banks of the river Ganges.
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable
sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, there was once a foolish Magadhan cowherd who, in the
last month of the rainy season, in the autumn, without examining the
near shore or the further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle
across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had
no ford. Then the cattle bunched together in mid-stream in the river
Ganges, and they met with calamity and disaster. Why was that?
Because that foolish Magadhan cowherd, in the last month of the rainy
season, in the autumn, without examining the near shore or the
further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle across to the
other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had no ford.</P>
<P  >3.
“So too, bhikkhus, as to those recluses and brahmins who are
unskilled in this world and the other world, unskilled in Mara’s
realm and what is outside Mara’s realm, unskilled in the realm of
Death and what is outside the realm of Death - it will lead to the
harm and suffering for a long time of those who think they should
listen to them and place faith in them.</P>
<P  >4.
“Bhikkhus, there was once a wise Magadhan cowherd who, in the last
month of the rainy season, in the autumn, after examining the near
shore and the further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle
across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had
a ford. He made the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd, enter
first, and they breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely
across to the further shore. He made the strong cattle and the cattle
to be tamed enter next, and they</P>
<P  >too
breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the
further shore. He made the heifers and young oxen enter next, and
they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to
the further shore. He made the calves and the feeble cattle enter
next, and they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely
across to the further shore. At the time there was a tender calf just
born, and being urged on by its mother’s lowing, it too breasted
the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore.
Why was that? Because that wise Magadhan cowherd, [226] in the last
month of the rainy season, in the autumn, after examining the near
shore and the further shore of the river Ganges, drove his cattle
across to the other shore in the Videhan country at a place that had
a ford.</P>
<P  >5.
“So too, bhikkhus, as to those recluses and brahmins who are
skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in Mara’s realm
and what is outside Mara’s realm, skilled in the realm of Death and
what is outside the realm of Death - it willl lead to the welfare and
happiness for a long time of those who think they should listen to
them and place faith in them.</P>
<P  >6.
“Bhikkhus, just as the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd,
breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the
further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints
destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done,
laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of
being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge - by
breasting Mara’s stream they have gotten safely across to the
further shore.</P>
<P  >7.
“Just as the strong cattle and the cattle to be tamed breasted the
stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so
too, those bhikkhus who, with the destruction of the five lower
fetters, will reappear spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there
attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that world - by
breasting Mara’s stream they will get safely across to the further
shore.</P>
<P  >8.
“Just as the heifers and young oxen breasted the stream of the
Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those
bhikkhus who, with the destruction of three fetters and with the
attenuation of lust, hate, and delusion, are once-returners,
returning once to this world to make an end of suffering - by
breasting Mara’s stream they too will get safely across to the fur
ther shore.</P>
<P  >9.
“Just as the calves and the feeble cattle breasted the stream of
the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those
bhikkhus who, with the destruction of three fetters, are
stream-enterers, no longer subject to perdition, bound [for
deliverance], headed for enlightenment - by breasting Mara’s stream
they too will get safely across to the further shore.</P>
<P  >10.
“Just as that tender calf just born, being urged on by its mother’s
lowing, also breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across
to the further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who are Dhamma-followers
and faith-followers - by breasting Mara’s stream they too will get
safely across to the further shore.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote368anc" HREF="#sdendnote368sym"><SUP>ccclxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
“Bhikkhus, I am [227] skilled in this world and in the other world,
skilled in Mara’s realm and in what is outside Mara’s realm,
skilled in the realm of Death and in what is outside the realm of
Death. It will lead to the welfare and happiness for a long time of
those who think they should listen to me and place faith in me.”</P>
<P  >12.
That is what the Blessed One said. When the Sublime One had said
that, the Teacher said further:</P>
<P >
“Both this world and the world beyond</P>
<P >
Are well described by the one who knows,</P>
<P >
And what is still in Mara’s reach</P>
<P >
And what is out of reach of Death.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Knowing directly all the world,</P>
<P >
The Enlightened One who understands</P>
<P >
Opened the door to the deathless state</P>
<P >
By which Nibbana may be safely reached;</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
For Mara’s stream is breasted now,</P>
<P >
Its current blocked, its reeds removed;</P>
<P >
Rejoice then, bhikkhus, mightily</P>
<P >
And set your hearts where safety lies.”</P>
