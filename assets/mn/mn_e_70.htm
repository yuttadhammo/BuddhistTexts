70. Kitagiri Sutta - At Kitagiri</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Kasi country together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I abstain from eating at night. By so doing, I am free
from illness and affliction, and I enjoy health, strength, and a
comfortable abiding. Come, bhikkhus, abstain from eating at night. By
so doing, you too will be free from illness and affliction, and you
will enjoy health, strength, and a comfortable abiding.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote696anc" HREF="#sdendnote696sym"><SUP>dcxcvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” they replied.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, as the Blessed One was wandering by stages in the Kasi country,
he eventually arrived at a Kasi town called Kitagiri. There he lived
in this Kasi town, Kitagiri.</P>
<P  >4.
Now on that occasion the bhikkhus named Assaji and Punabbasuka were
residing at Kitagiri.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote697anc" HREF="#sdendnote697sym"><SUP>dcxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then a number of bhikkhus went and told them: “Friends, the Blessed
One and the Sangha of bhikkhus now abstain from eating at night. By
so doing, they are free from illness and affliction, and they enjoy
health, strength, and a comfortable abiding. Come, friends, abstain
from eating at night. By so doing, you too will be free from illness
and affliction, and you will enjoy health, strength, and a
comfortable abiding.” [474] When this was said, the bhikkhus Assaji
and Punabbasuka told those bhikkhus: “Friends, we eat in the
evening, in the morning, and in the day outside the proper time. By
so doing, we are free from illness and affliction, and we enjoy
health, strength, and a comfortable abiding. Why should we abandon [a
benefit] visible here and now to pursue [a benefit to be achieved] at
a future time? We shall eat in the evening, in the morning, and in
the day outside the proper time.”</P>
<P  >5.
Since the bhikkhus were unable to convince the bhikkhus Assaji and
Punabbasuka, they went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to
him, they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurred,
adding: “Venerable sir, since we were unable to convince the
bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka, we have reported this matter to the
Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >6.
Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: “Come,
bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka in my name that the
Teacher calls them.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” he replied, and he went to the bhikkhus Assaji and
Punabbasuka and told them: “The Teacher calls you, friends.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
friend,” they replied, and they went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One then
said: “Bhikkhus, is it true that when a number of bhikkhus went and
told you: ‘Friends, the Blessed One and the Sangha now abstain from
eating at night … Come, friends, abstain from eating at night [475]
… ,’ you told those bhikkhus: ‘Friends, we eat in the evening …
Why should we abandon [a benefit] visible here and now to pursue [a
benefit to be achieved] at a future time? We shall eat in the
evening, in the morning, and in the day outside the proper time’?”
- “Yes, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“Bhikkhus,
have you known me to teach the Dhamma in such a way as this:
‘Whatever this person experiences, whether pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant, unwholesome states diminish in him and
wholesome states increase’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote698anc" HREF="#sdendnote698sym"><SUP>dcxcviii</SUP></A></SUP>
- “No, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >7.
“Bhikkhus, have you not known me to teach the Dhamma in such a way
as this: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant
feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states
diminish; but when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling,
unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote699anc" HREF="#sdendnote699sym"><SUP>dcxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, when someone feels a certain kind of painful feeling,
unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish; but
when someone feels another kind of painful feeling, unwholesome
states diminish in him and wholesome states increase. Here, when
someone feels a certain kind of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling,
unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states diminish; but
when someone feels another kind of neither-painful-nor-pleasant
feeling, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states
increase’?” - “Yes, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >8.
“Good, bhikkhus.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote700anc" HREF="#sdendnote700sym"><SUP>dcc</SUP></A></SUP>
And if it were unknown by me, unseen, unfound, unrealised,
uncontacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain
kind of pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and
wholesome states diminish,’ would it be fitting for me, not knowing
that, to say: ‘Abandon such a kind of pleasant feeling’?” -
“No, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“But
because it is known by me, seen, found, realised, contacted by wisdom
thus: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain kind of pleasant feeling
[476], unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome states
diminish,’ that I therefore say: ‘Abandon such a kind of pleasant
feeling.’</P>
<P  >“If
it were unknown by me, unseen, unfound, unrealised, uncontacted by
wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels another kind of pleasant
feeling, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states
increase,’ would it be fitting for me, not knowing that, to say:
‘Enter upon and abide in such a kind of pleasant feeling’?” -
“No, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“But
because it is known by me, seen, found, realised, contacted by wisdom
thus: ‘Here, when someone feels another kind of pleasant feeling,
unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states increase,’
that I therefore say: ‘Enter upon and abide in such a kind of
pleasant feeling.’</P>
<P  >9.
“If it were unknown by me … But because it is known by me …
contacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain kind
of painful feeling, unwholesome states increase in him and wholesome
states diminish,’ that I therefore say: ‘Abandon such a kind of
painful feeling.’</P>
<P  >“If
it were unknown by me … But because it is known by me … contacted
by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels another kind of painful
feeling, unwholesome states diminish in him and wholesome states
increase,’ that I therefore say: ‘Enter upon and abide in such a
kind of painful feeling.’</P>
<P  >10.
“If it were unknown by me … But because it is known by me …
contacted by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels a certain kind
of neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states increase
in him and wholesome states diminish,’ that I therefore say:
‘Abandon such a kind of neither-painful nor-pleasant feeling.’</P>
<P  >“If
it were unknown by me … But because it is known by me … contacted
by wisdom thus: ‘Here, when someone feels another kind of
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, unwholesome states diminish in
him and wholesome states increase,’ that I therefore say: [477]
‘Enter upon and abide in such a kind of
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.’</P>
<P  >11.
“Bhikkhus, I do not say of all bhikkhus that they still have work
to do with diligence; nor do I say of all bhikkhus that they have no
more work to do with diligence.</P>
<P  >12.
“I do not say of those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints
destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done,
laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of
being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge, that
they still have work to do with diligence. Why is that? They have
done their work with diligence; they are no more capable of being
negligent.</P>
<P  >13.
“1 say of such bhikkhus who are in higher training, whose minds
have not yet reached the goal, and who are still aspiring to the
supreme security from bondage, that they still have work to do with
diligence. Why is that? Because when those venerable ones make use of
suitable resting places and associate with good friends and balance
their spiritual faculties, they may by realising for themselves with
direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme
goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth
from the home life into homelessness. Seeing this fruit of diligence
for these bhikkhus, I say that they still have work to do with
diligence.</P>
<P  >14.
“Bhikkhus, there are seven kinds of persons to be found existing in
the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote701anc" HREF="#sdendnote701sym"><SUP>dcci</SUP></A></SUP>
What seven? They are: one liberated-inboth ways, one
liberated-by-wisdom, a body-witness, one attained-to-view, one
liberated-by-faith, a Dhamma-follower, and a faith-follower.</P>
<P  >15.
“What kind of person is one liberated-in-both-ways? Here some
person contacts with the body and abides in those <SPAN >liberations
that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, and his taints
are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom. This kind of person is
called one liberated-in-both-ways.</SPAN><SUP><SPAN ><A  NAME="sdendnote702anc" HREF="#sdendnote702sym"><SUP>dccii</SUP></A></SPAN></SUP><SPAN >
I do not say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with
diligence. Why is that?</SPAN> He has done his work with diligence;
he is no more capable of being negligent.</P>
<P  >16.
“What kind of person is one liberated-by-wisdom? Here some person
does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that
are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, but his taints are
destroyed by his seeing with wisdom. This kind of person is called
one liberated-by-wisdom.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote703anc" HREF="#sdendnote703sym"><SUP>dcciii</SUP></A></SUP>
[478] I do not say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do
with diligence. Why is that? He has done his work with diligence; he
is no more capable of being negligent.</P>
<P  >17.
“What kind of person is a body-witness? Here some person contacts
with the body and abides in those liberations that are peaceful and
immaterial, transcending forms, and some of his taints are destroyed
by his seeing with wisdom. This kind of person is called a
body-witness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote704anc" HREF="#sdendnote704sym"><SUP>dcciv</SUP></A></SUP>
I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence.
Why is that? Because when that venerable one makes use of suitable
resting places and associates with good friends and balances his
spiritual faculties, he may by realising for himself with direct
knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of
the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from
the home life into homelessness. Seeing this fruit of diligence for
such a bhikkhu, I say that he still has work to do with diligence.</P>
<P  >18.
“What kind of person is one attained-to-view? Here some person does
not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are
peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, but some of his taints
are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom, and he has reviewed and
examined with wisdom the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata. This
kind of person is called one attained-to-view.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote705anc" HREF="#sdendnote705sym"><SUP>dccv</SUP></A></SUP>
I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence.
Why is that? Because when that venerable one … into homelessness.
Seeing this fruit of diligence for such a bhikkhu, I say that he
still has work to do with diligence.</P>
<P  >19.
“What kind of person is one liberated-by-faith? Here some person
does not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that
are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, but some of his
taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom, and his faith is
planted, rooted, and established in the Tathagata.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote706anc" HREF="#sdendnote706sym"><SUP>dccvi</SUP></A></SUP>
This kind of person is called one liberated-by-faith. I say of such a
bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence. Why is that?
Because when that venerable one [479] … into homelessness.</P>
<P  >Seeing
this fruit of diligence for such a bhikkhu, I say that he still has
work to do with diligence.</P>
<P  >20.
“What kind of person is a Dhamma-follower? Here some person does
not contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are
peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, and his taints are not
yet destroyed by his seeing with wisdom, but with wisdom he has
sufficiently gained a reflective acceptance of those teachings
proclaimed by the Tathagata. Furthermore, he has these qualities: the
faith faculty, the energy faculty, the mindfulness faculty, the
concentration faculty, and the wisdom faculty. This kind of person is
called a Dhamma-follower.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote707anc" HREF="#sdendnote707sym"><SUP>dccvii</SUP></A></SUP>
I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has work to do with diligence.
Why is that? Because when that venerable one … into homelessness.
Seeing this fruit of diligence for such a bhikkhu, I say that he
still has work to do with diligence.</P>
<P  >21.
“What kind of person is a faith-follower? Here some person does not
contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are
peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms, and his taints are not
yet destroyed by his seeing with wisdom, yet he has sufficient faith
in and love for the Tathagata. Furthermore, he has these qualities:
the faith faculty, the energy faculty, the mindfulness faculty, the
concentration faculty, and the wisdom faculty. This kind of person is
called a faith-follower. I say of such a bhikkhu that he still has
work to do with diligence. Why is that? Because when that venerable
one makes use of suitable resting places and associates with good
friends and balances his spiritual faculties, he may by realising for
himself with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in
that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen
rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. Seeing this
fruit of diligence for such a bhikkhu, I say that he still has work
to do with diligence.</P>
<P  >22.
“Bhikkhus, I do not say that final knowledge is achieved all at
once. On the contrary, final knowledge is achieved by gradual
training, by gradual practice, by gradual progress. [480]</P>
<P  >23.
“And how does there come to be gradual training, gradual practice,
gradual progress? Here one who has faith [in a teacher] visits him;
when he visits him, he pays respect to him; when he pays respect to
him, he gives ear; one who gives ear hears the Dhamma; having heard
the Dhamma, he memorises it; he examines the meaning of the teachings
he has memorised; when he examines their meaning, he gains a
reflective acceptance of those teachings; when he has gained a
reflective acceptance of those teachings, zeal springs up in him;
when zeal has sprung up, he applies his will; having applied his
will, he scrutinises; having scrutinised, he strives; resolutely
striving, he realises with the body the ultimate truth and sees it by
penetrating it with wisdom.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote708anc" HREF="#sdendnote708sym"><SUP>dccviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >24.
“There has not been that faith,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote709anc" HREF="#sdendnote709sym"><SUP>dccix</SUP></A></SUP>
bhikkhus, and there has not been that visiting, and there has not
been that paying of respect, and there has not been that giving ear,
and there has not been that hearing of the Dhamma, and there has not
been that memorising of the Dhamma, and there has not been that
examination of the meaning, and there has not been that reflective
acceptance of the teachings, and there has not been that zeal, and
there has not been that application of will, and there has not been
that scrutiny, and there has not been that striving. Bhikkhus, you
have lost your way; bhikkhus, you have been practising the wrong way.
How far you have strayed, misguided men, from this Dhamma and
Discipline!</P>
<P  >25.
“Bhikkhus, there is a four-phrased statement, and when it is
recited a wise man would quickly understand it.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote710anc" HREF="#sdendnote710sym"><SUP>dccx</SUP></A></SUP>
I shall recite it to you, bhikkhus. Try to understand it.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, who are we that we should understand the Dhamma?”</P>
<P  >26.
“Bhikkhus, even with a teacher who is concerned with material
things, an heir to material things, attached to material things, such
haggling [by his disciples] would not be proper: ‘If we get this,
we will do it; if we don’t get this, we won’t do it’; so what
[should be said when the teacher is] the Tathagata, who is utterly
detached from material things?</P>
<P  >27.
“Bhikkhus, for a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the
Teacher’s Dispensation, it is proper that he conduct himself thus:
‘The Blessed One is the Teacher, I am a disciple; the Blessed One
knows, I do not know.’ For a faithful disciple who is intent on
fathoming the Teacher’s Dispensation, the Teacher’s Dispensation
is nourishing and refreshing. For a faithful disciple who is intent
on fathoming the Teacher’s Dispensation, [481] it is proper that he
conduct himself thus: ‘Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and
bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up on my body, but my
energy shall not be relaxed so long as I have not attained what can
be attained by manly strength, manly energy, and manly persistence.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote711anc" HREF="#sdendnote711sym"><SUP>dccxi</SUP></A></SUP>
For a faithful disciple who is intent on fathoming the Teacher’s
Dispensation, one of two fruits may be expected: either final
knowledge here and now or, if there is a trace of clinging left,
non-return.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
