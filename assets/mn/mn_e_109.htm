109. Mahapunnama Sutta - The Greater Discourse on the Full-moon Night</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara's Mother.</P>
<P  >2.
On that occasion - on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1036anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1036sym"><SUP>mxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
on the full-moon night - the Blessed One was seated in the open
surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >3.
Then a certain bhikkhu rose from his seat,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1037anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1037sym"><SUP>mxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands in
reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, said to him:
"Venerable sir, I would ask the Blessed One about a certain point,
if the Blessed One would grant me an answer to my question." - "Sit
on your own seat, bhikkhu, and ask what you like." So the bhikkhu
sat on his own seat and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >4.
"Are these not, venerable sir, the five aggregates affected by
clinging; [16] that is, the material form aggregate affected by
clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the perception
aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate affected by
clinging, and the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging?"</P>
<P  >"These,
bhikkhus, are the five aggregates affected by clinging; that is, the
material form aggregate affected by clinging ... and the
consciousness aggregate affected by clinging."</P>
<P  >Saying,
"Good, venerable sir," the bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One's words. Then he asked him a further question:</P>
<P  >5.
"But, venerable sir, in what are these five aggregates affected by
clinging rooted?"</P>
<P  >"These
five aggregates affected by clinging are rooted in desire,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1038anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1038sym"><SUP>mxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
bhikkhu."</P>
<P  >6.
"Venerable sir, is that clinging the same as these five aggregates
affected by clinging, or is the clinging something apart from the
five aggregates affected by clinging?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1039anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1039sym"><SUP>mxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
that clinging is neither the same as these five aggregates affected
by clinging, nor is the clinging something apart from the five
aggregates affected by clinging. It is the desire and lust in regard
to the five aggregates affected by clinging that is the clinging
there."</P>
<P  >7.
"But, venerable sir, can there be diversity in the desire and lust
regarding these five aggregates affected by clinging?"</P>
<P  >"There
can be, bhikkhu," the Blessed One said. "Here, bhikkhu, someone
thinks thus: 'May my material form be thus in the future; may my
feeling be thus in the future; may my perception be thus in the
future; may my formations be thus in the future; may my consciousness
be thus in the future.' Thus there is diversity in the desire and
lust regarding these five aggregates affected by clinging."</P>
<P  >8.
"But, venerable sir, in what way does the term 'aggregates'
apply to the aggregates?"</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
any kind of material form whatever, whether past, future, or present,
internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or
near - this is the material form aggregate. [17] Any kind of feeling
whatever ... far or near - this is the feeling aggregate. Any kind of
perception whatever ... far or near - this is the perception
aggregate. Any kind of formations whatever ... far or near - this is
the formations aggregate. Any kind of consciousness whatever ... far
or near - this is the consciousness aggregate. It is in this way,
bhikkhu, that the term 'aggregate' applies to the aggregates."</P>
<P  >9.
"What is the cause and condition, venerable sir, for the
manifestation of the material form aggregate? What is the cause and
condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate ... the
perception aggregate ... the formations aggregate ... the
consciousness aggregate?"</P>
<P  >"The
four great elements, bhikkhu, are the cause and condition for the
manifestation of the material form aggregate. Contact is the cause
and condition for the manifestation of the feeling aggregate. Contact
is the cause and the condition for the manifestation of the
perception aggregate. Contact is the cause and condition for the
manifestation of the formations aggregate. Mentality-materiality is
the cause and condition for the manifestation of the consciousness
aggregate.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1040anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1040sym"><SUP>mxl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >10.
"Venerable sir, how does personality view come to be?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1041anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1041sym"><SUP>mxli</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Here,
bhikkhu, an untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for noble
ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no
regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their
Dhamma, regards material form as self, or self as possessed of
material form, or material form as in self, or self as in material
form. He regards feeling as self ... perception as self ...
formations as self ... consciousness as self, or self as possessed of
consciousness, [18] or consciousness as in self, or self as in
consciousness. That is how personality view comes to be."</P>
<P  >11.
"But, venerable sir, how does personality view not come to be?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
bhikkhu, a well-taught noble disciple, who has regard for noble ones
and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for
true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not
regard material form as self, or self as possessed of material form,
or material form as in self, or self as in material form. He does not
regard feeling as self.. perception as self ... formations as self ...
consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or
consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how
personality view does not come to be."</P>
<P  >12.
"What, venerable sir, is the gratification, what is the danger, and
what is the escape in the case of material form? What is the
gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case
of feeling ... in the case of perception ... in the case of
formations ... in the case of consciousness?"</P>
<P  >"The
pleasure and joy, bhikkhu, that arise in dependence on material form
- this is the gratification in the case of material form. Material
form is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change - this is the
danger in the case of material form. The removal of desire and lust,
the abandonment of desire and lust for material form - this is the
escape in the case of material form.</P>
<P  >"The
pleasure and joy that arise in dependence on feeling ... in
dependence on perception ... in dependence on formations ... in
dependence on consciousness - this is the gratification in the case
of consciousness. Consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and.
subject to change - this is the danger in the case of consciousness.
The removal of desire and lust, the abandonment of desire and lust
for consciousness - this is the escape in the case of consciousness."</P>
<P  >13.
"Venerable sir, how does one know, how does one see, so that in
regard to this body with its consciousness and all external signs,
there is no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to
conceit?"</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
any kind of material form whatever, whether past or present, internal
or external, gross or subtle, inferior [19] or superior, far or near
- one sees all material form as it actually is with proper wisdom
thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' Any
kind of feeling whatever ... Any kind of perception whatever ... Any
kind of formations whatever ... Any kind of consciousness whatever ...
one sees all consciousness as it actually is with proper wisdom thus:
'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' It is
when one knows and sees thus that in regard to this body with its
consciousness and all external signs there is no I-making,
mine-making, or underlying tendency to conceit."</P>
<P  >14.
Then, in the mind of a certain bhikkhu this thought arose: "So, it
seems, material form is not self, feeling is not self, perception is
not self, formations are not self, consciousness is not self. What
self, then, will actions done by the not-self affect?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1042anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1042sym"><SUP>mxlii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One, knowing in his mind the thought in the mind of that
bhikkhu, addressed the bhikkhus thus: "It is possible, bhikkhus,
that some misguided man here, obtuse and ignorant, with his mind
dominated by craving, might think that he can outstrip the Teacher's
Dispensation thus: 'So, it seems, material form is not self ...
consciousness is not self. What self, then, will actions done by the
not-self affect?' Now, bhikkhus, you have been trained by me
through interrogation on various occasions in regard to various
things.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1043anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1043sym"><SUP>mxliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
"Bhikkhus, what do you think? Is material form permanent or
impermanent?" - "Impermanent, venerable sir." - "Is what is
impermanent suffering or happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable
sir." - "Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change
fit to be regarded thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my
self'?" - "No, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhus,
what do you think: Is feeling ... perception ... formations ...
consciousness permanent or impermanent?" - "Impermanent,
venerable sir." - [20] "Is what is impermanent suffering</P>
<P  >or
happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable sir." - "Is what is
impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded
thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?" - "No,
venerable sir."</P>
<P  >16.
"Therefore, bhikkhus, any kind of material form whatever, whether
past, future, or present ... all material form should be seen as it
actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am
not, this is not my self.' Any kind of feeling whatever ... Any
kind of perception whatever ... Any kind of formations whatever ...
Any kind of consciousness whatever ... all consciousness should be
seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine,
this I am not, this is not my self.'</P>
<P  >17.
"Seeing thus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes disenchanted
with material form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with
perception, disenchanted with formations, disenchanted with
consciousness.</P>
<P  >18.
"Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion
[his mind] is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the
knowledge: 'It is liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is
destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been
done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'"</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words. Now while this discourse was
being spoken, through not clinging the minds of sixty bhikkhus were
liberated from the taints.<SUP> <A  NAME="sdendnote1044anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1044sym"><SUP>mxliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
