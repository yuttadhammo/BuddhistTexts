137. Salayatanavibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of the Sixfold Base</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you an exposition of the sixfold base.
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." - "Yes, venerable
sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: [216]</P>
<P  >3.
"The six internal bases should be understood. The six external
bases should be understood. The six classes of consciousness should
be understood. The six classes of contact should be understood. The
eighteen kinds of mental exploration should be understood. The
thirty-six positions of beings should be understood. Therein, by
depending on this, abandon that. There are three foundations of
mindfulness that the Noble One cultivates, cultivating which the
Noble One is a teacher fit to instruct a group. Among the teachers of
training it is he that is called the incomparable leader of persons
to be tamed. This is the summary of the exposition of the sixfold
base.</P>
<P  >4.
"'The six internal bases should be understood.' So it was said.
And with reference to what was this said? There are the eye-base, the
ear-base, the nose-base, the tongue-base, the bodybase, and the
mind-base. So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'The
six internal bases should be understood.'</P>
<P  >5.
"'The six external bases should be understood.' So it was said.
And with reference to what was this said? There are the formbase, the
sound-base, the odour-base, the flavour-base, the tangible-base, and
the mind-object-base. So it was with reference to this that it was
said: 'The six external bases should be understood.'</P>
<P  >6.
"'The six classes of consciousness should be understood.' So it
was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are</P>
<P  >eye-consciousness,
ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness,</P>
<P  >tongue-consciousness,
body-consciousness, and mind</P>
<P  >consciousness.
So it was with reference to this that it was said:</P>
<P  >'The
six classes of consciousness should be understood.'</P>
<P  >7.
"'The six classes of contact should be understood.' So it was
said. And with reference to what was this said? There are eyecontact,
ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, and
mind-contact. So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'The
six classes of contact should be understood.'</P>
<P  >8.
"'The eighteen kinds of mental exploration should be
understood.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1235anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1235sym"><SUP>mccxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
So it was said. And with reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >"On
seeing a form with the eye, one explores a form productive of joy,
one explores a form productive of grief, one explores a form
productive of equanimity.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1236anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1236sym"><SUP>mccxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
On hearing a sound with the ear ... On smelling an odour with the
nose ... On tasting a flavour with the tongue ... [217] On touching a
tangible with the body ... On cognizing a mind-object with the mind,
one explores a mind-object productive of joy, one explores a
mind-object productive of grief, one explores a mind-object
productive of equanimity. Thus there are six kinds of exploration
with joy, six kinds of exploration with grief, and six kinds of
exploration with equanimity. So it was with reference to this that it
was said: 'The eighteen kinds of mental exploration should be
understood.'</P>

So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are
six kinds of joy based on the household life and six kinds of joy
based on renunciation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1238anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1238sym"><SUP>mccxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
There are six kinds of grief based on the household life and six
kinds of grief based on renunciation. There are six kinds of
equanimity based on the household life and six kinds of equanimity
based on renunciation.</P>

"Herein, what are the six kinds of joy based on the household life?
When one regards as an acquisition the acquisition of forms
cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable,
gratifying, and associated with worldliness - or when one recalls
what was formerly acquired that has passed, ceased, and changed - joy
arises. Such joy as this is called joy based on the household life.</P>
<P  >"When
one regards as an acquisition the acquisition of sounds cognizable by
the ear ... the acquisition of odours cognizable by the nose ... the
acquisition of flavours cognizable by the tongue ...</P>

of mind-objects cognizable by the mind that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, gratifying, and associated with worldliness - or when one
recalls what was formerly acquired that has passed, ceased, and
changed - joy arises. Such joy as this is called joy based on the
household life. These are the six kinds of joy based on the household
life.</P>
<P  >11.
"Herein, what are the six kinds of joy based on renunciation? When,
by knowing the impermanence, change, fading away, and cessation of
forms, one sees as it actually is with proper wisdom that forms both
formerly and now are all impermanent, suffering, and subject to
change, joy arises. Such joy as this is called joy based on
renunciation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1239anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1239sym"><SUP>mccxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>

mind-objects both formerly and now are all impermanent, suffering,
and subject to change, joy arises. Such joy as this is called joy
based on renunciation. These are the six kinds of joy based on
renunciation.</P>
<P  >12.
"Herein, what are the six kinds of grief based on the household
life? When one regards as a non-acquisition the nonacquisition of
forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable,
gratifying, and associated with worldliness - or when one recalls
what was formerly not acquired that has passed, ceased, and changed -
grief arises. Such grief as this is called grief based on the
household life.</P>

When, by knowing the impermanence, change, fading away, and cessation
of forms, one sees as it actually is with proper wisdom that forms
both formerly and now are all impermanent, suffering, and subject to

now enter upon and abide in?'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1240anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1240sym"><SUP>mccxl</SUP></A></SUP>
In one who generates thus a longing for the supreme liberations,
grief arises with that longing as condition. Such grief as this is
called grief based on renunciation.</P>

"Herein, what are the six kinds of equanimity based on the
household life? On seeing a form with the eye, equanimity arises in a
foolish infatuated ordinary person, in an untaught ordinary person
who has not conquered his limitations or conquered the results [of
action] and who is blind to danger. Such equanimity as this does not
transcend the form; that is why it is called equanimity based on the
household life.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1241anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1241sym"><SUP>mccxli</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P  >"So
it was with reference to this that it was said: 'The thirtysix
positions of beings should be understood.' [220]</P>
<P  >16.
"'Therein, by depending on this, abandon that.' So it was said.
And with reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >"Here,
bhikkhus, by depending and relying on the six kinds of joy based on
renunciation, abandon and surmount the six kinds of joy based on the
household life. It is thus they are abandoned; it is thus they are
surmounted. By depending and relying on the six kinds of grief based
on renunciation, abandon and surmount the six kinds of grief based on
the household life. It is thus they are abandoned; it is thus they

<P  >18.
"And what, bhikkhus, is equanimity that is diversified, based on
diversity? There is equanimity regarding forms, sounds, odours,
flavours, and tangibles. This, bhikkhus, is equanimity that is
diversified, based on diversity.</P>
<P  >19.
"And what, bhikkhus, is equanimity that is unified, based on unity?
There is equanimity regarding the base of infinite space, the base of
infinite consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. This, bhikkhus, is equanimity
that is unified, based on unity.</P>
<P  >20.
"Here, bhikkhus, by depending and relying on equanimity that is
unified, based on unity, abandon and surmount equanimity that is

it was in reference to this that it was said: 'Therein, by

"'There are three foundations of mindfulness that the Noble One

So it was said. And with reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >22.
"Here, bhikkhus, compassionate and seeking their welfare, the
Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of compassion: 'This
is for your welfare; this is for your happiness.' His disciples do
not want to hear or give ear or exert their minds to understand; they
err and turn aside from the Teacher's Dispensation. With that the
Tathagata is not satisfied and feels no satisfaction; yet he dwells
unmoved, mindful, and fully aware. This, bhikkhus, is called the
first foundation of mindfulness that the Noble One cultivates,
cultivating which the Noble One is a teacher fit to instruct a group.</P>
<P  >23.
"Furthermore, bhikkhus, compassionate and seeking their welfare,
the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of compassion:
'This is for your welfare; this is for your happiness.' Some of
his disciples will not hear or give ear or exert their minds to
understand; they err and turn aside from the Teacher's
Dispensation. Some of his disciples will hear and give ear and exert
their minds to understand; they do not err and turn aside from the
Teacher's Dispensation. With that the Tathagata is not satisfied
and feels no satisfaction, and he is not dissatisfied and feels no
dissatisfaction; remaining free from both satisfaction and
dissatisfaction, he dwells in equanimity, mindful, and fully aware.
This, bhikkhus, is called the second foundation of mindfulness that
the Noble One cultivates, cultivating which the Noble One is a
teacher fit to instruct a group.</P>
<P  >24.
"Furthermore, bhikkhus, compassionate and seeking their welfare,
the Teacher teaches the Dhamma to the disciples out of compassion:
'This is for your welfare; this is for your happiness.' His
disciples will hear and give ear and exert their minds to understand;
they do not err and turn aside from the Teacher's Dispensation.
With that the Tathagata is satisfied and feels satisfaction; yet he
dwells unmoved, mindful, and fully aware. This, bhikkhus, is called
the third foundation of mindfulness that the Noble One cultivates,
cultivating which the Noble One is a teacher fit to instruct a group.
[222]</P>
<P  >"So
it was with reference to this that it was said: 'There are three

<P  >"Possessed
of material form, he sees forms: this is the first direction. Not
perceiving forms internally, he sees forms externally: this is the
second direction. He is resolved only upon the beautiful: this is the
third direction. With the complete surmounting of perceptions of
form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is
infinite,' he enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space:
this is the fourth direction. By completely surmounting the base of
infinite space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite,' he enters
upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness: this is the
fifth direction. By completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing,' he enters upon and
abides in the base of nothingness: this is the sixth direction. By
completely surmounting the base of nothingness, he enters upon and
abides in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception: this is
the seventh direction. By completely surmounting the base of
neitherperception-nor-non-perception, he enters upon and abides in
the cessation of perception and feeling: this is the eighth
direction.</P>
