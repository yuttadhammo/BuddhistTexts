118. Anapanasati Sutta - Mindfulness of Breathing</H2>
<H3 >(INTRODUCTORY SECTION)</H3>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara's Mother,
together with many very well-known elder disciples - the venerable
Sariputta, the venerable Maha Moggallana, the venerable Maha Kassapa,
the venerable Maha Kaccana, the venerable Maha Kotthita, the
venerable Maha Kappina, the venerable Maha Cunda, [79] the venerable
Anuruddha, the venerable Revata, the venerable Ananda, and other very
well-known elder disciples.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing
new bhikkhus; some elder bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing
ten new bhikkhus, some elder bhikkhus had been teaching and
instructing twenty ... thirty ... forty new bhikkhus. And the new
bhikkhus, taught and instructed by the elder bhikkhus, had achieved
successive stages of high distinction.</P>
<P  >3.
On that occasion - the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, on the
full-moon night of the Pavarana ceremony<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1115anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1115sym"><SUP>mcxv</SUP></A></SUP>
- the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of
bhikkhus. Then, surveying the silent Sangha of bhikkhus, he addressed
them thus:</P>
<P  >4.
"Bhikkhus, I am content with this progress. My mind is content with
this progress. So arouse still more energy to attain the unattained,
to achieve the unachieved, to realise the unrealised. I shall wait
here at Savatthi for the Komudi full moon of the fourth month."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1116anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1116sym"><SUP>mcxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
The bhikkhus of the countryside heard: "The Blessed One will wait
there at Savatthi for the Komudi full moon of then fourth month."
And the bhikkhus of the countryside left in due course for Savatthi
to see the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >6.
And elder bhikkhus still more intensively taught and instructed new
bhikkhus; some elder bhikkhus taught and instructed ten new bhikkhus,
some elder bhikkhus taught and instructed twenty ... thirty ... forty
new bhikkhus. And the new bhikkhus, taught and instructed by the
elder bhikkhus, [80] achieved successive stages of high distinction.</P>
<P  >7.
On that occasion - the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon
night of the Komudi full moon of the fourth month - the Blessed One
was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then,
surveying the silent Sangha of bhikkhus, he addressed them thus:</P>
<P  >8.
"Bhikkhus, this assembly is free from prattle, this assembly is
free from chatter. It consists purely of heartwood. Such is this
Sangha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly. Such an assembly as is
worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy
of reverential salutation, an incomparable field of merit for the
world - such is this Sangha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly. Such
an assembly that a small gift given to it becomes great and a great
gift greater - such is this Sangha of bhikkhus, such is this
assembly. Such an assembly as is rare for the world to see - such is
this Sangha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly. Such an assembly as
would be worth journeying many leagues with a travel-bag to see -
such is this Sangha of bhikkhus, such is this assembly.</P>
<P  >9.
"In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who are arahants
with taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to
be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the
fetters of being, and are completely liberated through final
knowledge - such bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >10.
"In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who, with the
destruction of the five lower fetters, are due to reappear
spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain final Nibbana,
without ever returning from that world - such bhikkhus are there in
this Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >11.
"In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who, with the
destruction of three fetters and with the attenuation of lust, hate,
and delusion, are once-returners, returning once to this world [81]
to make an end of suffering - such bhikkhus are there in this Sangha
of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >12.
"In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who, with the
destruction of the three fetters, are stream-enterers, no longer
subject to perdition, bound [for deliverance], headed for
enlightenment - such bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >13.
"In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who abide devoted to
the development of the four foundations of mindfulness - such
bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus. In this Sangha of
bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of
the four right kinds of striving ... of the four bases for spiritual
power ... of the five faculties ... of the five powers ... of the
seven enlightenment factors ... of the Noble Eightfold Path - such
bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of bhikkhus.</P>
<P  >14.
"In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are bhikkhus who abide devoted to
the development of loving-kindness [82] ... of compassion.. . of
appreciative joy ... of equanimity ... of the meditation on foulness
... of the perception of impermanence - such bhikkhus are there in
this Sangha of bhikkhus. In this Sangha of bhikkhus there are
bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of mindfulness of
breathing.</P>
<H3 >(MINDFULNESS OF BREATHING)</H3>
<P  >15.
"Bhikkhus, when mindfulness of breathing is developed and
cultivated, it is of great fruit and great benefit. When mindfulness
of breathing is developed and cultivated, it fulfils the four
foundations of mindfulness. When the four foundations of mindfulness
are developed and cultivated, they fulfil the seven enlightenment
factors. When the seven enlightenment factors are developed and
cultivated, they fulfil true knowledge and deliverance.</P>
<P  >16.
"And how, bhikkhus, is mindfulness of breathing developed and
cultivated, so that it is of great fruit and great benefit?</P>
<P  >17.
"Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to
an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his
body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him, ever mindful
he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.</P>
<P  >18.

'I breathe in long'; or breathing out long, he understands: 'I

'I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body [of breath]';
trains thus: 'I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily
formation'; trains thus: 'I shall breathe out tranquillising the
bodily formation' - on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating
the body as a body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world. I say that this is a certain
body among the bodies, namely, in-breathing and out-breathing.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1122anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1122sym"><SUP>mcxxii</SUP></A></SUP>

the world. I say that this is a certain feeling among the feelings,
namely, giving close attention to in-breathing and out-breathing.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1123anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1123sym"><SUP>mcxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>

mindfulness of breathing for one who is forgetful, who is not fully
aware. That is why on that occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating
mind as mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1124anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1124sym"><SUP>mcxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

"Bhikkhus, on whatever occasion a bhikkhu abides contemplating the
body as a body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world - on that occasion unremitting
mindfulness is established in him. On whatever occasion unremitting
mindfulness is established in a bhikkhu - on that occasion the
mindfulness enlightenment factor is aroused in him, and he develops
it, and by development, it comes to fulfilment in him.</P>

"Abiding thus mindful, he investigates and examines that state with
wisdom and embarks upon a full inquiry into it. On whatever occasion,
abiding thus mindful, a bhikkhu investigates and examines that state
with wisdom and embarks upon a full inquiry into it - on that
occasion the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor is aroused
in him, and he develops it, and by development it comes to fulfilment
in him.</P>
<P  >32.
"In one who investigates and examines that state with wisdom and
embarks upon a full inquiry into it, tireless energy is aroused. On
whatever occasion tireless energy is aroused in a bhikkhu who
investigates and examines that state with wisdom and embarks upon a
full inquiry into it - on that occasion the energy enlightenment
factor is aroused in him, and he develops it, and by development it
comes to fulfilment in him.</P>
<P  >33.
"In one who has aroused energy, unworldly rapture arises. On
whatever occasion unworldly rapture arises in a bhikkhu who has
aroused energy - [86] on that occasion the rapture enlightenment
factor is aroused in him, and he develops it, and by development it
comes to fulfilment in him.</P>
<P  >34.
"In one who is rapturous, the body and the mind become tranquil. On
whatever occasion the body and the mind become tranquil in a bhikkhu
who is rapturous - on that occasion the tranquillity enlightenment
factor is aroused in him, and he develops it, and by development it
comes to fulfilment in him.</P>

"In one whose body is tranquil and who feels pleasure, the mind
becomes concentrated. On whatever occasion the mind becomes
concentrated in a bhikkhu whose body is tranquil and who feels
pleasure - on that occasion the concentration enlightenment factor is
