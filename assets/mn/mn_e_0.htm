<H3 >PART ONE: THE ROOT FIFTY DISCOURSES</H3>
<OL>
<LI VALUE=1><P >Malapariyaya
Sutta: The Root of All Things. The Buddha analyses the cognitive
processes of four types of individuals - the untaught ordinary
person, the disciple in higher training, the arahant, and the
Tathagata. This is one of the deepest and most difficult suttas in
the Pali Canon, and it is therefore suggested that the earnest
student read it only in a cursory manner on a first reading of the
Majjhima Nikaya, returning to it for an in-depth study after
completing the entire collection.</P>
<LI><P >Sabbasava
Sutta: All the Taints. The Buddha teaches the bhikkhus seven methods
for restraining and abandoning the taints, the fundamental
defilements that maintain bondage to the round of birth and death.</P>
<LI><P >Dhammadayada
Sutta: Heirs in Dhamma. The Buddha enjoins the bhikkhus to be heirs
in Dhamma, not heirs in material things. The venerable Sariputta
then continues on the same theme by explaining how disciples should
train themselves to become the Buddha's heirs in Dhamma.</P>
<LI><P >Bhayabherava
Sutta: Fear and Dread. The Buddha describes to a brahmin the
qualities required of a monk who wishes to live alone in the forest.

bhikkhu becomes blemished when he falls under the sway of evil
wishes.</P>
<LI><P >Akankheyya

he then goes on to enumerate the benefits that a bhikkhu can reap by
properly fulfilling the training.</P>
<LI><P >Vatthupama
Sutta: The Simile of the Cloth. With a simple simile the Buddha
illustrates the difference between a defiled mind and a pure mind.</P>
<LI><P >Sallekha
Sutta: Effacement. The Buddha rejects the view that the mere
attainment of the meditative absorptions is effacement and explains
how effacement is properly practised in his teaching.</P>
<LI><P >Sammaditthi
Sutta: Right View. A long and important discourse by the venerable
Sariputta, with separate sections on the wholesome and the
unwholesome, nutriment, the Four Noble Truths, the twelve factors of
dependent origination, and the taints.</P>
<LI><P >Satipatthana
Sutta: The Foundations of Mindfulness. This is one of the fullest
and most important suttas by the Buddha dealing with meditation,
with particular emphasis on the development of insight. The Buddha
begins by declaring the four foundations of mindfulness to be the
direct path for the realisation of Nibbana, then gives detailed
instructions on the four foundations: the contemplation of the body,
feelings, mind, and mind-objects.</P>
<LI><P >Culasthanada
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Lion's Roar. The Buddha
declares that only in his Dispensation can the four grades of noble
individuals be found, explaining how his teaching can be
distinguished from other creeds through its unique rejection of all
doctrines of self.</P>
<LI><P >Mahasthanada

conditions under which he should go elsewhere.</P>
<LI><P >Madhupindika

to a pernicious view that conduct prohibited by the Buddha is not
really an obstruction. The Buddha reprimands him and, with a series
of memorable similes, stresses the dangers in misapplying and
misrepresenting the Dhamma. The sutta culminates in one of the most
impressive disquisitions on non-self found in the Canon.</P>
<LI><P >Vammika Sutta:
The Ant-hill. A deity presents a monk with an obscure riddle, which
is unravelled for him by the Buddha.</P>

two discourses emphasise that the proper goal of the holy life is
the unshakeable deliverance of the mind, to which all other benefits
are subsidiary.</P>
<LI><P >Culagosinga
Sutta: The Shorter Discourse in Gosinga. The Buddha meets three
bhikkhus who are living in concord, "blending like milk and
water," and inquires how they succeed in living together so
harmoniously.</P>
<LI><P >Mahagosinga
Sutta: The Greater Discourse in Gosinga. On a beautiful moonlit
night a number of senior disciples meet together in a sala-tree wood

about, but when he finally meets the Buddha their discussion takes
some unexpected turns.</P>
<LI><P >Mahasaccaka
Sutta: The Greater Discourse to Saccaka. The Buddha meets again with
Saccaka and in the course of a discussion on "development of body"
and "development of mind" he relates a detailed narrative on his
own spiritual quest.</P>

Sutta: The Shorter Discourse on the Destruction of Craving. The
venerable Maha Moggallana overhears the Buddha give a brief
explanation to Sakka, ruler of gods, as to how a bhikkhu is
liberated through the destruction of craving. Wishing to know if
Sakka understood the meaning, he makes a trip to the heaven of the
Thirty-three to find out.</P>
<LI><P >Mahatanhasankhaya
Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving. A
bhikkhu named Sati promulgates the pernicious view that the same

<LI><P >Brahmanimantanika
Sutta: The Invitation of a Brahma. Baka the Brahma, a high divinity,
