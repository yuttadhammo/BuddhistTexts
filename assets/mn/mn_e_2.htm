2. Sabbasava Sutta - All the Taints</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on the restraint of all
the taints.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote32anc" HREF="#sdendnote32sym"><SUP>xxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
[7] Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." - "Yes,
venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<H3 >(SUMMARY)</H3>
<P  >3.
"Bhikkhus, I say that the destruction of the taints is for one who
knows and sees, not for one who does not know and see. Who knows and
sees what? Wise attention and unwise attention.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote33anc" HREF="#sdendnote33sym"><SUP>xxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
When one attends unwisely, unarisen taints arise and arisen taints
increase. When one attends wisely, unarisen taints do not arise and
arisen taints are abandoned.</P>
<P  >4.
"Bhikkhus, there are taints that should be abandoned by seeing.
There are taints that should be abandoned by restraining. There are
taints that should be abandoned by using. There are taints that
should be abandoned by enduring. There are taints that should be
abandoned by avoiding. There are taints that should be abandoned by
removing. There are taints that should be abandoned by developing.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote34anc" HREF="#sdendnote34sym"><SUP>xxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY SEEING)</H3>
<P  >5.
"What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by seeing?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote35anc" HREF="#sdendnote35sym"><SUP>xxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for
noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who
has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in
their Dhamma, does not understand what things are fit for attention
and what things are unfit for attention. Since that is so, he attends
to those things unfit for attention and he does not attend to those
things fit for attention.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote36anc" HREF="#sdendnote36sym"><SUP>xxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
"What are the things unfit for attention that he attends to? They
are things such that when he attends to them, the unarisen taint of
sensual desire arises in him and the arisen taint of sensual desire
increases, the unarisen taint of being arises in him and the arisen
taint of being increases, the unarisen taint of ignorance arises in
him and the arisen taint of ignorance increases. These are the things
unfit for attention that he attends to.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote37anc" HREF="#sdendnote37sym"><SUP>xxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
And what are the things fit for attention that he does not attend to?
They are things such that when he attends to them, the unarisen taint
of sensual desire does not arise in him and the arisen taint of
sensual desire is abandoned, the unarisen taint of being does not
arise in him and the arisen taint of being is abandoned, the unarisen
taint of ignorance does not arise in him and the arisen taint of
ignorance is abandoned. These are the things fit for attention that
he does not attend to. [8] By attending to things unfit for attention
and by not attending to things fit for attention, both unarisen
taints arise in him and arisen taints increase.</P>
<P  >7.
"This is how he attends unwisely: 'Was I in the past? Was I not
in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having
been what, what did I become in the past? Shall I be in the future?
Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How
shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I become in
the future?' Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the present
thus: 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being
come from? Where will it go?'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote38anc" HREF="#sdendnote38sym"><SUP>xxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
"When he attends unwisely in this way, one of six views arises in
him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote39anc" HREF="#sdendnote39sym"><SUP>xxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
The view 'self exists for me' arises in him as true and
established; or the view 'no self exists for me' arises in him as
true and established; or the view 'I perceive self with self'
arises in him as true and established; or the view 'I perceive
notself with self' arises in him as true and established; or the
view 'I perceive self with not-self' arises in him as true and
established; or else he has some such view as this: 'It is this
self of mine that speaks and feels and experiences here and there the
result of good and bad actions; but this self of mine is permanent,
everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and it will endure as
long as eternity.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote40anc" HREF="#sdendnote40sym"><SUP>xl</SUP></A></SUP>
This speculative view, bhikkhus, is called the thicket of views, the
wilderness of views, the contortion of views, the vacillation of
views, the fetter of views. Fettered by the fetter of views, the
untaught ordinary person is not freed from birth, ageing, and death,
from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; he is not freed
from suffering, I say.</P>
<P  >9.
"Bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple, who has regard for noble
ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard
for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma,
understands what things are fit for attention and what things are
unfit for attention. Since that is so, [9] he does not attend to
those things unfit for attention and he attends to those things fit
for attention.</P>
<P  >10.
"What are the things unfit for attention that he does not attend
to? They are things such that when he attends to them, the unarisen
taint of sensual desire arises in him … (as §6) … and the arisen
taint of ignorance increases. These are the things unfit for
attention that he does not attend to. And what are the things fit for
attention that he attends to? They are things such that when he
attends to them, the unarisen taint of sensual desire does not arise
in him … (as §6) … and the arisen taint of ignorance is
abandoned. These are the things fit for attention that he attends to.
By not attending to things unfit for attention and by attending to
things fit for attention, unarisen taints do not arise in him and
arisen taints are abandoned.</P>
<P  >11.
"He attends wisely: 'This is suffering'; he attends wisely:
'This is the origin of suffering'; he attends wisely: 'This is
the cessation of suffering'; he attends wisely: 'This is the way
leading to the cessation of suffering.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote41anc" HREF="#sdendnote41sym"><SUP>xli</SUP></A></SUP>
When he attends wisely in this way, three fetters are abandoned in
him: personality view, doubt, and adherence to rules and observances.
These are called the taints that should be abandoned by seeing.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote42anc" HREF="#sdendnote42sym"><SUP>xlii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY RESTRAINING)</H3>
<P  >12.
"What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by restraining?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote43anc" HREF="#sdendnote43sym"><SUP>xliii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here a bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, abides with the eye faculty
restrained. While taints, vexation, and fever might arise in one who
abides with the eye faculty unrestrained, there are no taints,
vexation, or fever in one who abides with the eye faculty
restrained.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote44anc" HREF="#sdendnote44sym"><SUP>xliv</SUP></A></SUP>
Reflecting wisely, he abides with the ear faculty restrained … with
the nose faculty restrained … with the tongue faculty restrained …
with the body faculty restrained … with the mind faculty restrained
… While taints, vexation, and fever might arise in one who abides
with the faculties unrestrained, [10] there are no taints, vexation,
or fever in one who abides with the faculties restrained. These are
called the taints that should be abandoned by restraining.</P>
<H3 >(TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY USING)</H3>
<P  >13.
"What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by using?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote45anc" HREF="#sdendnote45sym"><SUP>xlv</SUP></A></SUP>
Here a bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, uses the robe only for protection
from cold, for protection from heat, for protection from contact with
gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the sun, and creeping things, and only
for the purpose of concealing the private parts.</P>
<P  >14.
"Reflecting wisely, he uses almsfood neither for amusement nor for
intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attractiveness,
but only for the endurance and continuance of this body, for ending
discomfort, and for assisting the holy life, considering: 'Thus I
shall terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I
shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort.'</P>
<P  >15.
"Reflecting wisely, he uses the resting place only for protection
from cold, for protection from heat, for protection from contact with
gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the sun, and creeping things, and only
for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and for enjoying
retreat.</P>
<P  >16.
"Reflecting wisely, he uses the medicinal requisites only for
protection from arisen afflicting feelings and for the benefit of
good health.</P>
<P  >17.
"While taints, vexation, and fever might arise in one who does not
use the requisites thus, there are no taints, vexation, or fever in
one who uses them thus. These are called the taints that should be
abandoned by using.</P>
<H3 >(TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY ENDURING)</H3>
<P  >18.
"What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by enduring? Here a
bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, bears cold and heat, hunger and</P>
<P  >thirst,
and contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the sun, and creeping
things; he endures ill-spoken, unwelcome words and arisen bodily
feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, disagreeable,
distressing, and menacing to life. While taints, vexation, and fever
might arise in one who does not endure such things, there are no
taints, vexation, or fever in one who endures them. These are called
the taints that should be abandoned by enduring.</P>
<H3 >(TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY AVOIDING)</H3>
<P  >19.
"What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by avoiding? Here a
bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a
wild bull, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, [11] a bramble patch, a
chasm, a cliff, a cesspit, a sewer. Reflecting wisely, he avoids
sitting on unsuitable seats, wandering to unsuitable resorts<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote46anc" HREF="#sdendnote46sym"><SUP>xlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
and associating with bad friends, since if he were to do so wise
companions in the holy life might suspect him of evil conduct. While
taints, vexation, and fever might arise in one who does not avoid
these things, there are no taints, vexation, and fever in one who
avoids them. These are called the taints that should be abandoned by
avoiding.</P>
<H3 >(TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY REMOVING)</H3>
<P  >20.
"What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by removing? Here a
bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, does not tolerate an arisen thought of
sensual desire; he abandons it, removes it, does away with it, and
annihilates it. He does not tolerate an arisen thought of ill will …
He does not tolerate an arisen thought of cruelty … He does not
tolerate arisen evil unwholesome states; he abandons them, removes
them, does away with them, and annihilates them.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote47anc" HREF="#sdendnote47sym"><SUP>xlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
While taints, vexation, and fever might arise in one who does not
remove these thoughts, there are no taints, vexation, or fever in one
who removes them. These are called the taints that should be
abandoned by removing.</P>
<H3 >(TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY DEVELOPING)</H3>
<P  >21.
"What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by developing? Here a
bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, develops the mindfulness enlightenment
factor, which is supported by seclusion, dispassion, and cessation,
and ripens in relinquishment. He develops the investigation-of-states
enlightenment factor … the energy enlightenment factor … the
rapture enlightenment factor … the tranquillity enlightenment
factor … the concentration enlightenment factor … the equanimity
enlightenment factor, which is supported by seclusion, dispassion,
and cessation, and ripens in relinquishment.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote48anc" HREF="#sdendnote48sym"><SUP>xlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
While taints, vexation, and fever might arise in one who does not
develop these enlightenment factors, there are no taints, vexation,
or fever in one who develops them. These are called the taints that
should be abandoned by developing.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote49anc" HREF="#sdendnote49sym"><SUP>xlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H5 >(CONCLUSION)</H5>
<P  >22.
"Bhikkhus, when for a bhikkhu the taints that should be abandoned
by seeing have been abandoned by seeing, when the taints that should
be abandoned by restraining have been abandoned by restraining, when
the taints that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by
using, when the taints that should be abandoned by enduring have been
abandoned by enduring, when the taints that should be abandoned by
avoiding [12] have been abandoned by avoiding, when the taints that
should be abandoned by removing have been abandoned by removing, when
the taints that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned
by developing - then he is called a bhikkhu who dwells restrained
with the restraint of all the taints. He has severed craving, flung
off the fetters, and with the complete penetration of conceit he has
made an end of suffering."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote50anc" HREF="#sdendnote50sym"><SUP>l</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
