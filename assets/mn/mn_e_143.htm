143. Anathapindikovada Sutta - Advice to Anathapindika</H2>
<P  >[258]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the householder Anathapindika was afflicted,
suffering, and gravely ill. Then he addressed a certain man thus:
"Come, good man, go to the Blessed One, pay homage in my name with
your head at his feet, and say: 'Venerable sir, the householder
Anathapindika is afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill; he pays
homage with his head at the Blessed One's feet.' Then go to the
venerable Sariputta, pay homage in my name with your head at his
feet, and say: 'Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is
afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill; he pays homage with his head
at the venerable Sariputta's feet.' Then say: 'It would be
good, venerable sir, if the venerable Sariputta would come to the
residence of the householder Anathapindika, out of compassion.'"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," the man replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side and
delivered his message. Then he went to the venerable Sariputta, and
after paying homage to the venerable Sariputta, he delivered his
message, saying: "It would be good, venerable sir, if the venerable
Sariputta would come to the residence of the householder
Anathapindika, out of compassion." The venerable Sariputta
consented in silence.</P>
<P  >3.
Then the venerable Sariputta dressed, and taking his bowl and outer
robe, went to the residence of the householder Anathapindika with the
venerable Ananda as his attendant. Having gone there, [259] he sat
down on a seat made ready and said to the householder Anathapindika:
"I hope you are getting well, householder, I hope you are
comfortable. I hope your</P>
<P  >painful
feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that their subsiding,
not their increase, is apparent."</P>
<P  >4.
"Venerable Sariputta, I am not getting well, I am not comfortable.
My painful feelings are increasing, not subsiding; their increase and
not their subsiding is apparent. Just as if a strong man were
splitting my head open with a sharp sword, so too, violent winds cut
through my head. I am not getting well ... Just as if a strong man
were tightening a tough leather strap around my head as a headband,
so too, there are violent pains in my head. I am not getting well ...
Just as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve up an
ox's belly with a sharp butcher's knife, so too, violent winds
are carving up my belly. I am not getting well ... Just as if two
strong men were to seize a weaker man by both arms and roast him over
a pit of hot coals, so too, there is a violent burning in my body. I
am not getting well, I am not comfortable. My painful feelings are
increasing, not subsiding; their increase and not their subsiding is
apparent."</P>
<P  >5.
"Then, householder, you should train thus: 'I will not cling to
the eye, and my consciousness will not be dependent on the eye.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1305anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1305sym"><SUP>mcccv</SUP></A></SUP>
Thus you should train. You should train thus: 'I will not cling to
the ear ... I will not cling to the nose ... 1 will not cling to the
tongue ... I will not cling to the body ... I will not cling to the
mind, and my consciousness will not be dependent on the mind.' Thus

<P  >6.

I will not cling to sounds ... I will not cling to odours. . .1 will

<P  >8.
"Householder, you should train thus: 'I will not cling to
eye-contact ... [260] ... I will not cling to ear-contact ... I will
not cling to nose-contact ... I will not cling to tongue-contact ...
I will not cling to body-contact ... I will not cling to

<P  >9.

earth element ... I will not cling to the water element ... I will
not cling to the fire element ... I will not cling to the air element
... I will not cling to the space element ... I will not cling to the

consciousness ... I will not cling to the base of nothingness [261] ...
I will not cling to the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception,
and my consciousness will not be dependent on the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.' Thus you should train.</P>
<P  >13.
"Householder, you should train thus: 'I will not cling to this
world, and my consciousness will not be dependent on this world. I
will not cling to the world beyond, and my consciousness will not be
dependent on the world beyond.' Thus you should train.</P>
<P  >14.
"Householder, you should train thus: 'I will not cling to what is
seen, heard, sensed, cognized, encountered, sought after, and
examined by the mind, and my consciousness will not be dependent on
that.' Thus you should train."</P>
<P  >15.
When this was said, the householder Anathapindika wept and shed
tears. Then the venerable Ananda asked him: "Are you foundering,
householder, are you sinking?"</P>
<P  >"I
am not foundering, venerable Ananda, I am not sinking. But although I
have long waited upon the Teacher and bhikkhus worthy of esteem,
never before have I heard such a talk on the Dhamma."</P>
<P  >"Such
talk on the Dhamma, householder, is not given to lay people clothed
in white. Such talk on the Dhamma is given to those who have gone
forth."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1306anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1306sym"><SUP>mcccvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Well
then, venerable Sariputta, let such talk on the Dhamma be given to
lay people clothed in white. There are clansmen with little dust in
their eyes who are wasting away through not hearing [such talk on]
the Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma."</P>
<P  >16.
Then, after giving the householder Anathapindika this advice, the
venerable Sariputta and the venerable Ananda rose from their seats
and departed. Soon after they had left, [262] the householder
Anathapindika died and reappeared in the Tusita heaven.</P>
<P  >17.
Then, when the night was well advanced, Anathapindika, now a young
god of beautiful appearance, went to the Blessed One, illuminating
the whole of Jeta's Grove. After paying homage to the Blessed One,
he stood at one side and addressed the Blessed One in stanzas:</P>
<P >
"Oh blessed is this Jeta's Grove,</P>
<P >
Dwelt in by the sagely Sangha,</P>
<P >
Wherein resides the King of Dhamma,</P>
<P >
The fount of all my happiness.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
By action, knowledge and Dhamma,</P>
<P >
By virtue and noble way of life â€“</P>
<P >
By these are mortals purified,</P>
<P >
Not by lineage or wealth.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Therefore a wise person who sees</P>
<P >
What truly leads to his own good,</P>
<P >
Should investigate the Dhamma</P>
<P >
And purify himself with it.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Sariputta has reached the peak</P>
<P >
In virtue, peace, and wisdom's ways;</P>
<P >
Any bhikkhu who has gone beyond</P>
<P >
At best can only equal him."</P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >18.
That is what the young god Anathapindika said, and the Teacher
approved. Then the young god Anathapindika, thinking: "The Teacher
has approved of me," paid homage to the Blessed One, and keeping
him on his right, he vanished at once.</P>
<P  >19.
When the night had ended, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
thus: "Bhikkhus, last night when the night was well advanced, there
came to me a certain young god of beautiful appearance who
illuminated the whole of Jeta's Grove. After paying homage to me,
he stood at one side and addressed me in stanzas thus:</P>
<P >
'Oh blessed is this Jeta's Grove ...</P>
<P >
At best can only equal him.' [263]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >That
is what the young god said. Then the young god, thinking: 'The
Teacher has approved of me,' paid homage to me, and keeping me on
his right, he vanished at once."</P>
<P  >20.
When this was said, the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One:
"Surely, venerable sir, that young god must have been
Anathapindika. For the householder Anathapindika had perfect
confidence in the venerable Sariputta."</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, Ananda! You have deduced the right conclusion. That young god
was Anathapindika, no one else."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
