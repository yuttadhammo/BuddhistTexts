136. Mahakammavibhanga Sutta - The Greater Exposition of Action</H2>
<P  >[207]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Samiddhi was living in a forest
hut. Then the wanderer Potaliputta, while wandering and walking for
exercise, went to the venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings with
him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down
at one side and said to the venerable Samiddhi:</P>
<P  >"Friend
Samiddhi, I heard and learned this from the recluse Gotama's own
lips: 'Bodily action is vain, verbal action is vain, only r ental
action is real.' And: 'There is that attainment on ente ig which
one does not feel anything at all.'"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1226anc" HREF="#sdendnote1226sym"><SUP>mccxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Do
not say so, friend Potaliputta, do not say so. Do not misrepresent
the Blessed One; it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The
Blessed One would not speak thus: 'Bodily action is vain, verbal
action is vain, only mental action is real.' But, friend, there is
that attainment on entering which one does not feel anything at all."</P>
<P  >"How
long is it since you went forth, friend Samiddhi?" "Not long,
friend: three years."</P>
<P  >"There
now, what shall we say to the elder bhikkhus when a young bhikkhu
thinks the Teacher is to be defended thus? Friend Samiddhi, having
done an intentional action by way of body, speech, or mind, what does
one feel?"</P>
<P  >"Having
done an intentional action by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels
suffering, friend Potaliputta."</P>
<P  >Then,
neither approving nor disapproving of the venerable Samiddhi's
words, the wanderer Potaliputta rose from his seat and departed.</P>
<P  >3.
Soon after the wanderer Potaliputta had left, the venerable Samiddhi
went to the venerable Ananda [208] and exchanged greetings with him.
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and reported to the venerable Ananda his entire conversation
with the wanderer Potaliputta. After he had spoken, the venerable
Ananda told him: "Friend Samiddhi, this conversation should be told
to the Blessed One. Come, let us approach the Blessed One and tell
him this. As the Blessed One explains to us, so we shall bear it in
mind." - "Yes, friend," the venerable Samiddhi replied.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the venerable Ananda and the venerable Samiddhi went together to
the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one
side. The venerable Ananda reported</P>
<P  >to
the Blessed One the entire conversation between the venerable
Samiddhi and the wanderer Potaliputta.</P>
<P  >5.
When he had finished, the Blessed One told the venerable Ananda:
"Ananda, I do not even recall ever having seen the wanderer
Potaliputta, so how could there have been this conversation? Though
the wanderer Potaliputta's question should have been analysed
before being answered, this misguided man answered it one-sidedly."</P>
<P  >6.
When this was said, the venerable Udayin said to the Blessed One:
"Venerable sir, perhaps the venerable Samiddhi spoke thus referring
to [the principle]: 'Whatever is felt is suffering.'"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1227anc" HREF="#sdendnote1227sym"><SUP>mccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Then
the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda: "See, Ananda, how
this misguided man Udayin interferes. I knew, Ananda, that this
misguided man Udayin would unduly interfere right now. From the start
the wanderer Potaliputta had asked about the three kinds of feeling.
This misguided man Samiddhi [209] would have answered the wanderer
Potaliputta rightly if, when asked thus, he would have explained:
'Friend Potaliputta, having done an intentional action by way of
body, speech, or mind [whose result is] to be felt as pleasant, one
feels pleasure. Having done an intentional action by way of body,
speech, or mind [whose result is] to be felt as painful, one feels
pain. Having done an intentional action by way of body, speech, or
mind [whose result is] to be felt as neither-pain-nor-pleasure, one
feels neither-pain-nor-pleasure.' But who are these foolish,
thoughtless wanderers of other sects, that they could understand the
Tathagata's great exposition of action? You should listen, Ananda,
to the Tathagata as he expounds the great exposition of action."</P>
<P  >7.
"This is the time, Blessed One, this is the time, Sublime One, for
the Blessed One to expound the great exposition of action. Having
heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it."</P>
<P  >"Then
listen, Ananda, and attend closely to what I shall say." "Yes,
venerable sir," the venerable Ananda replied. The Blessed One said
this:</P>
<P  >8.
"Ananda,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1228anc" HREF="#sdendnote1228sym"><SUP>mccxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
there are four kinds of persons to be found existing in the world.
What four? Here some person kills living beings, takes what is not
given, misconducts himself in sensual pleasures, speaks falsehood,
speaks maliciously, speaks harshly, gossips; he is covetous, has a
mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. On the dissolution of the
body, after death, he reappears in a state of deprivation, in an
unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.</P>
<P  >"But
here some person kills living beings … and holds wrong view. On the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world.</P>
<P  >"Here
some person abstains from killing living beings, from taking what is
not given, from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from false speech,
from malicious speech, [210] from harsh speech, from gossip; he is
not covetous, his mind is without ill will, and he holds right view.
On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world.</P>
<P  >"But
here some person abstains from killing living beings … and he holds
right view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears
in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition,
even in hell.</P>
<P  >9.
"Here, Ananda, by means of ardour, endeavour, devotion, diligence,
and right attention, some recluse or brahmin attains such
concentration of mind that, when his mind is concentrated, with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees that
person here who kills living beings … and holds wrong view, and he
sees that on the dissolution of the body, after death, he has
reappeared in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in
perdition, even in hell. He says thus: 'Indeed, there are evil
actions, there is result of misconduct; for I saw a person here who
killed living beings … and held wrong view, and I see that on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he has reappeared in a state of
deprivation … even in hell.' He says thus: 'On the dissolution
of the body, after death, everyone who kills living beings … and
holds wrong view reappears in a state of deprivation … even in
hell. Those who know thus know rightly; those who think otherwise are
mistaken.' Thus he obstinately adheres to what he himself has
known, seen, and discovered, insisting: 'Only this is true,
anything else is wrong.'</P>

"But here, Ananda, [211] by means of ardour … some recluse or
