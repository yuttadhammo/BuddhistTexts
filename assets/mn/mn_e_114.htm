114. Sevitabbasevitabba Sutta - To Be Cultivated and Not To Be
Cultivated</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on what should be
cultivated and what should not be cultivated. Listen and attend
closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes, venerable sir,” the
bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<H3 >(FIRST EXPOSITION)</H3>
<P  >3.
“Bhikkhus,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1069anc" HREF="#sdendnote1069sym"><SUP>mlxix</SUP></A></SUP>
bodily conduct is of two kinds, I say: to be cultivated and not to be
cultivated. And bodily conduct is either the one or the other.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1070anc" HREF="#sdendnote1070sym"><SUP>mlxx</SUP></A></SUP>
Verbal conduct is of two kinds, I say: to be cultivated and not to be
cultivated. And verbal conduct is either the one or the other. Mental
conduct is of two kinds, I say: to be cultivated and not to be
cultivated. And mental conduct is either the one or the other.
Inclination of mind is of two kinds, I say: to be cultivated and not
to be cultivated. And inclination of mind is either the one or the
other. [46] The acquisition of perception is of two kinds, I say: to
be cultivated and not to be cultivated. And the acquisition of
perception is either the one or the other. The acquisition of view is
of two kinds, I say: to be cultivated and not to be cultivated. And
the acquisition of view is either the one or the other. The
acquisition of individuality is of two kinds, I say: to be cultivated
and not to be cultivated. And the acquisition of individuality is
either the one or the other.”</P>

<P  >4.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta said to the Blessed One:
“Venerable sir, I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed
One’s utterance, which he has spoken in brief without expounding
the detailed meaning, to be thus:</P>
<P  >5.
“‘Bhikkhus, bodily conduct is of two kinds, I say: to be
cultivated and not to be cultivated. And bodily conduct is either the
one or the other.’ So it was said by the Blessed One. And with
reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, such bodily conduct as causes unwholesome states to increase and
wholesome states to diminish in one who cultivates it should not be
cultivated. But such bodily conduct as causes unwholesome states to
diminish and wholesome states to increase in one who cultivates it
should be cultivated.</P>
<P  >“And
what kind of bodily conduct causes unwholesome states to increase and
wholesome states to diminish in one who cultivates it? Here someone
kills living beings; he is murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows
and violence, merciless to living beings. He takes what is not given;
he takes by way of theft the wealth and property of others in the
village or in the forest. He misconducts himself in sensual
pleasures; he has intercourse with such women as are protected by
their mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, or
relatives, who have a husband, who are protected by law, and even
with those who are garlanded in token of betrothal. Such bodily
conduct [47] causes unwholesome states to increase and wholesome
states to diminish in one who cultivates it.</P>
<P  >“And
what kind of bodily conduct causes unwholesome states to diminish and
wholesome states to increase in one who cultivates it? Here someone,
abandoning the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living
beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gently and kindly, he abides
compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is
not given, he abstains from taking what is not given; he does not
take by way of theft the wealth and property of others in the village
or in the forest. Abandoning misconduct in sensual pleasures, he
abstains from misconduct in sensual pleasures; he does not have
intercourse with such women as are protected by their mother, father,
mother and father, brother, sister, or relatives, who have a husband,
who are protected by law, or with those who are garlanded in token of
betrothal. Such bodily conduct causes unwholesome states to diminish
and wholesome states to increase in one who cultivates it.</P>
<P  >“So
it was with reference to this that it was said by the Blessed One:
‘Bhikkhus, bodily conduct is of two kinds, I say: to be cultivated
and not to be cultivated. And bodily conduct is either the one or the
other.’</P>
<P  >6.
“‘Bhikkhus, verbal conduct is of two kinds, I say: to be
cultivated and not to be cultivated. And verbal conduct is either the
one or the other.’ So it was said by the Blessed One. And with
reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, such verbal conduct as causes unwholesome states to increase and
wholesome states to diminish in one who cultivates it should not be
cultivated. But such verbal conduct as causes unwholesome states to
diminish and wholesome states to increase in one who cultivates it

<P  >“And
what kind of verbal conduct causes unwholesome states to increase and
wholesome states to diminish in one who cultivates it? Here someone
speaks falsehood; when summoned to a court, or to a meeting, [48] or
to his relatives’ presence, or to his guild, or to the royal
family’s presence, and questioned as a witness thus: ‘So, good
man, tell what you know,’ not knowing, he says, ‘I know,’ or
knowing, he says, ‘I do not know’; not seeing, he says, ‘I
see,’ or seeing, he says, I do not see’; in full awareness he
speaks falsehood for his own ends, or for another’s ends, or for
some trifling worldly end. He speaks maliciously; he repeats
elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide [those people]
from these, or he repeats to these people what he has heard elsewhere
in order to divide [these people] from those; thus he is one who
divides those who are united, a creator of divisions, who enjoys
discord, rejoices in discord, delights in discord, a speaker of words
that create discord. He speaks harshly; he utters such words as are
rough, hard, hurtful to others, offensive to others, bordering on
anger, unconducive to concentration. He is a gossip; he speaks at the
wrong time, speaks what is not fact, speaks what is useless, speaks
contrary to the Dhamma and the Discipline; at the wrong time he
speaks such words as are worthless, unreasonable, immoderate, and
unbeneficial. Such verbal conduct causes unwholesome states to
increase and wholesome states to diminish in one who cultivates it.</P>
<P  >“And
what kind of verbal. conduct causes unwholesome states to diminish
and wholesome states to increase in one who cultivates it? Here
someone, abandoning false speech, abstains from false speech; when

not knowing, he says, ‘I do not know,’ or knowing, he says, ‘I

‘I see’; [49] he does not in full awareness speak falsehood for
his own ends, or for another’s ends, or for some trifling worldly
end. Abandoning malicious speech, he abstains from malicious speech;
he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to
divide [those people] from these, nor does he repeat to these people
what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide [these people] from
those; thus he is one who reunites those who are divided, a promoter
of friendships, who enjoys concord, rejoices in concord, delights in
concord, a speaker of words that promote concord. Abandoning harsh
speech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks such words as are
gentle, pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to the heart, are
courteous, desired by many, and agreeable to many. Abandoning gossip,
he abstains from gossip; he speaks at the right time, speaks what is
fact, speaks on what is good, speaks on the Dhamma and the
Discipline; at the right time he speaks such words as are worth
recording, reasonable, moderate, and beneficial. Such verbal conduct
causes unwholesome states to diminish and wholesome states to
increase in one who cultivates it.</P>
<P  >“So
it was with reference to this that it was said by the Blessed One:

other.’</P>
<P  >7.

<P  >“And
what kind of mental conduct causes unwholesome states to increase and
wholesome states to diminish in one who cultivates it? Here someone
is covetous; he covets the wealth and property of others thus: ‘Oh,
may what belongs to another be mine!’ Or he has a mind of ill will
and intentions of hate [50] thus: ‘May these beings be slain and
slaughtered, may they be cut off, perish, or be annihilated!’ Such
mental conduct causes unwholesome states to increase and wholesome
states to diminish in one who cultivates it.</P>
<P  >“And
what kind of mental conduct causes unwholesome states to diminish and
wholesome states to increase in one who cultivates it? Here someone
is not covetous; he does not covet the wealth and property of others
thus: ‘Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!’ His mind is
without ill will and he has intentions free from hate thus: ‘May
these beings be free from enmity, affliction, and anxiety! May they
live happily!’ Such mental conduct causes unwholesome states to
