67. Catuma Sutta - At Catuma</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Catuma in a myrobalan grove.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion five hundred bhikkhus headed by the venerable
Sariputta and the venerable Maha Moggallana had come to Catuma to see
the Blessed One. While the visiting bhikkhus were exchanging
greetings with the resident bhikkhus, and were preparing resting
places and putting away their bowls and outer robes, they were very
loud and noisy.</P>
<P  >3.
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda thus: "Ananda,
who are these loud noisy people? One would think they were fishermen
hawking fish."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote682anc" HREF="#sdendnote682sym"><SUP>dclxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, they are five hundred bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and
Moggallana who have come to Catuma to see the Blessed One. And while
the visiting bhikkhus were exchanging greetings with the resident
bhikkhus, and were preparing resting places and putting away their
bowls and outer robes, they have been very loud and noisy."</P>
<P  >4.
"Then, Ananda, tell those bhikkhus in my name that the Teacher
calls the venerable ones."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," he replied, and he went to those bhikkhus and told
them: "The Teacher calls the venerable ones."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
friend," they [457] replied, and they went to the Blessed One, and
after paying homage to him, sat down at one side. When they had done
so, the Blessed One asked them: "Bhikkhus, why are you so loud and
noisy? One would think you were fishermen hawking fish."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, we are five hundred bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and Moggallana
who have come to Catuma to see the Blessed One. And it was while we
visiting bhikkhus were exchanging greetings with the resident
bhikkhus, and were preparing resting places and putting away our
bowls and outer robes, that we were very loud and noisy."</P>
<P  >5.
"Go, bhikkhus, I dismiss you. You cannot live with me."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," they replied, and they rose from their seats, and
after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on their right,
they put away the things in their resting places, and taking their
bowls and outer robes, they departed.</P>
<P  >6.
Now on that occasion the Sakyans of Catuma had met together in their
assembly hall for some business or other. Seeing the bhikkhus coming
in the distance, they went to them and asked: "Where are you going,
venerable sirs?"</P>
<P  >"Friends,
the Sangha of bhikkhus has been dismissed by the Blessed One."</P>
<P  >"Then
let the venerable ones be seated awhile. Perhaps we shall be able to
restore his confidence."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
friends," they replied.</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Sakyans of Catuma went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, they sat down at one side and said:</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, let the Blessed One delight in the Sangha of bhikkhus; venerable
sir, let the Blessed One welcome the Sangha of bhikkhus; venerable
sir, let the Blessed One show compassion towards the Sangha of
bhikkhus now as he used to show compassion towards it in the past.
Venerable sir, there are new bhikkhus here, just gone forth, recently
come to this Dhamma and Discipline. If they get no opportunity to see
the Blessed One, there may take place in them some change or
alteration. Venerable sir, just as when young seedlings get no water
there may take place in them some change or alteration, so too,
venerable sir, there are [458] new bhikkhus here, just gone forth,
recently come to this Dhamma and Discipline. If they get no
opportunity to see the Blessed One, there may take place in them some
change or alteration. Venerable sir, just as when a young calf does
not see its mother there may take place in it some change or
alteration, so too, venerable sir, there are new bhikkhus here, just
gone forth, recently come to this Dhamma and Discipline. If they get
no opportunity to see the Blessed One, there may take place in them
some change or alteration. Venerable sir, let the Blessed One delight
in the Sangha of the bhikkhus; venerable sir, let the Blessed One
welcome the Sangha of bhikkhus; venerable sir, let the Blessed One
show compassion towards the Sangha of bhikkhus now as he used to show
compassion towards it in the past."</P>
<P  >8.
Then the Brahma Sahampati<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote683anc" HREF="#sdendnote683sym"><SUP>dclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
knew with his mind the thought in the Blessed One's mind, so just
as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his
extended arm, he vanished in the Brahma-world and appeared before the
Blessed One. Then he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and
extending his hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed
One, he said:</P>
<P  >9.
"Venerable sir, let the Blessed One delight in the Sangha of
bhikkhus; venerable sir, let the Blessed One welcome the Sangha of
bhikkhus; … (as in §7) … [459] now as he used to show compassion
towards it in the past."</P>
<P  >10.
The Sakyans of Catuma and the Brahma Sahampati were able to restore
the Blessed One's confidence with the similes of the seedlings and
the young calf.</P>
<P  >11.
Then the venerable Maha Moggallana addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Get
up, friends, take your bowls and outer robes. The Blessed One's
confidence has been restored by the Sakyans of Catuma and the Brahma
Sahampati with the similes of the seedlings and the young calf."</P>
<P  >12.
"Yes, friend," they replied, and taking their bowls and outer
robes, they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him,
sat down at one side. When they had done so, the Blessed One asked
the venerable Sariputta: "What did you think, Sariputta, when the
Sangha of bhikkhus was dismissed by me?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, I thought thus: 'The Sangha of bhikkhus has been dismissed by
the Blessed One. The Blessed One will now abide inactive, devoted to
pleasant abiding here and now; and we too shall now abide inactive,
devoted to pleasant abiding here and now.'"</P>
<P  >"Stop,
Sariputta, stop! Such a thought should not be entertained by you
again"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote684anc" HREF="#sdendnote684sym"><SUP>dclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Maha Moggallana: "What
did you think, Moggallana, when the Sangha of bhikkhus was dismissed
by me?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, I thought thus: 'The Sangha of bhikkhus has been dismissed by
the Blessed One. The Blessed One will now abide inactive, devoted to
pleasant abiding here and now. Now the venerable Sariputta and I
shall lead the Sangha of bhikkhus.'"</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, Moggallana! Either I shall lead the Sangha of bhikkhus or else
Sariputta and Moggallana shall lead it."</P>
<P  >14.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhus,
there are these four kinds of fears to be expected by those who go
down to the water.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote685anc" HREF="#sdendnote685sym"><SUP>dclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
What are the four? They are: fear of waves, fear of crocodiles, fear
of whirlpools, and fear of sharks. These are the four kinds of fears
to be expected by those who go down to the water.</P>
<P  >15.
"So too, bhikkhus, there are four kinds of fears to be expected by
certain persons who have gone forth from the home life into
homelessness in this Dhamma and Discipline. What are [460] the four?
They are: fear of waves, fear of crocodiles, fear of whirlpools, and
fear of sharks.</P>
<P  >16.
"What, bhikkhus, is fear of waves? Here some clansman goes forth
out of faith from the home life into homelessness, considering: 'I
am a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to
suffering. Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be
known.' Then, after he has gone forth thus, his companions in the
holy life advise and instruct him thus: 'You should move to and fro
thus; you should look ahead and look away thus; you should flex and
extend the limbs thus; you should wear the patched cloak, bowl, and
robes thus.' Then he thinks: 'Formerly, when we were in the home
life, we advised and instructed others, and now these [bhikkhus], who
seem like they might be our sons or our grandsons, think that they
can advise and instruct us.' And so he forsakes the training and
reverts to the low life. He is called one who has forsaken the
training and reverted to the low life because he was frightened by
the fear of waves. Now 'waves' is a term for angry despair.</P>
<P  >17.
"What, bhikkhus, is fear of crocodiles? Here some clansman goes
forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, considering:
'I am a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to
suffering. Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be
known.' Then, after he has gone forth thus, his companions in the
holy life advise and instruct him thus: 'This can be consumed by
you, this cannot be consumed by you; this can be eaten by you, this
cannot be eaten by you; this can be tasted by you, this cannot be
tasted by you; this can be drunk by you, this cannot be drunk by
you.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote686anc" HREF="#sdendnote686sym"><SUP>dclxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
You can consume what is allowable, you cannot consume what is not
allowable; you can eat what is allowable, you cannot eat what is not
allowable; you can taste what is allowable, you cannot taste what is
not allowable; you can drink what is allowable, you cannot drink what
is not allowable. You can consume food within the proper time, you
cannot consume food outside the proper time; you can eat within the
proper time, you cannot eat outside the proper time; you can taste
food within the proper time, you cannot taste food outside the proper
time; you can drink within the proper time, you cannot drink outside
the proper time.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote687anc" HREF="#sdendnote687sym"><SUP>dclxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
[461]</P>
<P  >"Then
he thinks: 'Formerly, when we were in the home life, we consumed
what we liked and did not consume what we did not like; we ate what
we liked and did not eat what we did not like; we tasted what we
liked and did not taste what we did not like; we drank what we liked
and did not drink what we did not like. We consumed what was
allowable and what was not allowable; we ate what was allowable and
what was not allowable; we tasted what was allowable and what was not
allowable; we drank what was allowable and what was not allowable. We
consumed food within the proper time and outside the proper time; we
ate within the proper time and outside the proper time; we tasted
food within the proper time and outside the proper time; we drank
within the proper time and outside the proper time. Now, when
faithful householders give us good food of various kinds during the
day outside the proper time, it seems these [bhikkhus] put a muzzle
on our mouths.' And so he forsakes the training and reverts to the
low life. He is called one who has forsaken the training and reverted
to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of crocodiles.
Now 'crocodiles' is a term for gluttony.</P>
<P  >18.
"What, bhikkhus, is fear of whirlpools? Here some clansman goes
forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, considering:
'I am a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to
suffering. Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be
known.' Then, after he has gone forth thus, when it is morning he
dresses, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he goes into a village
or town for alms with his body unguarded, with his speech unguarded,
with mindfulness unestablished, and with sense faculties
unrestrained. He sees some householder there or householder's son
furnished and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure
enjoying himself with them. He considers thus: 'Formerly, when we
were in the home life, we were furnished and endowed with the five
cords of sensual pleasure and we enjoyed ourselves with them. My
family has wealth; I can both enjoy wealth and make merit.' And so
he forsakes the training and reverts to the low life. He is called
one who has forsaken the training and reverted to the low life
because he was frightened by the fear of whirlpools. Now 'whirlpools'
is a term for the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >19.
"What, bhikkhus, is fear of sharks? Here [462] some clansman goes
forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, considering:
'I am a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to
suffering. Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be
known.' Then, after he has gone forth thus, when it is morning he
dresses, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he goes into a village
or town for alms with his body unguarded, with his speech unguarded,
with mindfulness unestablished, and with sense faculties
unrestrained. He sees a woman there lightly clothed, lightly dressed.
When he sees such a woman, lust infects his mind. Because his mind
has been infected by lust, he forsakes the training and reverts to
the low life. He is called one who has forsaken the training and
reverted to the low life because he was frightened by the fear of
sharks. Now 'sharks' is a term for women.</P>
<P  >20.
"Bhikkhus, these are the four kinds of fears to be expected by
certain persons who have gone forth from the home life into
homelessness in this Dhamma and Discipline."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
