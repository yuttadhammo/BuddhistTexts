36. Mahasaccaka Sutta - The Greater Discourse to Saccaka</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion, when it was morning, the Blessed One had
finished dressing and had taken his bowl and outer robe, desiring to
go into Vesali for alms.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, as Saccaka the Nigantha's son was walking and wandering for
exercise, he came to the Hall with the Peaked Roof in the Great
Wood.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote380anc" HREF="#sdendnote380sym"><SUP>ccclxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
The venerable Ananda saw him coming in the distance and said to the
Blessed One: "Venerable sir, here comes Saccaka the Nigantha's
son, a debater and a clever speaker regarded by many as a saint. He
wants to discredit the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. It would
be good if the Blessed One would sit down for a while out of
compassion."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote381anc" HREF="#sdendnote381sym"><SUP>ccclxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready. Then Saccaka the
Nigantha's son went up to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings
with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat
down at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >4.
"Master Gotama, there are some recluses and brahmins who abide
pursuing development of body, but not development of mind.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote382anc" HREF="#sdendnote382sym"><SUP>ccclxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
They are touched by bodily painful feeling. In the past, when one was
touched by bodily painful feeling, one's thighs would become rigid,
one's heart would burst, hot blood would gush from one's mouth,
and one would go mad, go out of one's mind. So then the mind was
subservient to the body, the body wielded mastery over it. Why is
that? [238] Because the mind was not developed. But there are some
recluses and brahmins who abide pursuing development of mind, but not
development of body. They are touched by mental painful feeling. In
the past, when one was touched by mental painful feeling, one's
thighs would become rigid, one's heart would burst, hot blood would
gush from one's mouth, and one would go mad, go out of one's
mind. So then the body was subservient to the mind, the mind wielded
mastery over it. Why is that? Because the body was not developed.
Master Gotama, it has occurred to me: 'Surely Master Gotama's
disciples abide pursuing development of mind, but not development of
body.'"</P>
<P  >5.
"But, Aggivessana, what have you learned about development of
body?"</P>
<P  >"Well,
there are, for example, Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sankicca, Makkhali
Gosala.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote383anc" HREF="#sdendnote383sym"><SUP>ccclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
They go naked, rejecting conventions, licking their hands, not coming
when asked, not stopping when asked; they do not accept food brought
or food specially made or an invitation to a meal; they receive
nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across a threshold, across a stick,
across a pestle, from two eating together, from a pregnant woman,
from a woman giving suck, from a woman lying with a man, from where
food is advertised to be distributed, from where a dog is waiting,
from where flies are buzzing; they accept no fish or meat, they drink
no liquor, wine, or fermented brew. They keep to one house, to one
morsel; they keep to two houses, to two morsels … they keep to
seven houses, to seven morsels. They live on one saucerful a day, on
two saucerfuls a day … on seven saucerfuls a day. They take food
once a day, once every two days … once every seven days, and so on
up to once every fortnight; they dwell pursuing the practice of
taking food at stated intervals."</P>
<P  >6.
"But do they subsist on so little, Aggivessana?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama, sometimes they consume excellent hard food, eat
excellent soft food, taste excellent delicacies, drink excellent
drinks. Thereby they again regain their strength, fortify themselves,
and become fat."</P>
<P  >"What
they earlier abandoned, Aggivessana, they later gather together
again. That is how there is increase and decrease of this body. But
what have you learned about development of mind?" [239]</P>
<P  >When
Saccaka the Nigantha's son was asked by the Blessed One about
development of mind, he was unable to answer.</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One told him: "What you have just spoken of as
development of body, Aggivessana, is not development of body
according to the Dhamma in the Noble One's</P>
<P  >Discipline.
Since you do not know what development of body is, how could you know
what development of mind is? Nevertheless, Aggivessana, as to how one
is undeveloped in body and undeveloped in mind, listen and attend
closely to what I shall say." - "Yes, sir," Saccaka the
Nigantha's son replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >8.
"How, Aggivessana, is one undeveloped in body and undeveloped in
mind? Here, Aggivessana, pleasant feeling arises in an untaught
ordinary person. Touched by that pleasant feeling, he lusts after
pleasure and continues to lust after pleasure. That pleasant feeling
of his ceases. With the cessation of the pleasant feeling, painful
feeling arises. Touched by that painful feeling, he sorrows, grieves,
and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught. When
that pleasant feeling has arisen in him, it invades his mind and
remains because body is not developed. And when that painful feeling
has arisen in him, it invades his mind and remains because mind is
not developed. Anyone in whom, in this double manner, arisen pleasant
feeling invades his mind and remains because body is not developed,
and arisen painful feeling invades his mind and remains because mind
is not developed, is thus undeveloped in body and undeveloped in
mind.</P>
<P  >9.
"And how, Aggivessana, is one developed in body and developed in
mind? Here, Aggivessana, pleasant feeling arises in a well-taught
noble disciple. Touched by that pleasant feeling, he does not lust
after pleasure or continue to lust after pleasure. That pleasant
feeling of his ceases. With the cessation of the pleasant feeling,
painful feeling arises. Touched by that painful feeling, he does not
sorrow, grieve, and lament, he does not weep beating his breast and
become distraught. When that pleasant feeling has arisen in him, it
does not invade his mind and remain because body is developed. And
when that painful feeling has arisen in him, it does not invade his
mind and remain because mind is developed. Anyone in whom, in this
double manner, arisen pleasant feeling [240] does not invade his mind
and remain because body is developed, and arisen painful feeling does
not invade his mind and remain because mind is developed, is thus
developed in body and developed in mind."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote384anc" HREF="#sdendnote384sym"><SUP>ccclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >10.
"I have confidence in Master Gotama thus: 'Master Gotama is
developed in body and developed in mind.'"</P>
<P  >"Surely,
Aggivessana, your words are offensive and discourteous, but still I
will answer you. Since I shaved off my hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness, it
has not been possible for arisen pleasant feeling to invade my mind
and remain or for arisen painful feeling to invade my mind and
remain."</P>
<P  >11.
"Has there never arisen in Master Gotama a feeling so pleasant that
it could invade his mind and remain? Has there never arisen in Master
Gotama a feeling so painful that it could invade his mind and
remain?"</P>
<P  >12.
"Why not, Aggivessana?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote385anc" HREF="#sdendnote385sym"><SUP>ccclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, Aggivessana, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an
unenlightened Bodhisatta, I thought: 'Household life is crowded and
dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living in
a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished
shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe,
and go forth from the home life into homelessness.'</P>
<P  >13-16.
"Later, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with
the blessing of youth, in the prime of life … (as Sutta 26,
§§14-17) … And I sat down there thinking: 'This will serve for
striving.'</P>
<P  >17.
"Now these three similes occurred to me spontaneously, never heard
before. Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood lying in water,
and a man came with an upper fire-stick, thinking: 'I shall light a
fire, I shall produce heat.' What do you think, Aggivessana? Could
the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper fire-stick
and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood lying in the
water?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Why not? Because it is a wet sappy piece of wood,
[241] and it is lying in water. Eventually the man would reap only
weariness and disappointment."</P>
<P  >"So
too, Aggivessana, as to those recluses and brahmins who still do not
live bodily and mentally withdrawn from sensual pleasures, and whose
sensual desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and fever for sensual
pleasures has not been fully abandoned and suppressed internally,
even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful, racking,
piercing feelings due to exertion, they are incapable of knowledge
and vision and supreme enlightenment; and even if those good recluses
and brahmins do not feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
exertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme
enlightenment. This was the first simile that occurred to me
spontaneously, never heard before.</P>
<P  >18.
"Again, Aggivessana, a second simile occurred to me spontaneously,
never heard before. Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood
lying on dry land far from water, and a man came with an upper
fire-stick, thinking: 'I shall light a fire, I shall produce heat.'
What do you think, Aggivessana? Could the man light a fire and
produce heat by taking the upper fire-stick and rubbing it against
the wet sappy piece of wood lying on dry land far from water?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Why not? Because it is a wet sappy piece of wood, even
though it is lying on dry land far from water. Eventually the man
would reap only weariness and disappointment."</P>
<P  >"So
too, Aggivessana, as to those recluses and brahmins who live bodily
and mentally withdrawn from sensual pleasures,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote386anc" HREF="#sdendnote386sym"><SUP>ccclxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
but whose sensual desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and fever
for sensual pleasures has not been fully abandoned and suppressed
internally, even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful,
racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, they are incapable of
knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment; and even if those
good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful, racking, piercing
feelings due to exertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision
and supreme enlightenment. This was the second simile that occurred
to me spontaneously, never heard before.</P>
<P  >19.
"Again, Aggivessana, a third simile occurred to me [242]
spontaneously, never heard before. Suppose there were a dry sapless
piece of wood lying on dry land far from water, and a man came with
an upper fire-stick, thinking: 'I shall light a fire, I shall
produce heat.' What do you think, Aggivessana? Could the man light
a fire and produce heat by rubbing it against the dry sapless piece
of wood lying on dry land far from water?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
Master Gotama. Why so? Because it is a dry sapless piece of wood, and
it is lying on dry land far from water."</P>
<P  >"So
too, Aggivessana, as to those recluses and brahmins who live bodily
and mentally withdrawn from sensual pleasures, and whose sensual
desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and fever for sensual
pleasures has been fully abandoned and suppressed internally, even if
those good recluses and brahmins feel painful, racking, piercing

exertion, they are capable of knowledge and vision and supreme
enlightenment.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote387anc" HREF="#sdendnote387sym"><SUP>ccclxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
This was the third simile that occurred to me spontaneously, never
heard before. These are the three similes that occurred to me
spontaneously, never heard before.</P>

"1 thought: 'Suppose, with my teeth clenched and my tongue
pressed against the roof of my mouth, I beat down, constrain, and
crush mind with mind.' So, with my teeth clenched and my tongue
pressed against the roof of my mouth, I beat down, constrained, and
crushed mind with mind. While I did so, sweat ran from my armpits.
Just as a strong man might seize a weaker man by the head or
shoulders and beat him down, constrain him, and crush him, so too,
with my teeth clenched and my tongue pressed against the roof of my
mouth, I beat down, constrained, and crushed mind with mind, and
sweat ran from my armpits. But although tireless energy was aroused
in me and unremitting mindfulness was established, my body was
overwrought [243] and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful
striving. But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my
mind and remain.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote388anc" HREF="#sdendnote388sym"><SUP>ccclxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >21.
"I thought: 'Suppose I practise the breathingless meditation.'
So I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth and
nose. While I did so, there was a loud sound of winds coming out from
my earholes. Just as there is a loud sound when a smith's bellows
are blown, so too, while I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths
through my nose and ears, there was a loud sound of winds coming out
from my earholes. But although tireless energy was aroused in me and
unremitting mindfulness was established, my body was overwrought and
uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful striving. But such
painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >22.
"I thought: 'Suppose I practise further the breathingless
meditation.' So I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my
mouth, nose, and ears. While I did so, violent winds cut through my
head. Just as if a strong man were splitting my head open with a
sharp sword, so too, while I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths
through my mouth, nose, and ears, violent winds cut through my head.
But although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting
mindfulness was established, my body was overwrought and uncalm
because I was exhausted by the painful striving. But such painful
feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >23.
"I thought: 'Suppose I practise further the breathingless
meditation.' So I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my
mouth, nose, and ears. While I did so, there were violent pains in my
head. Just as if a strong man [244] were tightening a tough leather
strap around my head as a headband, so too, while I stopped the
in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and ears, there
were violent pains in my head. But although tireless energy was
aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established, my body
was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful
striving. But such painful feeling that arose in me did not invade my
mind and remain.</P>
<P  >24.
"I thought: 'Suppose I practise further the breathingless
meditation.' So I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my
mouth, nose, and ears. While I did so, violent winds carved up my
belly. Just as if a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to carve
up an ox's belly with a sharp butcher's knife, so too, while I
stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and
ears, violent winds carved up my belly. But although tireless energy
was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established, my
body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the
painful striving. But such painful feeling that arose in me did not
invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >25.
"I thought: 'Suppose I practise further the breathingless
meditation.' So I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my
mouth, nose, and ears. While I did so, there was a violent burning in
my body. Just as if two strong men were to seize a weaker man by both
arms and roast him over a pit of hot coals, so too, while I stopped
the in-breaths and out-breaths through my mouth, nose, and ears,
there was a violent burning in my body. But although tireless energy
was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established, my
body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the
painful striving. But such painful feeling that arose in me did not
invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >26.
"Now when [245] deities saw me, some said: 'The recluse Gotama is
dead.' Other deities said: 'The recluse Gotama is not dead, he is
dying.' And other deities said: 'The recluse Gotama is not dead
nor dying; he is an arahant, for such is the way arahants abide.'</P>
<P  >27.
"I thought: 'Suppose I practise entirely cutting off food.'
Then deities came to me and said: 'Good sir, do not practise
entirely cutting off food. If you do so, we shall infuse heavenly
food into the pores of your skin and you will live on that.' I
considered: 'If I claim to be completely fasting while these
deities infuse heavenly food into the pores of my skin and I live on
that, then I shall be lying.' So I dismissed those deities, saying:
'There is no need.'</P>
<P  >28.
"I thought: 'Suppose I take very little food, a handful each
time, whether of bean soup or lentil soup or vetch soup or pea soup.'
So I took very little food, a handful each time, whether of bean soup
or lentil soup or vetch soup or pea soup. While I did so, my body
reached a state of extreme emaciation. Because of eating so little my
limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems.
Because of eating so little my backside became like a camel's hoof.
Because of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth
like corded beads. Because of eating so little my ribs jutted out as
gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn. Because of eating
so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets,
looking like the gleam of water that has sunk far down in a deep
well. Because of eating so little my scalp shrivelled and withered as
[246] a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sun.
Because of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone;
thus if I touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone and if I
touched my backbone I encountered my belly skin. Because of eating so
little, if I urinated or defecated, I fell over on my face there.
Because of eating so little, if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my
limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell from my body
as I rubbed.</P>
<P  >29.
"Now when people saw me, some said: 'The recluse Gotama is
black.' Other people said: 'The recluse Gotama is not black, he
is brown.' Other people said: 'The recluse Gotama is neither
black nor brown, he is golden-skinned.' So much had the clear,
bright colour of my skin deteriorated through eating so little.</P>
<P  >30.
"1 thought: 'Whatever recluses or brahmins in the past have
experienced painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, this
is the utmost, there is none beyond this. And whatever recluses and
brahmins in the future will experience painful, racking, piercing
feelings due to exertion, this is the utmost, there is none beyond
this. And whatever recluses and brahmins at present experience
painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, this is the
utmost, there is none beyond this. But by this racking practice of
austerities I have not attained any superhuman states, any
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Could
there be another path to enlightenment?'</P>
<P  >31.
"1 considered: 'I recall that when my father the Sakyan was
occupied, while I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree,
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, I entered upon and abided in the first jhana, which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote389anc" HREF="#sdendnote389sym"><SUP>ccclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Could that be the path to enlightenment?' Then, following on that
memory, came the realisation: 'That is the path to enlightenment.'</P>
<P  >32.
"I thought: 'Why [247] am I afraid of that pleasure that has
nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states?' I
thought: 'I am not afraid of that pleasure since it has nothing to
do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote390anc" HREF="#sdendnote390sym"><SUP>cccxc</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >33.
"I considered: 'It is not easy to attain that pleasure with a
body so excessively emaciated. Suppose I ate some solid food - some
boiled rice and bread.' And I ate some solid food - some boiled
rice and bread. Now at that time five bhikkhus were waiting upon me,
thinking: 'If our recluse Gotama achieves some higher state, he
will inform us.' But when I ate the boiled rice and bread, the five
bhikkhus were disgusted and left me, thinking: 'The recluse Gotama
now lives luxuriously; he has given up his striving and reverted to
luxury.'</P>
<P  >34.
"Now when I had eaten solid food and regained my strength, then
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, I entered upon and abided in the first jhana, which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion. But such pleasant feeling that arose in
me did not invade my mind and remain.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote391anc" HREF="#sdendnote391sym"><SUP>cccxci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >35-37.
"With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, I entered upon
and abided in the second jhana … With the fading away as well of
rapture … I entered upon and abided in the third jhana … With the
abandoning of pleasure and pain … I entered upon and abided in the
fourth jhana … But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not
invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >38.
"When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, [248] I directed it to knowledge of the
recollection of past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives,
that is, one birth, two births … (as Sutta 4, §27) … Thus with
their aspects and particulars I recollected my manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >39.
"This was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute. But such pleasant feeling that arose
in me did not invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >40.
"When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 4, §29) … Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings pass on
according to their actions.</P>
<P  >41.
"This was the second true knowledge attained by me in the second
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
[249] darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who
abides diligent, ardent, and resolute. But such pleasant feeling that
arose in me did not invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >42.
"When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. I directly knew as it actually is: 'This is suffering';
… 'This is the origin of suffering'; … 'This is the
cessation of suffering'; … 'This is the way leading to the
cessation of suffering'; … 'These are the taints'; … 'This
is the origin of the taints'; … 'This is the cessation of the
taints'; … 'This is the way leading to the cessation of the
taints.'</P>
<P  >43.
"When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of
sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it was liberated there came the knowledge: 'It is
liberated.' I directly knew: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.'</P>
<P  >44.
"This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the third
watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose,
darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides
diligent, ardent, and resolute. But such pleasant feeling that arose
in me did not invade my mind and remain.</P>
<P  >45.
"Aggivessana, I recall teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many
hundreds. Perhaps each person thinks: 'The recluse Gotama is
teaching the Dhamma especially for me.' But it should not be so
regarded; the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma to others only to give
them knowledge. When the talk is finished, Aggivessana, then I steady
my mind internally, quieten it, bring it to singleness, and
concentrate it on that same sign of concentration as before, in which
I constantly abide."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote392anc" HREF="#sdendnote392sym"><SUP>cccxcii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"This
can be believed of Master Gotama, since he is accomplished and fully
enlightened. But does Master Gotama recall sleeping during the day?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote393anc" HREF="#sdendnote393sym"><SUP>cccxciii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >46.
"I recall, Aggivessana, in the last month of the hot season, on
returning from my almsround, after my meal I lay out my outer robe
folded in four, and lying down on my right side, I fall asleep
mindful and fully aware."</P>
<P  >"Some
recluses and brahmins call that abiding in delusion, Master Gotama."
[250]</P>
<P  >"It
is not in such a way that one is deluded or undeluded, Aggivessana.
As to how one is deluded or undeluded, listen and attend closely to
what I shall say." - "Yes, sir," Saccaka the Nigantha's son
replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >47.
"Him I call deluded, Aggivessana, who has not abandoned the taints
that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in
suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death; for it is
with the non-abandoning of the taints that one is deluded. Him I call
undeluded who has abandoned the taints that defile, bring renewal of
being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth,
ageing, and death; for it is with the abandoning of the taints that
one is undeluded. The Tathagata, Aggivessana, has abandoned the
taints that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in
suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death; he has cut
them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with
them so that they are no longer subject to future arising. Just as a
palm tree whose crown is cut off is incapable of further growth, so
too, the Tathagata has abandoned the taints that defile … done away
with them so that they are no longer subject to future arising."</P>
<P  >48.
When this was said, Saccaka the Nigantha's son said: "It is
wonderful, Master Gotama, it is marvellous how when Master Gotama is
spoken to offensively again and again, assailed by discourteous
courses of speech, the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of
his face clears, as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and
fully enlightened. I recall, Master Gotama, engaging Purana Kassapa
in debate, and then he prevaricated, led the talk aside, and showed
anger, hate, and bitterness. But when Master Gotama is spoken to
offensively again and again, assaulted by discourteous courses of
speech, the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of his face
clears, as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and fully
enlightened. I recall, Master Gotama, engaging Makkhali Gosala …
Ajita Kesakambalin … Pakudha Kaccayana … Sanjaya Belatthiputta …
the Nigantha Nataputta in debate, [251] and then he prevaricated, led
the talk aside, and showed anger, hate, and bitterness. But when
Master Gotama is spoken to offensively again and again, assailed by
discourteous courses of speech, the colour of his skin brightens and
the colour of his face clears, as is to be expected of one who is
accomplished and fully enlightened. And now, Master Gotama, we
depart. We are busy and have much to do."</P>
<P  >"Now
is the time, Aggivessana, to do as you think fit."</P>
