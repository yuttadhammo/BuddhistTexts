86. Angulimala Sutta - On Angulimala</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion there was a bandit in the realm of King Pasenadi
of Kosala named Angulimala, who was murderous, bloody-handed, given
to blows and violence, merciless to living beings. Villages, towns,
[98] and districts were laid waste by him. He was constantly
murdering people and he wore their fingers as a garland.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote820anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote820sym"><SUP>dcccxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from his almsround,
after his meal he set his resting place in order, and taking his bowl
and outer robe, set out on the road leading towards Angulimala.
Cowherds, shepherds, and ploughmen passing by saw the Blessed One
walking along the road leading towards Angulimala and told him: "Do
not take this road, recluse. On this road is the bandit Angulimala,
who is murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence,
merciless to living beings. Villages, towns, and districts have been
laid waste by him. He is constantly murdering people and he wears
their fingers as a garland. Men have come along this road in groups
of ten, twenty, thirty, and even forty, but still they have fallen
into Angulimala's hands." When this was said the Blessed One went
on in silence.</P>
<P  >For
the second time ... For the third time the cowherds, shepherds, and
ploughmen told this to the Blessed One, but still the Blessed One
went on in silence.</P>
<P  >4.
The bandit Angulimala saw the Blessed One coming in the distance.
When he saw him, he thought: "It is wonderful, it is marvellous!
Men have come along this road in groups of ten, twenty, [99] thirty,
and even forty, but still they have fallen into my hands. And now
this recluse comes alone, unaccompanied, as if driven by fate. Why
shouldn't I take this recluse's life?" Angulimala then took up
his sword and shield, buckled on his bow and quiver, and followed
close behind the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >5.
Then the Blessed One performed such a feat of supernormal power that
the bandit Angulimala, though walking as fast as he could, could not
catch up with the Blessed One, who was walking at his normal pace.
Then the bandit Angulimala thought: "It is wonderful, it is
marvellous! Formerly I could catch up even with a swift elephant and
seize it; I could catch up even with a swift horse and seize it; I
could catch up even with a swift chariot and seize it; I could catch
up even with a swift deer and seize it; but now, though I am walking
as fast as I can, I cannot catch up with this recluse who is walking
at his normal pace!" He stopped and called out to the Blessed One:
"Stop, recluse! Stop, recluse!"</P>
<P  >"I
have stopped, Angulimala, you stop too."</P>
<P  >Then
the bandit Angulimala thought: "These recluses, sons of the
Sakyans, speak truth, assert truth; but though this recluse is still
walking, he says: 'I have stopped, Angulimala, you stop too.'
Suppose I question this recluse."</P>
<P  >6.
Then the bandit Angulimala addressed the Blessed One in stanzas thus:</P>
<P >
"While you are walking, recluse, you tell me you have stopped;</P>
<P >
But now, when I have stopped, you say I have not stopped.</P>
<P >
I ask you now, O recluse, about the meaning:</P>
<P >
How is it that you have stopped and I have not?"</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
"Angulimala, I have stopped forever,</P>
<P >
I abstain from violence towards living beings;</P>
<P >
But you have no restraint towards things that live:</P>
<P >
That is why I have stopped and you have not." [100]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
"Oh, at long last this recluse, a venerated sage,</P>
<P >
Has come to this great forest for my sake.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote821anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote821sym"><SUP>dcccxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
Having heard your stanza teaching me the Dhamma,</P>
<P >
I will indeed renounce evil forever."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
So saying, the bandit took his sword and weapons</P>
<P >
And flung them in a gaping chasm's pit;</P>
<P >
The bandit worshipped the Sublime One's feet,</P>
<P >
And then and there asked for the going forth.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
The Enlightened One, the Sage of Great Compassion,</P>
<P >
The Teacher of the world with [all] its gods,</P>
<P >
Addressed him with these words, "Come, bhikkhu."</P>
<P >
And that was how he came to be a bhikkhu.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote822anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote822sym"><SUP>dcccxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >7.
Then the Blessed One set out to wander back to Savatthi with
Angulimala as his attendant. Wandering by stages, he eventually
arrived at Savatthi, and there he lived at Savatthi in Jeta's
Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >8.
Now on that occasion great crowds of people were gathering at the
gates of King Pasenadi s inner palace, very loud and noisy, crying:
"Sire, the bandit Angulimala is in your realm; he is murderous,
bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to living
beings! Villages, towns, and districts have been laid waste by him!
He is constantly murdering people and he wears their fingers as a
garland! The king must put him down!"</P>
<P  >9.
Then in the middle of the day King Pasenadi of Kosala drove out of
Savatthi with a cavalry of five hundred men and set out for the park.
He drove thus as far as the road was passable for carriages, and then
he dismounted from his carriage and went forward on foot to the
Blessed One. [101] After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat
down at one side, and the Blessed One said to him: "What is it,
great king? Is King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha attacking you, or the
Licchavis of Vesali, or other hostile kings?"</P>
<P  >10.
"Venerable sir, King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha is not attacking
me, nor are the Licchavis of Vesali, nor are other hostile kings. But
there is a bandit in my realm named Angulimala, who is murderous,
bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to living
beings. Villages, towns, and districts have been laid waste by him.
He is constantly murdering people and he wears their fingers as a
garland. I shall never be able to put him down, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >11.
"Great king, suppose you were to see that Angulimala had shaved off
his hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and gone forth from the
home life into homelessness; that he was abstaining from killing
living beings, from taking what is not given and from false speech;
that he was refraining from eating at night, ate only in one part of
the day, and was celibate, virtuous, of good character. If you were
to see him thus, how would you treat him?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, we would pay homage to him, or rise up for him, or invite him to
be seated; or we would invite him to accept robes, almsfood, a
resting place, or medicinal requisites; or we would arrange for him
lawful guarding, defence, and protection.</P>
<P  >But,
venerable sir, he is an immoral man, one of evil character. How could
he ever have such virtue and restraint?"</P>
<P  >12.
Now on that occasion the venerable Angulimala was sitting not far
from the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One extended his right arm and
said to King Pasenadi of Kosala: "Great king, this is Angulimala."</P>
<P  >Then
King Pasenadi was frightened, alarmed, and terrified. Knowing this,
the Blessed One told him: "Do not be afraid, great king, do not be
afraid. There is nothing for you to fear from him."</P>
<P  >Then
the king's fear, [102] alarm, and terror subsided. He went over to
the venerable Angulimala and said: "Venerable sir, is the noble
lord really Angulimala?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
great king."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, of what family is the noble lord's father? Of what family is
his mother?"</P>
<P  >"My
father is a Gagga, great king; my mother is a Mantani."</P>
<P  >"Let
the noble lord Gagga Mantaniputta rest content. I shall provide
robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites for the
noble lord Gagga Mantaniputta."</P>
<P  >13.
Now at that time the venerable Angulimala was a forest dweller, an
almsfood eater, a refuse-rag wearer, and restricted himself to three
robes. He replied: "Enough, great king, my triple robe is
complete."</P>
<P  >King
Pasenadi then returned to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to
him, he sat down at one side and said: "It is wonderful, venerable
sir, it is marvellous how the Blessed One tames the untamed, brings
peace to the unpeaceful, and leads to Nibbana those who have not
attained Nibbana. Venerable sir, we ourselves could not tame him with
force and weapons, yet the</P>
<P  >Blessed
One has tamed him without force or weapons. And now, venerable sir,
we depart. We are busy and have much to do."</P>
<P  >"Now
is the time, great king, to do as you think fit."</P>
<P  >Then
King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat, and after paying homage
to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.</P>
<P  >14.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Angulimala dressed, and
taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. As he
was wandering for alms from house to house in Savatthi, he saw a
certain woman giving birth to a deformed child. [103] When he saw
this, he thought: "How beings are afflicted! Indeed, how beings are
afflicted!"</P>
<P  >When
he had wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from his
almsround, after his meal he went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and said: "Venerable
sir, in the morning I dressed, and taking my bowl and outer robe,
went into Savatthi for alms. As I was wandering for alms from house
to house in Savatthi, I saw a certain woman giving birth to a
deformed child. When I saw that, I thought: 'How beings are
afflicted! Indeed, how beings are afflicted!'"</P>
<P  >15.
"In that case, Angulimala, go into Savatthi and say to that woman:
'Sister, since I was born, I do not recall that I have ever
intentionally deprived a living being of life. By this truth, may you
be well and may your infant be well!'"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, wouldn't I be telling a deliberate lie, for I have
intentionally deprived many living beings of life?"</P>
<P  >"Then,
Angulimala, go into Savatthi and say to that woman: 'Sister, since
I was born with the noble birth, I do not recall that I have ever
intentionally deprived a living being of life. By this truth, may you
be well and may your infant be well! '"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote823anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote823sym"><SUP>dcccxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," the venerable Angulimala replied, and having gone
into Savatthi, he told that woman: "Sister, since I was born with
the noble birth, I do not recall that I have ever intentionally
deprived a living being of life. By this truth, may you be well and
may your infant be well!" Then the woman and the infant became
well.</P>
<P  >16.
Before long, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and
resolute, the venerable Angulimala, by realising for himself with
direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that
supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly
go forth from the home life into homelessness. He directly knew:
"Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be
done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being."
[104] And the venerable Angulimala became one of the arahants.</P>
<P  >17.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Angulimala dressed, and
taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. Now on
that occasion someone threw a clod and hit the venerable Angulimala's
body, someone else threw a stick and hit his body, and someone else
threw a potsherd and hit his body. Then, with blood running from his
cut head, with his bowl broken, and with his outer robe torn, the
venerable Angulimala went to the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw him
coming in the distance and told him: "Bear it, brahmin! Bear it,
brahmin! You are experiencing here and now the result of deeds
because of which you might have been tortured in hell for many years,
for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote824anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote824sym"><SUP>dcccxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >18.
Then, while the venerable Angulimala was alone in retreat
experiencing the bliss of deliverance, he uttered this exclamation:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote825anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote825sym"><SUP>dcccxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
"Who once did live in negligence</P>
<P >
And then is negligent no more,</P>
<P >
He illuminates the world</P>
<P >
Like the moon freed from a cloud.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Who checks the evil deeds he did</P>
<P >
By doing wholesome deeds instead,</P>
<P >
He illuminates the world</P>
<P >
Like the moon freed from a cloud.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
The youthful bhikkhu who devotes</P>
<P >
His efforts to the Buddha's teaching,</P>
<P >
He illuminates the world</P>
<P >
Like the moon freed from a cloud.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Let my enemies hear discourse on the Dhamma,</P>
<P >
Let them be devoted to the Buddha's teaching,</P>
<P >
Let my enemies wait on those good people</P>
<P >
Who lead others to accept the Dhamma.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
[105] Let my enemies give ear from time to time</P>
<P >
And hear the Dhamma of those who preach forbearance,</P>
<P >
Of those who speak as well in praise of kindness,</P>
<P >
And let them follow up that Dhamma with kind deeds.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
For surely then they would not wish to harm me,</P>
<P >
Nor would they think of harming other beings,</P>
<P >
So those who would protect all, frail or strong,</P>
<P >
Let them attain the all-surpassing peace.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Conduit-makers guide the water,</P>
<P >
Fletchers straighten out the arrow-shaft,</P>
<P >
Carpenters straighten out the timber,</P>
<P >
But wise men seek to tame themselves.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
There are some that tame with beatings,</P>
<P >
Some with goads and some with whips;</P>
<P >
But I was tamed by such alone</P>
<P >
Who has no rod nor any weapon.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
'Harmless' is the name I bear,</P>
<P >
Though I was dangerous in the past.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote826anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote826sym"><SUP>dcccxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
The name I bear today is true:</P>
<P >
I hurt no living being at all.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
And though I once lived as a bandit</P>
<P >
With the name of 'Finger-garland,'</P>
<P >
One whom the great flood swept along,</P>
<P >
I went for refuge to the Buddha.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
And though I once was bloody-handed</P>
<P >
With the name of 'Finger-garland,'</P>
<P >
See the refuge I have found:</P>
<P >
The bond of being has been cut.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
While I did many deeds that lead</P>
<P >
To rebirth in the evil realms,</P>
<P >
Yet their result has reached me now,</P>
<P >
And so I eat free from debt.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote827anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote827sym"><SUP>dcccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
They are fools and have no sense</P>
<P >
Who give themselves to negligence,</P>
<P >
But those of wisdom guard diligence</P>
<P >
And treat it as their greatest good.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Do not give way to negligence</P>
<P >
Nor seek delight in sensual pleasures,</P>
<P >
But meditate with diligence</P>
<P >
So as to reach the perfect bliss.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
So welcome to that choice of mine</P>
<P >
And let it stand, it was not ill made;</P>
<P >
Of all the Dhammas known to men</P>
<P >
I have come to the very best.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
So welcome to that choice of mine</P>
<P >
And let it stand, it was not ill made;</P>
<P >
I have attained the triple knowledge</P>
<P >
And done all that the Buddha teaches."</P>
