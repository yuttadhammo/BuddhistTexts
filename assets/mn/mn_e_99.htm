99. Subha Sutta - To Subha</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya's son, was
staying at the residence of a certain householder in Savatthi for
some business or other.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote908anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote908sym"><SUP>cmviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya's son, asked the
householder in whose residence he was staying: "Householder, I have
heard that Savatthi is not devoid of arahants. What recluse or
brahmin may we go to today to pay our respects?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, this Blessed One is living at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove,
Anathapindika's Park. You may go to pay your respects to that
Blessed One, venerable sir." [197]</P>
<P  >3.
Then, having assented to the householder, the brahmin student Subha,
Todeyya's son, went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with
him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down
at one side and asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >4.
"Master Gotama, the brahmins say this: 'The householder is
accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome. The one
gone forth [into homelessness] is not accomplishing the true way, the
Dhamma that is wholesome.' What does Master Gotama say about this?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
student, I am one who speaks after making an analysis;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote909anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote909sym"><SUP>cmix</SUP></A></SUP>
I do not speak one-sidedly. I do not praise the wrong way of practice
on the part either of a householder or one gone forth; for whether it
be a householder or one gone forth, one who has entered on the wrong
way of practice, by reason of his wrong way of practice, is not
accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma that is wholesome. I praise
the right way of practice on the part either of a householder or one
gone forth; for whether it be a householder or one gone forth, one
who has entered on the right way of practice, by reason of his right
way of practice, is accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma that is
wholesome."</P>
<P  >5.
"Master Gotama, the brahmins say this: 'Since the work of the
household life involves a great deal of activity, great functions,
great engagements, and great undertakings, it is of great fruit.
Since the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of
activity, small functions, small engagements, and small undertakings,
it is of small fruit.' What does Master Gotama say about this?"</P>
<P  >"Here
too, student, I am one who speaks after making an analysis; I do not
speak one-sidedly. There is work involving a great deal of activity,
great functions, great engagements, and great undertakings, which,
when it fails, is of small fruit. There is work involving a great
deal of activity, great functions, great engagements, and great
undertakings, which, when it succeeds, is of great fruit. There is
work involving a small amount of activity, small functions, small
engagements, and small undertakings, which, when it fails, is of
small fruit. There is work involving a small amount of activity,
small functions, small engagements, and small undertakings, which,
when it succeeds, is of great fruit.</P>
<P  >6.
"What, [198] student, is that work involving a great deal of
activity ... which, when it fails, is of small fruit? Agriculture is
that work involving a great deal of activity ... which, when it
fails, is of small fruit. And what, student, is that work involving a
great deal of activity ... which, when it succeeds, is of great
fruit? Agriculture again is that work involving a great deal of
activity ... which, when it succeeds, is of great fruit. And what,
student, is that work involving a small amount of activity ... which,
when it fails, is of small fruit? Trade is that work involving a
small amount of activity ... which, when it fails, is of small
fruit.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote910anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote910sym"><SUP>cmx</SUP></A></SUP>
And what, student, is that work involving a small amount of activity
... which, when it succeeds, is of great fruit? Trade again is that
work involving a small amount of activity ... which, when it
succeeds, is of great fruit.</P>
<P  >7.
"Just as agriculture, student, is work that involves a great deal
of activity ... but is of small fruit when it fails, so the work of
the household life involves a great deal of activity, great
functions, great engagements, and great undertakings, but is of small
fruit when it fails. Just as agriculture is work that involves a
great deal of activity ... and is of great fruit when it succeeds, so
the work of the household life involves a great deal of activity,
great functions, great engagements, and great undertakings, and is of
great fruit when it succeeds. Just as trade is work that involves a
small amount of activity ... and is of small fruit when it fails, so
the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of activity,
small functions, small engagements, and small undertakings, and is of
small fruit when it fails. Just as trade is work that involves a
small amount of activity ... but is of great fruit when it succeeds,
so [199] the work of those gone forth involves a small amount of
activity, small functions, small engagements, and small undertakings,
but is of great fruit when it succeeds."</P>
<P  >8.
"Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe five things for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome."</P>
<P  >"If
it is not troublesome for you, student, please state to this assembly
the five things that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of
merit, for accomplishing the wholesome."</P>
<P  >"It
is not troublesome for me, Master Gotama, when such venerable ones as
yourself and others are sitting [in the assembly]." "Then state
them, student."</P>
<P  >9.
"Master Gotama, truth is the first thing that the brahmins
prescribe for the performance of merit, for accomplishing the
wholesome. Asceticism is the second thing ... Celibacy is the third
thing ... Study is the fourth thing ... Generosity is the fifth thing
that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit, for
accomplishing the wholesome. These are the five things that the
brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit, for accomplishing
the wholesome. What does Master Gotama say about this?"</P>
<P  >"How
then, student,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote911anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote911sym"><SUP>cmxi</SUP></A></SUP>
among the brahmins is there even a single brahmin who says thus: 'I
declare the result of these five things having realised it myself
with direct knowledge'?" - "No, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"How
then, student, among the brahmins is there even a single teacher or
teacher's teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers who
says thus: 'I declare the result of these five things having
realised it myself with direct knowledge'?" - "No, Master
Gotama." [200]</P>
<P  >"How
then, student, the ancient brahmin seers, the creators of the hymns,
the composers of the hymns, whose ancient hymns</P>
<P  >that
were formerly chanted, uttered, and compiled the brahmins nowadays
still chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken, reciting what was
recited - that is, Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi,
Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu - did even these
ancient brahmin seers say thus: 'We declare the result of these
five things having realised it ourselves with direct knowledge'?"
- "No, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"So,
student, it seems that among the brahmins there is not even a single
brahmin who says thus: 'I declare the result of these five things
having realised it myself with direct knowledge.' And among the
brahmins there is not even a single teacher or a single teacher's
teacher back to the seventh generation of teachers, who says thus: 'I
declare the result of these five things having realised it myself
with direct knowledge.' And the ancient brahmin seers, the creators
of the hymns, the composers of the hymns ... even these ancient
brahmin seers did not say thus: 'We declare the result of these
five things having realised it ourselves with direct knowledge.'
Suppose there were a file of blind men each in touch with the next:
the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last
one does not see. So too, student, in regard to their statement the
brahmins seem to be like a file of blind men: the first one does not
see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see."</P>
<P  >10.
When this was said, the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya's son, was
angry and displeased with the simile of the file of blind men, and he
reviled, disparaged, and censured the Blessed One, saying: "The
recluse Gotama will be worsted." Then he said to the Blessed One:
"Master Gotama, the brahrnin Pokkharasati of the Upamanna clan,
lord of the Subhaga Grove, says thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote912anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote912sym"><SUP>cmxii</SUP></A></SUP>
'Some recluses and brahmins here claim superhuman states,
distinctions in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. But
what they say [201] turns out to be ridiculous; it turns out to be
mere words, empty and hollow. For how could a human being know or see
or realise a superhuman state, a distinction in knowledge and vision
worthy of the noble ones? That is impossible.'"</P>
<P  >11.
"How then, student, does the brahmin Pokkharasati understand the
minds of all recluses and brahmins, having encompassed them with his
own mind?"</P>
<P  >"Master
Gotama, the brahmin Pokkharasati does not even understand the mind of
his slavewoman Punnika, having encompassed it with his own mind, so
how could he understand thus the minds of all recluses and brahmins?"</P>
<P  >12.
"Student, suppose there were a man born blind who could not see
dark and light forms, who could not see blue, yellow, red, or pink
forms, who could not see what was even and uneven, who could not see
the stars or the sun and moon. He might say thus: 'There are no
dark and light forms, and no one who sees dark and light forms; there
are no blue, yellow, red, or pink forms, and no one who sees blue,
yellow, red, or pink forms; there is nothing even and uneven, and no
one who sees anything even and uneven; there are no stars and no sun
and moon, and no one who sees stars and the sun and moon. I do not
know these, I do not see these, therefore these do not exist.'
Speaking thus, student, would he be speaking rightly?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. There are dark and light forms, and those who see dark
and light forms ... there are the stars and the sun and moon, and
those who see the stars and the sun and moon. [202] Saying, 'I do
not know these, I do not see these, therefore these do not exist,'
he would not be speaking rightly."</P>
<P  >13.
"So too, student, the brahmin Pokkharasati is blind and visionless.
That he could know or see or realise a superhuman state, a
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones - this
is impossible. What do you think, student? What is better for those
well-to-do brahmins of Kosala such as the brahmin Canki, the brahmin
Tarukkha, the brahmin Pokkharasati, the brahmin Janussoni, or your
father, the brahmin Todeyya - that the statements they make accord
with worldly convention or flaunt worldly convention?" - "That
they accord with worldly convention, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"What
is better for them, that the statements they make be thoughtful or
thoughtless?" - "Thoughtful, Master Gotama." - "What is
better for them, that they make their statements after reflecting or
without reflecting?" - "After reflecting, Master Gotama." -
"What is better for them, that the statements they make be
beneficial or unbeneficial?" - "Beneficial, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >14.
"What do you think, student? If that is so, did the statement made
by the brahmin Pokkharasati accord with worldly convention or flaunt
worldly convention?" - "It flaunted worldly convention, Master
Gotama." - "Was the statement</P>
<P  >made
thoughtful or thoughtless?" - "Thoughtless, Master Gotama." -
"Was the statement made after reflecting or without reflecting?"
- "Without reflecting, Master Gotama." - "Was the statement
made beneficial or unbeneficial?" - "Unbeneficial, Master
Gotama." [203]</P>
<P  >15.
"Now there are these five hindrances, student. What are the five?
The hindrance of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, the
hindrance of sloth and torpor, the hindrance of restlessness and
remorse, and the hindrance of doubt. These are the five hindrances.
The brahmin Pokkharasati is obstructed, hindered, blocked, and
enveloped by these five hindrances. That he could know or see or
realise a superhuman state, a distinction in knowledge and vision
worthy of the noble ones - this is impossible.</P>
<P  >16.
"Now there are these five cords of sensual pleasure, student. What
are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear ... Odours
cognizable by the nose ... Flavours cognizable by the tongue ...
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.
The brahmin Pokkharasati is tied to these five cords of sensual
pleasure, infatuated with them and utterly committed to them; he
enjoys them without seeing the danger in them or understanding the
escape from them. That he could know or see or realise a superhuman
state, a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones
- this is impossible.</P>
<P  >17.
"What do you think, student? Which of these two fires would have a
[better] flame, colour, and radiance - a fire that might burn in
dependence on fuel, such as grass and wood, or a fire that might bum
independent of fuel, such as grass and wood?"</P>
<P  >"If
it were possible, Master Gotama, for a fire to burn independent of
fuel such as grass and wood, that fire would have a [better] flame,
colour, and radiance."</P>
<P  >"It
is impossible, student, it cannot happen that a fire could burn
independent of fuel such as grass or wood except through [the
exercise of] supernormal power. Like the fire that burns dependent on
fuel such as grass and wood, I say, is the rapture [204] that is
dependent on the five cords of sensual pleasure. Like the fire that
burns independent of fuel such as grass and</P>
<P  >wood,
I say, is the rapture that is apart from sensual pleasures, apart
from unwholesome states. And what, student, is the rapture that is
apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states? Here,
quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion. This is a rapture apart from sensual
pleasures, apart from unwholesome states. Again, with the stilling of
applied and sustained thought, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in
the second jhana, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind
without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born
of concentration. This too is a rapture apart from sensual pleasures,
apart from unwholesome states.</P>
<P  >18.
"Of those five things, student, that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, which of the
five do they prescribe as the most fruitful for the performance of
merit, for accomplishing the wholesome?"</P>
<P  >"Of
those five things, Master Gotama, that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, they prescribe
generosity as the most fruitful for the performance of merit, for
accomplishing the wholesome."</P>
<P  >19.
"What do you think, student? Here a brahmin might be holding a
great sacrifice, and two other brahmins would go there thinking to
take part in that great sacrifice. One brahmin among them would
think: 'Oh, that only I might get the best seat, the best water,
the best almsfood in the refectory; that no other brahmin might get
the best seat, the best water, the best almsfood in the refectory!'
And it is possible that the other brahmin, not that brahmin, gets the
best seat, the best water, the best almsfood in the refectory.
Thinking about this, [205] the first brahmin might become angry and
displeased. What kind of result do the brahmins describe for this?"</P>
<P  >"Master
Gotama, brahmins do not give gifts in such a way, thinking: 'Let
the others become angry and displeased because of this.' Rather,
brahmins give gifts motivated by compassion."</P>
<P  >"That
being so, student, isn't this the brahmins' sixth basis for the
performance of merit, that is, the motive of compassion?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote913anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote913sym"><SUP>cmxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"That
being so, Master Gotama, this is the brahmins' sixth basis for the
performance of merit, that is, the motive of compassion."</P>
<P  >20.
"Those five things, student, that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome - where do you
often see those five things, among householders or among those gone
forth?"</P>
<P  >"Those
five things, Master Gotama, that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, I often see
among those gone forth, seldom among householders. For the
householder has a great deal of activity, great functions, great
engagements, and great undertakings: he does not constantly and
invariably speak the truth, practise asceticism, observe celibacy,
engage in study, or engage in generosity. But one gone forth has a
small amount of activity, small functions, small engagements, and
small undertakings: he constantly and invariably speaks the truth,
practises asceticism, observes celibacy, engages in study, and
engages in generosity. Thus those five things that the brahmins
prescribe for the performance of merit, for accomplishing the
wholesome, I often see among those gone forth, seldom among
householders."</P>
<P  >21.
"Those five things, student, that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, [206] 1 call
equipment of the mind, that is, for developing a mind that is without
hostility and without ill will. Here, student, a bhikkhu is a speaker
of truth. Thinking, 'I am a speaker of truth,' he gains
inspiration in the meaning, gains <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://inspiration.in/">inspiration.
in</A></U></FONT> the Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the
Dhamma. It is that gladness connected with the wholesome that I call
an equipment of the mind. Here, student, a bhikkhu is an ascetic ...
one who is celibate ... one who engages in study ... one who engages
in generosity. Thinking, 'I am one who engages in generosity,' he
gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma,
gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. It is that gladness
connected with the wholesome that I call an equipment of the mind.
Thus those five things that the brahmins prescribe for the
performance of merit, for accomplishing the wholesome, I call
equipment of the mind, that is, for developing a mind that is without
hostility and without ill will."</P>
<P  >22.
When this was said, the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya's son, said
to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, I have heard that the recluse
Gotama knows the path to the company of Brahma."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, student? Is the village of Nalakara near here, not far
from here?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir, the village of Nalakara is near here, not far from here."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, student? Suppose there was a man born and raised in the
village of Nalakara, and as soon as he had left Nalakara they asked
him about the path to the village. Would that man be slow or hesitant
in answering?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Why is that? Because that man has been born and raised
in Nalakara, and is well-acquainted with all the paths to the
village."</P>
<P  >"Still,
a man born and raised in the village of Nalakara [207] might be slow
or hesitant in answering when asked about the path to the village,
but a Tathagata, when asked about the Brahma-world or the way leading
to the Brahma-world, would never be slow or hesitant in answering. I
understand Brahma, student, and I understand the Brahma-world, and I
understand the way leading to the Brahma-world, and I understand how
one should practise to reappear in the Brahma-world."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote914anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote914sym"><SUP>cmxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
"Master Gotama, I have heard that the recluse Gotama teaches the
path to the company of Brahma. It would be good if Master Gotama
would teach me the path to the company of Brahma."</P>
<P  >"Then,
student, listen and attend closely to what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," he replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >24.
"What, student, is the path to the company of Brahma? Here a
bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise
the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to
himself, he abides pervading the allencompassing world with a mind
imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility, and without ill will. When the deliverance of mind by
loving-kindness is developed in this way, no limiting action remains
there, none persists there. Just as a vigorous trumpeter could make
himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters, so too, when
the deliverance of mind by loving-kindness is developed in this way,
no limiting action remains there, none persists there.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote915anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote915sym"><SUP>cmxv</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the path to the company of Brahma.</P>
<P  >25-27.
"Again, a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with compassion ... with a mind imbued with appreciative joy ... with
a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the
third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere,
and to all as to himself, he abides pervading the all-encompassing
world with a mind imbued with equanimity, abundant, exalted, [208]
immeasurable, without hostility, and without ill will. When the
deliverance of mind by equanimity is developed in this way, no
limiting action remains there, none persists there. Just as a
vigorous trumpeter could make himself heard without difficulty in the
four quarters, so too, when the deliverance of mind by equanimity is
developed in this way, no limiting action remains there, none
persists there. This too is the path to the company of Brahma."</P>
<P  >28.
When this was said, the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya's son, said
to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent,
Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways,
as though he were turning upright what had been overturned, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a
lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master
Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus.
Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
for refuge for life.</P>
<P  >29.
"And now, Master Gotama, we depart. We are busy and have much to
do."</P>
<P  >"Now
is the time, student, to do as you think fit."</P>
<P  >Then
the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya's son, having delighted and
rejoiced in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after
paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he
departed.</P>
<P  >30.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Janussoni was driving out of
Savatthi in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by
white mares.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote916anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote916sym"><SUP>cmxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
He saw the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya's son, coming in the
distance and asked him: "Now where is Master Bharadvaja coming from
in the middle of the day?"</P>
<P  >"Sir,
I am coming from the presence of the recluse Gotama."</P>
<P  >"What
does Master Bharadvaja think of the recluse Gotama's lucidity of
wisdom? He is wise, is he not?" [209]</P>
<P  >"Sir,
who am I to know the recluse Gotama's lucidity of wisdom? One would
surely have to be his equal to know the recluse Gotama's lucidity
of wisdom."</P>
<P  >"Master
Bharadvaja praises the recluse Gotama with high praise indeed."</P>
<P  >"Sir,
who am I to praise the recluse Gotama? The recluse Gotama is praised
by the praised as best among gods and humans. Sir, those five things
that the brahmins prescribe for the performance of merit, for
accomplishing the wholesome, the recluse Gotama calls equipment of
the mind, that is, for developing a mind that is without hostility
and without ill will."</P>
<P  >31.
When this was said, the brahmin Janussoni got down from his all-white
chariot drawn by white mares, and after arranging his upper robe on
one shoulder, he extended his hands in reverential salutation towards
the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation: "It is a gain for
King Pasenadi of Kosala, it is a great gain for King Pasenadi of
Kosala that the Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened, lives
in his realm."</P>
