149. Mahasalayatanika Sutta - The Great Sixfold Base</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on the great sixfold base.
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." - "Yes, venerable
sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
"Bhikkhus, when one does not know and see the eye as it actually
is,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1338anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1338sym"><SUP>mcccxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
when one does not know and see forms as they actually are, when one
does not know and see eye-consciousness as it actually is, when one
does not know and see eye-contact as it actually is, when one does
not know and see as it actually is [the feeling] felt as pleasant or
painful or neither-painful-norpleasant that arises with eye-contact
as condition, then one is inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms,
for eye-consciousness, for eye-contact, for [the feeling] felt as
pleasant or painful or neitherpainful-nor-pleasant that arises with
eye-contact as condition.</P>
<P  >"When
one abides inflamed by lust, fettered, infatuated, contemplating
gratification, then the five aggregates affected by clinging are
built up for oneself in the future;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1339anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1339sym"><SUP>mcccxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
and one's craving - which brings renewal of being, is accompanied
by delight and lust, and delights in this and that - increases. One's
bodily and [288] mental troubles increase, one's bodily and mental
torments increase, one's bodily and mental fevers increase, and one
experiences bodily and mental suffering.</P>
<P  >4-8.
"When one does not know and see the ear as it actually is ... When
one does not know and see the nose as it actually is ... When one
does not know and see the tongue as it actually is ... When one does
not know and see the body as it actually is ... When one does not
know and see the mind as it actually is ... one experiences bodily
and mental suffering.</P>
<P  >9.
"Bhikkhus, when one knows and sees the eye as it actually is,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1340anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1340sym"><SUP>mcccxl</SUP></A></SUP>
when one knows and sees forms as they actually are, when one knows
and sees eye-consciousness as it actually is, when one knows and sees
eye-contact as it actually is, when one knows and sees as it actually
is [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or
neither-painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as
condition, then one is not inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms,
for eye-consciousness, for eye-contact, for [the feeling] felt as
pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant that arises with
eye-contact as condition.</P>
<P  >"When
one abides uninflamed by lust, unfettered, uninfatuated,
contemplating danger, then the five aggregates affected by clinging
are diminished for oneself in the future; and one's craving - which
brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and
delights in this or that - is abandoned. One's bodily and mental
troubles are abandoned, one's bodily and mental torments are
abandoned, one's bodily and mental fevers are abandoned, [289] and
one experiences bodily and mental pleasure.</P>
<P  >10.
"The view of a person such as this is right view. His intention is
right intention, his effort is right effort, his mindfulness is right
mindfulness, his concentration is right concentration. But his bodily
action, his verbal action, and his livelihood have already been well
purified earlier.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1341anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1341sym"><SUP>mcccxli</SUP></A></SUP>
Thus this Noble Eightfold Path comes to fulfilment in him by
development. When he develops this Noble Eightfold Path, the four
foundations of mindfulness also come to fulfilment in him by
development; the four right kinds of striving also come to fulfilment
in him by development; the four bases for spiritual power also come
to fulfilment in him by development; the five faculties also come to
fulfilment in him by development; the five powers also come to
fulfilment in him by development; the seven enlightenment factors
also come to fulfilment in him by development. These two things -
serenity and insight - occur in him yoked evenly together.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1342anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1342sym"><SUP>mcccxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
He fully understands by direct knowledge those things that should be
fully understood by direct knowledge. He abandons by direct knowledge
those things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge. He
develops by direct knowledge those things that should be developed by
direct knowledge. He realises by direct knowledge those things that
should be realised by direct knowledge.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1343anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1343sym"><SUP>mcccxliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
"And what things should be fully understood by direct knowledge?
The answer to that is: the five aggregates affected by clinging, that
is, the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling
aggregate affected by clinging, the perception aggregate affected by
clinging, the formations aggregate affected by clinging, the
consciousness aggregate affected by clinging. These are the things
that should be fully understood by direct knowledge.</P>
<P  >"And
what things should be abandoned by direct knowledge? Ignorance and
craving for being. These are the things that should be abandoned by
direct knowledge.</P>
<P  >"And
what things should be developed by direct knowledge? Serenity and
insight.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1344anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1344sym"><SUP>mcccxliv</SUP></A></SUP>
These are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge.
[290]</P>
<P  >"And
what things should be realised by direct knowledge? True knowledge
and deliverance.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1345anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1345sym"><SUP>mcccxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
These are the things that should be realised by direct knowledge.</P>
<P  >12-14.
"When one knows and sees the ear as it actually is ... These are
the things that should be realised by direct knowledge.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1346anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1346sym"><SUP>mcccxlvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15-17.
"When one knows and sees the nose as it actually is ... These are
the things that should be realised by direct knowledge.</P>
<P  >18-20.
"When one knows and sees the tongue as it actually is ... These are
the things that should be realised by direct knowledge.</P>
<P  >21-23.
"When one knows and sees the body as it actually is ... These are
the things that should be realised by direct knowledge.</P>
<P  >24-26.
"When one knows and sees the mind as it actually is ... These are
the things that should be realised by direct knowledge."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
