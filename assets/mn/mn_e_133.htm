133. Mahakaccanabhaddekaratta Sutta - Maha Kaccana<BR>and One
Fortunate Attachment</H2>
<P  >[192]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Park of the Hot Springs. Then., when it was near
dawn, the venerable Samiddhi went to the hot springs to bathe his
limbs. After bathing he came up out of the water and stood dressed in
one robe, drying his limbs. Then, when the night was well advanced, a
certain deity of beautiful appearance who illuminated the whole of
the Hot Springs, approached the venerable Samiddhi. Standing at one
side, the deity said to him:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhu, do you remember the summary and exposition of 'One Who
Has One Fortunate Attachment'?"</P>
<P  >"Friend,
I do not remember the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One
Fortunate Attachment.' But, friend, do you remember the summary and
exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment'?"</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
I too do not remember the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has
One Fortunate Attachment.' But, bhikkhu, do you remember the stanza
of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment'?"</P>
<P  >"Friend,
I do not remember the stanza of 'One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment.' But, friend, do you remember the stanza of 'One Who
Has One Fortunate Attachment'?"</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
I too do not remember the stanza of 'One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment.' But, bhikkhu, learn the summary and exposition of 'One
Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.' Bhikkhu, master the summary and
exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.' Bhikkhu,
remember the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment.'</P>
<P  >Bhikkhu,
the summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate
Attachment' is beneficial, it belongs to the fundamentals of the
holy life."</P>
<P  >That
is what was said by the deity, who thereupon vanished at once.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when the night was over, the venerable Samiddhi went to the
Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side,
[193] told the Blessed One all that had occurred, and said: "It
would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me the
summary and exposition of 'One Who Has One Fortunate Attachment.'"</P>
<P  >4.
"Then, bhikkhu, listen and attend closely to what I shall say." -
"Yes, venerable sir," the venerable Samiddhi replied. The Blessed
One said:</P>
<P  >5.
Let not a person revive the past</P>
<P >
Or on the future build his hopes;</P>
<P >
For the past has been left behind</P>
<P >
And the future has not been reached.</P>
<P >
Instead with insight let him see</P>
<P >
Each presently arisen state;</P>
<P >
Let him know that and be sure of it,</P>
<P >
Invincibly, unshakeably.</P>
<P >
Today the effort must be made;</P>
<P >
Tomorrow Death may come, who knows?</P>
<P >
No bargain with Mortality</P>
<P >
Can keep him and his hordes away.</P>
<P >
But one who dwells thus ardently,</P>
<P >
Relentlessly, by day, by night –</P>
<P >
It is he, the Peaceful Sage has said,</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment."</P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >6.
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One
rose from his seat and went into his dwelling.</P>
<P  >7.
Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the bhikkhus considered:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1219anc" HREF="#sdendnote1219sym"><SUP>mccxix</SUP></A></SUP>
"Now, friends, the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone
into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding
the detailed meaning. Now who will expound this in detail?" [194]
Then they considered: "The venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the
Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life. He is
capable of expounding the detailed meaning. Suppose we went to him
and asked him the meaning of this."</P>
<P  >8.
Then the bhikkhus went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, they sat down to one side and they told him what had taken
place, adding: "Let the venerable Maha Kaccana expound it to us."</P>
<P  >9.
[The venerable Maha Kaccana replied:] "Friends, it is as though a
man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, [195] thought that heartwood should be sought for among
the branches and leaves of a great tree standing possessed of
heartwood, after he had passed over the root and the trunk. And so it
is with you, venerable sirs, that you think that I should be asked
about the meaning of this, after you passed the Blessed One by when
you were face to face with the Teacher. For knowing, the Blessed One
knows; seeing, he sees; he is vision, he is knowledge, he is the
Dhamma, he is the holy one; he is the sayer, the proclaimer, the
elucidator of meaning, the giver of the Deathless, the lord of the
Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the time when you should have asked
the Blessed One the meaning. As he told you, so you should have
remembered it."</P>
<P  >10.
"Surely, friend Kaccana, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he
sees; he is vision … the Tathagata. That was the time when we
should have asked the Blessed One the meaning. As he told us, so we
should have remembered it. Yet the venerable Maha Kaccana is praised
by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life.
The venerable Maha Kaccana is capable of expounding the detailed
meaning of this summary given in brief by the Blessed One without
expounding the detailed meaning. Let the venerable Maha Kaccana
expound it without finding it troublesome."</P>
<P  >11.
"Then listen, friends, and attend closely to what I shall say." -
"Yes, friend," the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Maha Kaccana
said this:</P>
<P  >12.
"Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his
dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the
detailed meaning, that is:</P>
<P >
'Let not a person revive the past …</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment,'</P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >I
understand the detailed meaning of it to be as follows.</P>
<P  >13.
"How, friends, does one revive the past? [196] Thinking, 'My eye
was thus in the past and forms were thus,'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1220anc" HREF="#sdendnote1220sym"><SUP>mccxx</SUP></A></SUP>
one's consciousness becomes bound up with desire and lust for that.
Because one's consciousness is bound up with desire and lust, one
delights in that. When one delights in that, one revives the past.</P>
<P  >"Thinking,
'My ear was thus in the past and sounds were thus … My nose and
odours … My tongue and flavours … My body and tangibles … My
mind was thus in the past and mindobjects were thus,' one's
consciousness becomes bound up with desire and lust for that. Because
one's consciousness is bound up with desire and lust, one delights
in that. When one delights in that, one revives the past. That is how
one revives the past.</P>
<P  >14.
"How does one not revive the past? Thinking, 'My eye was thus in
the past and forms were thus,' one's consciousness does not
become bound up with desire and lust for that. Because one's
consciousness is not bound up with desire and lust, one does not
delight in that. When one does not delight in that, one does not
revive the past.</P>
<P  >"Thinking,
'My ear was thus in the past and sounds were thus … My nose and
odours … My tongue and flavours … My body and tangibles … My
mind was thus in the past and mindobjects were thus,' one's
consciousness does not become bound up with desire and lust for that.
Because one's consciousness is not bound up with desire and lust,
one does not delight in that. When one does not delight in that, one
does not revive the past. That is how one does not revive the past.</P>
<P  >15.
"How, friends, does one build up hope upon the future? Thinking,
'My eye may be thus in the future and forms may be thus,' one
sets one's heart on obtaining what has not yet been obtained.
Because one sets one's heart thus, one delights in that. When one
delights in that, one builds up hope upon the future.</P>
<P  >"Thinking,
'My ear may be thus in the future and sounds may be thus … My
nose and odours … My tongue and flavours … My body and tangibles
… My mind may be thus in the future and [197] mind-objects may be
thus,' one sets one's heart on obtaining what has not yet been
obtained. Because one sets one's heart thus, one delights in that.
When one delights in that, one builds up hope upon the future. That
is how one builds up hope upon the future.</P>
<P  >16.
"How, friends, does one not build up hope upon the future?
Thinking, 'My eye may be thus in the future and forms may be thus,'
one does not set one's heart on obtaining what has not yet been
obtained. Because one does not set one's heart thus, one does not
delight in that. When one does not delight in that, one does not
build up hope upon the future.</P>
<P  >"Thinking,
'My ear may be thus in the future and sounds may be thus … My
nose and odours … My tongue and flavours … My body and tangibles
… My mind may be thus in the future and mind-objects may be thus,'
one does not set one's heart on obtaining what has not yet been
obtained. Because one does not set one's heart thus, one does not
delight in that. When one does not delight in that, one does not
build up hope upon the future. That is how one does not build up hope
upon the future.</P>
<P  >17.
"How is one vanquished in regard to presently arisen states? In
regard to the eye and forms that are presently arisen, one's
consciousness is bound up with desire and lust for that which is
presently arisen. Because one's consciousness is bound up with
desire and lust, one delights in that. When one delights in that, one
is vanquished in regard to presently arisen states.</P>
<P  >"In
regard to the ear and sounds that are presently arisen … the nose
and odours … the tongue and flavours … the body and tangibles …
the mind and mind-objects that are presently arisen, one's
consciousness is bound up with desire and lust for that which is
presently arisen. Because one's consciousness is bound up with
desire and lust, one delights in that. When one delights in that, one
is vanquished in regard to presently arisen states. That is how one
is vanquished in regard to presently arisen states.</P>
<P  >18.
"How is one invincible in regard to presently arisen states? In
regard to the eye and forms that are presently arisen, one's
consciousness is not bound up with desire and lust for that which is
presently arisen. Because one's consciousness is not bound up with
desire and lust, one does not delight in that. When one does not
delight in that, one is invincible in regard to presently arisen
states.</P>
<P  >"In
regard to the ear and sounds that are presently arisen .. the nose
and odours … the tongue and flavours … the body and tangibles …
the mind and mind-objects that are presently arisen, [198] one's
consciousness is not bound up with desire and lust for that which is
presently arisen. Because one's consciousness is not bound up with
desire and lust, one does not delight in that. When one does not
delight in that, one is invincible in regard to presently arisen
states. That is how one is invincible in regard to presently arisen
states.</P>
<P  >19.
"Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his
dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the
detailed meaning, that is:</P>
<P >
'Let not a person revive the past …</P>
<P >
Who has one fortunate attachment,'</P>
<P  ><BR>
</P>
<P  >I
understand the detailed meaning of this summary to be thus. Now,
friends, if you wish, go to the Blessed One and ask him about the
meaning of this. As the Blessed One explains it to you, so you should
remember it."</P>
<P  >20.
Then the bhikkhus, having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable
Maha Kaccana's words, rose from their seats and went to the Blessed
One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told
the Blessed One all that had taken place after he had left, adding:
[199] "Then, venerable sir, we went to the venerable Maha Kaccana
and asked him about the meaning. The venerable Maha Kaccana expounded
the meaning to us with these terms, statements, and phrases."</P>
<P  >21.
"Maha Kaccana is wise, bhikkhus, Maha Kaccana has great wisdom. If
you had asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to
you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained it. Such is its
meaning, and so you should remember it."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
