87. Piyajatika Sutta - Born from Those Who Are Dear</H2>
<P  >[106]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapinclika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a certain householder's dear and beloved only
son had died. After his son's death, he had no more desire to work
or to eat. He kept going to the charnel ground and crying: "My only
child, where are you? My only child, where are you?"</P>
<P  >3.
Then that householder went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One said to him:
"Householder, your faculties are not those of one in control of his
own mind. Your faculties are deranged."</P>
<P  >"How
could my faculties not be deranged, venerable sir? For my dear and
beloved only son has died. Since he died I have no more desire to
work or to eat. I keep going to the charnel ground and crying: 'My
only child, where are you? My only child, where are you?'"</P>
<P  >"So
it is, householder, so it is! Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are
dear."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, who would ever think that sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are
dear? Venerable sir, happiness and joy are born from those who are
dear, arise from those who are dear." Then, displeased with the
Blessed One's words, disapproving of them, the householder rose
from his seat and left.</P>
<P  >4.
Now on that occasion some gamblers were playing with dice not far
from the Blessed One. Then the householder went to those gamblers and
said: "Just now, sirs, [107] I went to the recluse Gotama, and
after paying homage to him, I sat down at one side. When I had done
so, the recluse Gotama said to me:</P>
<P  >'Householder,
your faculties are not those of one in control of his own mind.' ...
(repeat the entire conversation as above) ... 'Vener</P>
<P  >able
sir, happiness and joy are born from those who are dear, arise from
those who are dear.' Then, displeased with the recluse Gotama's
words, disapproving of them, I rose from my seat and left."</P>
<P  >"So
it is, householder, so it is! Happiness and joy are born from those
who are dear, arise from those who are dear."</P>
<P  >Then
the householder left thinking: "I agree with the gamblers."</P>
<P  >5.
Eventually this story reached the king's palace. Then King Pasenadi
of Kosala told Queen Mallika: "This is what has been said by the
recluse Gotama, Mallika: 'Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are
dear.'"</P>
<P  >"If
that has been said by the Blessed One, sire, then it is so."</P>
<P  >"No
matter what the recluse Gotama says, Mallika applauds it thus: 'If
that has been said by the Blessed One, sire, then it is so.' Just
as a pupil applauds whatever his teacher says to him, saying: 'So
it is, teacher, so it is!'; so too, Mallika, no matter what the
recluse Gotama says, you applaud it thus: 'If that [108] has been
said by the Blessed One, sire, then it is so.' Be off, Mallika,
away with you!"</P>
<P  >6.
Then Queen Mallika addressed the brahmin Nalijangha: "Come,
brahmin, go to the Blessed One and pay homage in my name with your
head at his feet, and ask whether he is free from illness and
affliction and is healthy, strong, and abiding in comfort, saying:
'Venerable sir, Queen Mallika pays homage with her head at the
Blessed One's feet and asks whether the Blessed One is free from
illness ... and abiding in comfort.' Then say this: 'Venerable
sir, have these words been uttered by the Blessed One: "Sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are
dear, arise from those who are dear"?' Learn well what the
Blessed One replies and report it to me; for Tathagatas do not speak
untruth."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
madam," he replied, and he went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said: "Master Gotama, Queen
Mallika pays homage with her head at Master Gotama's feet and asks
whether he is free from illness ... and abiding in comfort. And she
says this: 'Venerable</P>
<P  >sir,
have these words been spoken by the Blessed One: "Sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are
dear, arise from those who are dear"?'"</P>
<P  >7.
"So it is, brahmin, so it is! Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair are born from those who are dear, arise from those who are
dear.</P>
<P  >8.
"It can be understood from this, brahmin, how sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are dear, arise from
those who are dear. Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain
woman whose mother died. Owing to her mother's death, she went mad,
lost her mind, and wandered from street to street and from crossroad
to crossroad, saying: 'Have you seen my mother? Have you seen my
mother?' [109]</P>
<P  >9-14.
"And it can also be understood from this how sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are dear, arise from
those who are dear. Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain
woman whose father died ... whose brother died ... whose sister died
... whose son died ... whose daughter died ... whose husband died.
Owing to her husband's death, she went mad, lost her mind, and
wandered from street to street and from crossroad to crossroad,
saying: 'Have you seen my husband? Have you seen my husband?'</P>
<P  >15-21.
"And it can also be understood from this how sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are dear, arise from
those who are dear. Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain
man whose mother died ... whose father died ... whose brother died ...
whose sister died ... whose son died ... whose daughter died ...
whose wife died. Owing to his wife's death, he went mad, lost his
mind, and wandered from street to street and from crossroad to
crossroad, saying: 'Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my wife?'</P>
<P  >22.
"And it can also be understood from this how sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are dear, arise from
those who are dear. Once in this same Savatthi there was a certain
woman who went to live with her relatives' family. Her relatives
wanted to divorce her from her husband and give her to another whom
she did not want. Then the woman said to her husband: 'Lord, these
relatives of mine want to divorce me from you and give me to another
whom I</P>
<P  >do
not want.' Then the man cut the woman in two and [110] committed
suicide, thinking: 'We shall be together in the afterlife.' It
can also be understood from this how sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair are born from those who are dear, arise from those
who are dear."</P>
<P  >23.
Then, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One's words, the
brahmin Nalijangha rose from his seat, went to Queen Mallika, and
reported to her his entire conversation with the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >24.
Then Queen Mallika went to King Pasenadi of Kosala and asked him:
"What do you think, sire? Is Princess Vajiri dear to you?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
Mallika, Princess Vajiri is dear to me."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, sire? If.change and alteration<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote828anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote828sym"><SUP>dcccxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
took place in Princess Vajiri, would sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair arise in you?"</P>
<P  >"Change
and alteration in Princess Vajiri would mean an alteration in my
life. How could sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair not
arise in me?"</P>
<P  >"It
was with reference to this, sire, that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: 'Sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are
dear, arise from those who are dear.'</P>
<P  >25-28.
"What do you think, sire? Is the noble Queen Vasabha dear to you? ...
Is General Vidudabha dear to you? ... [111] ... Am I dear to you? ...
Are Kasi and Kosala dear to you?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote829anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote829sym"><SUP>dcccxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Yes,
Mallika, Kasi and Kosala are dear to me. We owe it to Kasi and Kosala
that we use Kasi sandalwood and wear garlands, scents, and unguents."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, sire? If change and alteration took place in Kasi and
Kosala, would sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise in
you?"</P>
<P  >"Change
and alteration in Kasi and Kosala would mean an alteration in my
life. How could sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair not
arise in me?"</P>
<P  >"It
was with reference to this, sire, that the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, said: 'Sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are born from those who are
dear, arise from those who are dear.'"</P>
<P  >29.
"It is wonderful, Mallika, it is marvellous how far [112] the
Blessed One penetrates with wisdom and sees with wisdom! Come,
Mallika, give me the ablution water."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote830anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote830sym"><SUP>dcccxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >Then
King Pasenadi of Kosala rose from his seat, and arranging his upper
robe on one shoulder, he extended his hands in reverential salutation
towards the Blessed One and uttered this exclamation three times:
"Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened!
Honour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened! Honour
to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened!"</P>
