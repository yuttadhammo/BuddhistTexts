<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you noble right concentration with its
supports and its requisites.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1099anc" HREF="#sdendnote1099sym"><SUP>mxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes, venerable
sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
“What, bhikkhus, is noble right concentration with its supports and
its requisites, that is, right view, right intention, right speech,
right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness?
Unification of mind equipped with these seven factors is called noble
right concentration with its supports and its requisites.</P>
<H3 >(VIEW)</H3>
<P  >4.
“Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1100anc" HREF="#sdendnote1100sym"><SUP>mc</SUP></A></SUP>
And how does right view come first? One understands wrong view as
wrong view and right view as right view: this is one’s right view.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1101anc" HREF="#sdendnote1101sym"><SUP>mci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
“And what, bhikkhus, is wrong view? ‘There is nothing given,
nothing offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and
bad actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no
beings who are reborn spontaneously; no [72] good and virtuous
recluses and brahmins in the world who have realised for themselves
by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.’
This is wrong view.</P>
<P  >6.
“And what, bhikkhus, is right view? Right view, I say, is twofold:
there is right view that is affected by taints, partaking of merit,
ripening on the side of attachment;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1102anc" HREF="#sdendnote1102sym"><SUP>mcii</SUP></A></SUP>
and there is right view that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a
factor of the path.</P>
<P  >7.
“And what, bhikkhus, is right view that is affected by the taints,
partaking of merit, ripening on the side of attachment? ‘There is
what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed; there is
fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world and the
other world; there is mother and father; there are beings who are
reborn spontaneously; there are in the world good and virtuous
recluses and brahmins who have realised for themselves by direct
knowledge and declare this world and the other world.’ This is
right view affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening on the
side of attachment.</P>
<P  >8.
“And what, bhikkhus, is right view that is noble, taintless,
supramundane, a factor of the path? The wisdom, the faculty of
wisdom, the power of wisdom, the investigation-of-states
enlightenment factor, the path factor of right view in one whose mind
is noble, whose mind is taintless, who possesses the noble path and
is developing the noble path:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1103anc" HREF="#sdendnote1103sym"><SUP>mciii</SUP></A></SUP>
this is right view that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor
of the path.</P>
<P  >9.
“One makes an effort to abandon wrong view and to enter upon right
view: this is one’s right effort. Mindfully one abandons wrong
view, mindfully one enters upon and abides in right view: this is
one’s right mindfulness. Thus these three states run and circle
around right view, that is, right view, right effort, and right
mindfulness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1104anc" HREF="#sdendnote1104sym"><SUP>mciv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

come first? One understands wrong intention as wrong intention and

“And what, bhikkhus, is wrong intention? The intention of sensual
desire, the intention of ill will, and the intention of cruelty: this
is wrong intention.</P>
<P  >12.
“And what, bhikkhus, is right intention? Right intention, I say, is
twofold: there is right intention that is affected by taints,

right intention that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of
the path.</P>

<P  >18.
“And what, bhikkhus, is right speech? Right speech, I say, is
twofold: there is right speech that is affected by taints, partaking
of merit, ripening on the side of attachment; and there is [74] right
speech that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path.</P>

<H3 >(ACTION)</H3>
<P  >22.

<P  >34.
“Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first. And how does right view
come first? [76] In one of right view, right intention comes into
being;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1111anc" HREF="#sdendnote1111sym"><SUP>mcxi</SUP></A></SUP>
in one of right intention, right speech comes into being; in one of

right livelihood comes into being; in one of right livelihood, right
effort comes into being; in one of right effort, right mindfulness
comes into being; in one of right mindfulness, right concentration
comes into being; in one of right concentration, right knowledge
comes into being; in one of right knowledge, right deliverance comes
into being. Thus, bhikkhus, the path of the disciple in higher
training possesses eight factors, the arahant possesses ten factors.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1112anc" HREF="#sdendnote1112sym"><SUP>mcxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >35.
“Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first. And how does right view
come first? In one of right view, wrong view is abolished, and the
many evil unwholesome states that originate with wrong view as
condition are also abolished, and the many wholesome states that
originate with right view as condition come to fulfilment by
development.</P>
<P  >“In
one of right intention, wrong intention is abolished, and the many
evil unwholesome states that originate with wrong intention as

action, wrong action is abolished … In one of right livelihood,
wrong livelihood is abolished [77] … In one of right effort, wrong
effort is abolished … In one of right mindfulness, wrong
mindfulness is abolished … In one of right concentration, wrong
concentration is abolished … In one of right knowledge, wrong
knowledge is abolished … In one of right deliverance, wrong
deliverance is abolished, and the many evil unwholesome states that
originate with wrong deliverance as condition are also abolished, and
the many wholesome states that originate with right deliverance as
condition come to fulfilment by development.</P>

“Thus, bhikkhus, there are twenty factors on the side of the
wholesome, and twenty factors on the side of the unwholesome.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1113anc" HREF="#sdendnote1113sym"><SUP>mcxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
This Dhamma discourse on the Great Forty has been set rolling and
cannot be stopped by any recluse or brahmin or god or Mara or Brahma
or anyone in the world.</P>
<P  >37.
“Bhikkhus, if any recluse or brahmin thinks that this Dhamma
discourse on the Great Forty should be censured and rejected, then
there are ten legitimate deductions from his assertions that would
provide grounds for censuring him here and now. If that worthy one
censures right view, then he would honour and praise those recluses
and brahmins who are of wrong view. If that worthy one censures right
intention, [78] then he would honour and praise those recluses and
brahmins who are of wrong intention. If that worthy one censures
right speech … right action … right livelihood … right effort …
right mindfulness.. .right concentration … right knowledge …
right deliverance, then he would honour and praise those recluses and
brahmins who are of wrong deliverance. If any recluse or brahmin
thinks that this Dhamma discourse on the Great Forty should be
censured and rejected, then these are ten legitimate deductions from
his assertions that would provide grounds for censuring him here and
now.</P>
<P  >38.
“Bhikkhus, even those teachers from Okkala, Vassa and Bhanna,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1114anc" HREF="#sdendnote1114sym"><SUP>mcxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
who held the doctrine of non-causality, the doctrine of non-doing,
and the doctrine of nihilism, would not think that this Dharnma
discourse on the Great Forty should be censured and rejected. Why is
that? For fear of blame, attack, and confutation.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
