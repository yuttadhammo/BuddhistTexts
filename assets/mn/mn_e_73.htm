73. Mahavacchagotta Sutta - The Greater Discourse to Vacchagotta</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >3.
"I have had conversations with Master Gotama for a long time. It
would be good if Master Gotama would teach me in brief the wholesome
and the unwholesome."</P>
<P  >"I
can teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome in brief, Vaccha, and
I can teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome at length. Still I
will teach you the wholesome and the unwholesome in brief. Listen and
attend closely to what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," he replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >4.
"Vaccha, greed is unwholesome, non-greed is wholesome; hate is
unwholesome, non-hate is wholesome; delusion is unwholesome,
non-delusion is wholesome. In this way three things are unwholesome
and the other three things are wholesome.</P>
<P  >5.
"Killing living beings is unwholesome, abstention from killing
living beings is wholesome; taking what is not given is unwholesome,
abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome; misconduct in
sensual pleasures is unwholesome, abstention from misconduct in
sensual pleasures is wholesome; false speech is unwholesome,
abstention from false speech is wholesome; malicious speech [490] is
unwholesome, abstention from malicious speech is wholesome; harsh
speech is unwholesome, abstention from harsh speech is wholesome;
gossip is unwholesome, abstention from gossip is wholesome;
covetousness is unwholesome, uncovetousness is wholesome; ill will is
unwholesome, non-ill will is wholesome; wrong view is unwholesome,
right view is wholesome. In this way ten things are unwholesome and
the other ten things are wholesome.</P>
<P  >6.
"When a bhikkhu has abandoned craving, cut it off at the root, made
it like a palm stump, done away with it so that it is no longer
subject to future arising, then that bhikkhu is an arahant with
taints destroyed, one who has lived the holy life, done what had to
be done, laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the
fetters of being, and is completely liberated through final
knowledge."</P>
<P  >7.
"Apart from Master Gotama, is there any one bhikkhu, Master
Gotama's disciple, who by realising for himself with direct
knowledge here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of
mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the
destruction of the taints?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote724anc" HREF="#sdendnote724sym"><SUP>dccxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"There
are not only one hundred, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five
hundred, but far more bhikkhus, my disciples, who by realising for
themselves with direct knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in
the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless
with the destruction of the taints."</P>
<P  >8.
"Apart from Master Gotama and the bhikkhus, is there any one
bhikkhuni, Master Gotama's disciple, who by realising for herself
with direct knowledge here and now enters upon and abides in the
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with
the destruction of the taints?"</P>
<P  >"There
are not only one hundred … or five hundred, but far more
bhikkhunis, my disciples, who by realising for themselves with direct
knowledge here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of
mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the
destruction of the taints."</P>
<P  >9.
"Apart from Master Gotama and the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, is there
any one man lay follower, Master Gotama's disciple, clothed in
white leading a life of celibacy who, with the destruction of the
five lower fetters, will reappear spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes]
and there attain final Nibbana without ever returning from that
world?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote725anc" HREF="#sdendnote725sym"><SUP>dccxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"There
are not only one hundred … or five hundred, but far more men lay
followers, my disciples, clothed in white leading lives of celibacy
who, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, [491] will
reappear spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain final
Nibbana without ever returning from that world."</P>
<P  >10.
"Apart from Master Gotama, the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, and the men
lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy, is there
any one man lay follower, Master Gotama's disciple, clothed in
white enjoying sensual pleasures, who carries out his instruction,
responds to his advice, has gone beyond doubt, become free from
perplexity, gained intrepidity, and become independent of others in
the Teacher's Dispensation?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote726anc" HREF="#sdendnote726sym"><SUP>dccxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"There
are not only one hundred … or five hundred, but far more men lay
followers, my disciples, clothed in white enjoying sensual pleasures,
who carry out my instruction, respond to my advice, have gone beyond
doubt, become free from perplexity, gained intrepidity, and become
independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation."</P>
<P  >11.
"Apart from Master Gotama, the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, and the men
lay followers clothed in white, both those leading lives of celibacy
and those enjoying sensual pleasures, is there any one woman lay
follower, Master Gotama's disciple, clothed in white leading a life
of celibacy who, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, will
reappear spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain final
Nibbana without ever returning from that world?"</P>
<P  >"There
are not only one hundred … or five hundred, but far more women lay
followers, my disciples, clothed in white leading lives of celibacy
who, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, will reappear
spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain final Nibbana
without ever returning from that world."</P>
<P  >12.
"Apart from Master Gotama, the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, and the men
lay followers clothed in white, both those leading lives of celibacy
and those enjoying sensual pleasures, and the women lay followers
clothed in white leading lives of celibacy, is there any one woman
lay follower, Master Gotama's disciple, clothed in white enjoying
sensual pleasures, who carries out his instruction, responds to his
advice, has gone beyond doubt, become free from perplexity, gained
intrepidity, and become independent of others in the Teacher's
Dispensation?"</P>
<P  >"There
are not only one hundred … or five hundred, but far more women lay
followers, my disciples, clothed in white enjoying sensual pleasures,
who carry out my instruction, respond to my advice, have gone beyond
doubt, become free of perplexity, gained intrepidity, and become
independent of others in the Teacher's Dispensation."</P>
<P  >13.
"Master Gotama, if only Master Gotama were accomplished in this
Dhamma, but no bhikkhus were accomplished, [492] then this holy life
would be deficient in that respect; but because Master Gotama and
bhikkhus are accomplished in this Dhamma, this holy life is thus
complete in that respect. If only Master Gotama and bhikkhus were
accomplished in this Dhamma, but no bhikkhunis were accomplished,
then this holy life would be deficient in that respect; but because
Master Gotama, bhikkhus, and bhikkhunis are accomplished in this
Dhamma, this holy life is thus complete in that respect. If only
Master Gotama, bhikkhus, and bhikkhunis were accomplished in this
Dhamma, but no men lay followers clothed in white leading lives of
celibacy were accomplished, then this holy life would be deficient in
that respect; but because Master Gotama, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, and
men lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy are
accomplished in this Dhamma, this holy life is thus complete in that
respect. If only Master Gotama, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, and men lay
followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy were
accomplished in this Dhamma, but no men lay followers clothed in
white enjoying sensual pleasures were accomplished, then this holy
life would be deficient in that respect; but because Master Gotama,
bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, and men lay followers clothed in white, both
those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures,
are accomplished in this Dhamma, this holy life is thus complete in
that respect. If only Master Gotama, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, and men
lay followers clothed in white … were accomplished in this Dhamma,
but no women lay followers clothed in white [493] leading lives of
celibacy were accomplished, then this holy life would be deficient in
that respect; but because Master Gotama, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, men
lay followers clothed in white … and women lay followers clothed in
white leading lives of celibacy are accomplished in this Dhamma, this
holy life is thus complete in that respect. If only Master Gotama,
bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, men lay followers clothed in white … and
women lay followers clothed in white leading lives of celibacy were
accomplished in this Dhamma, but no women lay followers clothed in
white enjoying sensual pleasures were accomplished, then this holy
life would be deficient in that respect; but because Master Gotama,
bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, men lay followers clothed in white, both
those leading lives of celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures,
and women lay followers clothed in white, both those leading lives of
celibacy and those enjoying sensual pleasures, are accomplished in
this Dhamma, this holy life is thus complete in that respect.</P>
<P  >14.
"Just as the river Ganges inclines towards the sea, slopes towards
the sea, flows towards the sea, and merges with the sea, so too
Master Gotama's assembly with its homeless ones and its
householders inclines towards Nibbana, slopes towards Nibbana, flows
towards Nibbana, and merges with Nibbana.</P>
<P  >15.
"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. I would
receive the going forth under Master Gotama, I would receive the full
admission." [494]</P>
<P  >16.
"Vaccha, one who formerly belonged to another sect and desires the
going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline
lives on probation for four months. At the end of four months, if the
bhikkhus are satisfied with him, they give him the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus' state. But I recognise
individual differences in this matter."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, if those who formerly belonged to another sect and desire the
going forth and the full admission in this Dhamma and Discipline live
on probation for four months, and if at the end of the four months
the bhikkhus being satisfied with them give them the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus' state, then I will live on
probation for four years. At the end of the four years if the
bhikkhus are satisfied with me, let them give me the going forth and
the full admission to the bhikkhus' state."</P>
<P  >17.
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta received the going forth under the
Blessed One, and he received the full admission. Not long after his
full admission, a half-month after his full admission, the venerable
Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him,
he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, I
have attained whatever can be attained by the knowledge of a disciple
in higher training, by the true knowledge of a disciple in higher
training. Let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma further."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote727anc" HREF="#sdendnote727sym"><SUP>dccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >18.
"In that case, Vaccha, develop further two things: serenity and
insight. When these two things are developed further, they will lead
to the penetration of many elements.</P>
<P  >19.
"To the extent that you may wish: 'May I wield the various kinds
of supernormal power: having been one, may I become many; having been
many, may I become one; may I appear and vanish; may I go unhindered
through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain, as though
through space; may I dive in and out of the earth as though it were
water; may I walk on water without sinking as though it were earth;
seated crosslegged, may I travel in space like a bird; with my hand
may I touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; may I
wield bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-world' - you will
attain the ability to witness any aspect therein, there being a
suitable basis.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote728anc" HREF="#sdendnote728sym"><SUP>dccxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >20.
"To the extent that you may wish: 'May I, with the divine ear
element, [495] which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both
kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those that are far as well
as near' - you will attain the ability to witness any aspect
therein, there being a suitable basis.</P>
<P  >21.
"To the extent that you may wish: 'May I understand the minds of
other beings, of other persons, having encompassed them with my own
mind. May I understand a mind affected by lust as affected by lust
and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; may I understand
a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by
hate as unaffected by hate; may I understand a mind affected by
delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as
unaffected by delusion; may I understand a contracted mind as
contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; may I understand an
exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; may I
understand a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as
unsurpassed; may I understand a concentrated mind as concentrated and
an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; may I understand a
liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated'
- you will attain the ability to witness any aspect therein, there
being a suitable basis.</P>
<P  >22.
"To the extent that you may wish: 'May I recollect my manifold
past lives, that is, one birth, two births … (as Sutta 51, §24) …
Thus with their aspects and particulars may I recollect my manifold
past lives' - you will attain the ability to witness any aspect
therein, there being a suitable basis. [496]</P>
<P  >23.
"To the extent that you may wish: 'May I, with the divine eye,
which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away
and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and
unfortunate … (as Sutta 51, §25) … and may I understand how
beings pass on according to their actions' - you will attain the
ability to witness any aspect therein, there being a suitable basis.</P>
<P  >24.
"To the extent that you may wish: 'May I, by realising for myself
with direct knowledge, here and now enter upon and abide in the
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with
the destruction of the taints' - you will attain the ability to
witness any aspect therein, there being a suitable basis."</P>
<P  >25.
Then the venerable Vacchagotta, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to
the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.</P>
<P  >26.
Before long, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and
resolute, the venerable Vacchagotta, by realising for himself with
direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that
supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly
go forth from the home life into homelessness. He directly knew:
"Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be
done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being."
And the venerable Vacchagotta became one of the arahants.</P>
<P  >27.
Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus were going to see the
Blessed One. The venerable Vacchagotta saw them coming in the
distance. Seeing them, he went to them and asked them: [497] "Where
are the venerable ones going?"</P>
<P  >"We
are going to see the Blessed One, friend."</P>
<P  >"In
that case, may the venerable ones pay homage in my name with their
heads at the Blessed One's feet, saying: 'Venerable sir, the
bhikkhu Vacchagotta pays homage with his head at the Blessed One's
feet.' Then say: 'The Blessed One has been worshipped by me, the
Sublime One has been worshipped by me!"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote729anc" HREF="#sdendnote729sym"><SUP>dccxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Yes,
friend," those bhikkhus replied. Then they went to the Blessed One,
and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told
the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, the venerable Vacchagotta pays
homage with his head at the Blessed One's feet, and he says: 'The
Blessed One has been worshipped by me, the Sublime One has been
worshipped by me.'"</P>
<P  >28.
"Bhikkhus, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I already
knew of the bhikkhu Vacchagotta: 'The bhikkhu Vacchagotta has
attained the threefold true knowledge and has great supernormal power
and might.' And deities also told me this: 'The bhikkhu
Vacchagotta has attained the threefold true knowledge and has great
supernormal power and might.'"</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. Those bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
