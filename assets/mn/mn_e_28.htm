28. Mahahatthipadopama Sutta - The Greater Discourse on the Simile of
the Elephant's Footprint</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote327anc" HREF="#sdendnote327sym"><SUP>cccxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's
Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There the venerable Sariputta
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Friends, bhikkhus." - "Friend,"
they replied. The venerable Sariputta said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Friends, just as the footprint of any living being that walks can
be placed within an elephant's footprint, and so the elephant's
footprint is declared the chief of them because of its great size; so
too, all wholesome states can be included in the Four Noble Truths.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote328anc" HREF="#sdendnote328sym"><SUP>cccxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
In what four? In the noble truth of suffering, [185] in the noble
truth of the origin of suffering, in the noble truth of the cessation
of suffering, and in the noble truth of the way leading to the
cessation of suffering.</P>
<P  >3.
"And what is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering,
ageing is suffering, death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair are suffering; not to obtain what one wants is
suffering; in short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are
suffering.</P>
<P  >4.
"And what are the five aggregates affected by clinging? They are:
the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling
aggregate affected by clinging, the perception aggregate affected by
clinging, the formations aggregate affected by clinging, and the
consciousness aggregate affected by clinging.</P>
<P  >5.
"And what is the material form aggregate affected by clinging? It
is the four great elements and the material form derived from the
four great elements. And what are the four great elements? They are
the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air
element.</P>
<H3 >(THE EARTH ELEMENT)</H3>
<P  >6.
"What, friends, is the earth element? The earth element may be
either internal or external. What is the internal earth element?
Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, and
clung-to; that is, head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,
sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen,
lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach,
feces, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is solid,
solidified, and clung-to: this is called the internal earth element.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote329anc" HREF="#sdendnote329sym"><SUP>cccxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element
are simply earth element.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote330anc" HREF="#sdendnote330sym"><SUP>cccxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus:
'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' When one
sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes
disenchanted with the earth element and makes the mind dispassionate
toward the earth element.</P>
<P  >7.
"Now there comes a time when the water element is disturbed and
then the external earth element vanishes.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote331anc" HREF="#sdendnote331sym"><SUP>cccxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
When even this external earth element, great as it is, is seen to be
impermanent, subject to destruction, disappearance, and change, what
of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while?
There can be no considering that as 'I' or 'mine' or 'I
am.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote332anc" HREF="#sdendnote332sym"><SUP>cccxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
"So then, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass a bhikkhu [who
has seen this element as it actually is], he understands thus: 'This
painful feeling born of ear-contact has arisen in me. That is
dependent, not independent. Dependent on what? [186] Dependent on
contact.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote333anc" HREF="#sdendnote333sym"><SUP>cccxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then he sees that contact is impermanent, that feeling is
impermanent, that perception is impermanent, that formations are
impermanent, and that consciousness is impermanent. And his mind,
having made an element its objective support, enters into [that new
objective support] and acquires confidence, steadiness, and
decision.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote334anc" HREF="#sdendnote334sym"><SUP>cccxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9.
"Now, if others attack that bhikkhu in ways that are unwished for,
undesired, and disagreeable, by contact with fists, clods, sticks, or
knives, he understands thus: 'This body is of such a nature that
contact with fists, clods, sticks, and knives assail it.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote335anc" HREF="#sdendnote335sym"><SUP>cccxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
But this has been said by the Blessed One in his "advice on the
simile of the saw": "Bhikkhus, even if bandits</P>
<P  >were
to sever you savagely limb by limb with a two-handled saw, he who
gave rise to a mind of hate towards them would not be carrying out my
teaching."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote336anc" HREF="#sdendnote336sym"><SUP>cccxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
So tireless energy shall be aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness
established, my body shall be tranquil and untroubled, my mind
concentrated and unified. And now let contact with fists, clods,
sticks, and knives assail this body; for this is just how the
Buddha's teaching is practised.'</P>
<P  >10.
"When that bhikkhu thus recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the
Sangha, if equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become
established in him, then he arouses a sense of urgency thus: 'It is
a loss for me, it is no gain for me, it is bad for me, it is no good
for me, that when I thus recollect the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the
Sangha, equanimity supported by the wholesome does not become
established in me.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote337anc" HREF="#sdendnote337sym"><SUP>cccxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as when a daughter-in-law sees her father-in-law, she arouses a
sense of urgency [to please him], so too, when that bhikkhu thus
recollects the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, if equanimity
supported by the wholesome does not become established in him, then
he arouses a sense of urgency. But if, when he recollects the Buddha,
the Dhamma, and the Sangha, equanimity supported by the wholesome
becomes established in him, [187] then he is satisfied with it. At
that point, friends, much has been done by that bhikkhu.</P>
<H3 >(THE WATER ELEMENT)</H3>
<P  >11.
"What, friends, is the water element? The water element may be
either internal or external. What is the internal water element?
Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and
clung-to; that is, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears,
grease, spittle, snot, oil-of-the-joints, urine, or whatever else
internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and clungto: this
is called the internal water element. Now both the internal water
element and the external water element are simply water element. And
that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This
is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' When one sees it
thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted
with the water element and makes the mind dispassionate toward the
water element.</P>
<P  >12.
"Now there comes a time when the external water element is
disturbed. It carries away villages, towns, cities, districts, and
countries. There comes a time when the waters in the great ocean sink
down a hundred leagues, two hundred leagues, three hundred leagues,
four hundred leagues, five hundred leagues, six hundred leagues,
seven hundred leagues. There comes a time when the waters in the
great ocean stand seven palms deep, six palms deep … two palms
deep, only a palm deep. There comes a time when the waters in the
great ocean stand seven fathoms deep, six fathoms deep … two
fathoms deep, only a fathom deep. There comes a time when the waters
in the great ocean stand half a fathom deep, only waist deep, only
knee deep, only ankle deep. There comes a time when the waters in the
great ocean are not enough to wet even the joint of a finger. When
even this external water element, great as it is, [188] is seen to be
impermanent, subject to destruction, disappearance, and change, what
of this body, which is clung to by craving and lasts but a while?
There can be no considering that as 'I' or 'mine' or 'I
am.'</P>
<P  >13-15.
"So then, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass a bhikkhu [who
has seen this element as it actually is], he understands thus: …
(repeat §§8-10) … At that point too, friends, much has been done
by that bhikkhu.</P>
<H3 >(THE FIRE ELEMENT)</H3>
<P  >16.
"What, friends, is the fire element? The fire element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal fire element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and clung-to; that
is, that by which one is warmed, ages, and is consumed, and that by
which what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets completely
digested, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is fire,
fiery, and clung-to: this is called the internal fire element. Now
both the internal fire element and the external fire element are
simply fire element. And that should be seen as it actually is with
proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not
my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the fire element and makes the
mind dispassionate toward the fire element.</P>
<P  >17.
"Now there comes a time when the external fire element is
disturbed. It burns up villages, towns, cities, districts, and
countries. It goes out due to lack of fuel only when it comes to
green grass, or to a road, or to a rock, or to water, or to a fair
open space. There comes a time when they seek to make a fire even
with cocks' feathers and hide-parings. When even this external fire
element, great as it is, is seen to be impermanent, subject to
destruction, disappearance, and change, what of this body, which is
clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no
considering that as 'I' or 'mine' or 'I am.'</P>
<P  >18-20.
"So then, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass a bhikkhu [who
has seen this element as it actually is], he understands thus: …
(repeat §§8-10) … At that point too, friends, much has been done
by that bhikkhu.</P>
<H3 >(THE AIR ELEMENT)</H3>
<P  >21.
"What, friends, is the air element? The air element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal air element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clung-to; that
is, up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the belly, winds in
the bowels, winds that course through the limbs, in-breath and
out-breath, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is
air, airy, and clung-to: this is called the internal air element. Now
both the internal air element and the external air element are simply
air element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper
wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my
self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom,
one becomes disenchanted with the air element and makes the mind
dispassionate toward the air element. [189]</P>
<P  >22.
"Now there comes a time when the external air element is disturbed.
It sweeps away villages, towns, cities, districts, and countries.
There comes a time in the last month of the hot season when they seek
wind by means of a fan or bellows and even the strands of straw in
the drip-fringe of the thatch do not stir. When even this external
air element, great as it is, is seen to be impermanent, subject to
destruction, disappearance, and change, what of this body, which is
clung to by craving and lasts but a while? There can be no
considering that as 'I' or 'mine' or 'I am.'</P>
<P  >23-25.
"So then, if others abuse, revile, scold, and harass a bhikkhu [who
has seen this element as it actually is], he understands thus: …
[190] (repeat §§8-10) … At that point too, friends, much has been
done by that bhikkhu.</P>
<P  >26.
"Friends, just as when a space is enclosed by timber and creepers,
grass, and clay, it comes to be termed 'house,' so too, when a
space is enclosed by bones and sinews, flesh and skin, it comes to be
termed 'material form.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote338anc" HREF="#sdendnote338sym"><SUP>cccxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >27.
"If, friends, internally the eye is intact but no external forms
come into its range, and there is no corresponding [conscious]
engagement, then there is no manifestation of the corresponding class
of consciousness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote339anc" HREF="#sdendnote339sym"><SUP>cccxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
If internally the eye is intact and external forms come into its
range, but there is no corresponding [conscious] engagement, then
there is no manifestation of the corresponding class of
consciousness. But when internally the eye is intact and external
forms come into its range and there is the corresponding [conscious]
engagement, then there is the manifestation of the corresponding
class of consciousness.</P>
<P  >28.
"The material form in what has thus come to be is included in the
material form aggregate affected by clinging.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote340anc" HREF="#sdendnote340sym"><SUP>cccxl</SUP></A></SUP>
The feeling in what has thus come to be is included in the feeling
aggregate affected by clinging. The perception in what has thus come
to be is included in the perception aggregate affected by clinging.
The formations in what has thus come to be are included in the
formations aggregate affected by clinging. The consciousness in what
has thus come to be is included in the consciousness aggregate
affected by clinging. He understands thus: 'This, indeed, is how
there comes to be the inclusion, gathering, and amassing of things
into these five aggregates affected by clinging. Now this has been
said by the Blessed One: "One who sees [191] dependent origination
sees the Dhamma; one who sees the Dhamma sees dependent
origination."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote341anc" HREF="#sdendnote341sym"><SUP>cccxli</SUP></A></SUP>
And these five aggregates affected by clinging are dependently
arisen. The desire, indulgence, inclination, and holding based on
these five aggregates affected by clinging is the origin of
suffering.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote342anc" HREF="#sdendnote342sym"><SUP>cccxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
The removal of desire and lust, the abandonment of desire and lust
for these five aggregates affected by clinging is the cessation of
suffering.' At that point too, friends, much has been done by that
bhikkhu.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote343anc" HREF="#sdendnote343sym"><SUP>cccxliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >29-30.
"If, friends, internally the ear is intact but no external sounds
come into its range … (as in §§27-28) … At that point too,
friends, much has been done by that bhikkhu.</P>
<P  >31-32.
"If, friends, internally the nose is intact but no external smells
come into its range … At that point too, friends, much has been
done by that bhikkhu.</P>
<P  >33-34.
"If, friends, internally the tongue is intact but no external
flavours come into its range … At that point too, friends, much has
been done by that bhikkhu.</P>
<P  >35-36.
"If, friends, internally the body is intact but no external
tangibles come into its range … At that point too, friends, much
has been done by that bhikkhu.</P>
<P  >37.
"If, friends, internally the mind is intact but no external
mind-objects come into its range, and there is no corresponding
[conscious] engagement, then there is no manifestation of the
corresponding class of consciousness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote344anc" HREF="#sdendnote344sym"><SUP>cccxliv</SUP></A></SUP>
If internally the mind is intact and external mind-objects come into
its range, but there is no corresponding [conscious] engagement, then
there is no manifestation of the corresponding class of
consciousness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote345anc" HREF="#sdendnote345sym"><SUP>cccxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
But when internally the mind is intact and external mind-objects come
into its range and there is the corresponding [conscious] engagement,
then there is the manifestation of the corresponding class of
consciousness.</P>

"The material form in what has thus come to be is included in the
material form aggregate affected by clinging. The feeling in what has
thus come to be is included in the feeling aggregate affected by
clinging. The perception in what has thus come to be is included in
the perception aggregate affected by clinging. The formations in what

<P  >That
is what the venerable Sariputta said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the venerable Sariputta's words.</P>
