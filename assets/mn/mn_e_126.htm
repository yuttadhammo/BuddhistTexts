126. Bhumija Sutta - Bhumija</H2>
<P  >[138]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Bhumija dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, went to the house of Prince Jayasena and sat
down on a seat made ready.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1178anc" HREF="#sdendnote1178sym"><SUP>mclxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then Prince Jayasena went to the venerable Bhumija and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said to the venerable Bhumija:
"Master Bhumija, there are some recluses and brahmins who make such
assertions and hold such views as this: 'If one makes an
aspiration<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1179anc" HREF="#sdendnote1179sym"><SUP>mclxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
and one leads the holy life, one is unable to procure any fruit; if
one makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life, one is still
unable to procure any fruit; if one both makes an aspiration and
makes no aspiration and one leads the holy life, one is still unable
to procure any fruit; if one neither makes an aspiration nor makes no
aspiration and one leads the holy life, one is still unable to
procure any fruit.' What does the venerable Bhumija's teacher say
here, what does he declare?"</P>
<P  >4.
"1 have not heard and learned that from the Blessed One's own
lips, prince. But it is possible that the Blessed One might say this:
'If one makes an aspiration and one leads the holy life unwisely,
one is unable to procure any fruit; if one makes no aspiration and
one leads the holy life unwisely, one is still unable to procure any
fruit; if one both makes an aspiration and makes no aspiration and
one leads the holy life unwisely, one is still unable to procure any
fruit; if one neither makes an aspiration nor makes no aspiration and
one leads the holy life unwisely, one is still unable to procure any
fruit. However, if one makes an aspiration and one leads the holy
life wisely, one is able to procure fruit; [139] if one makes no
aspiration and one leads the holy life wisely, one is still able to
procure fruit; if one both makes an aspiration and makes no
aspiration and one leads the holy life wisely, one is still able to
procure fruit; if one neither makes an aspiration nor makes no
aspiration and one leads the holy life wisely, one is still able to
procure fruit.' I have not heard and learned this from the Blessed
One's own lips, prince, but it is possible that the Blessed One
would answer as I have stated."</P>
<P  >5.
"If Master Bhumija's teacher speaks thus, if he declares thus,
then it certainly seems that the venerable Bhumija's teacher stands
ahead of all the ordinary recluses and brahmins."</P>
<P  >6.
Then Prince Jayasena served the venerable Bhumija from his own dish
of milk rice.</P>
<P  >7.
Then, when the venerable Bhumija had returned from his almsround
after his meal, he went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to
him, he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what had
occurred, adding: "Venerable sir, I hope that when I was asked such
a question and answered thus, I said what has been said by the
Blessed One and did not misrepresent him with what is contrary to
fact. I hope I explained in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way
that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately
deduced from my assertion." [140]</P>
<P  >8.
"Surely, Bhumija, when you were asked such a question and answered
thus, you said what has been said by me and did not misrepresent me
with what is contrary to fact. You explained in accordance with the
Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure
can be legitimately deduced from your assertion.</P>
<P  >9.
"Whatever recluses and brahmins have wrong view, wrong intention,
wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong
mindfulness, and wrong concentration, if they make an aspiration and
they lead the holy life, they are unable to procure any fruit; if
they make no aspiration and they lead the holy life, they are still
unable to procure any fruit; if they both make an aspiration and make
no aspiration and they lead the holy life, they are still unable to
procure any fruit; if they neither make an aspiration nor make no
aspiration and they lead the holy life, they are still unable to
procure any fruit. Why is that? Because that [wrong path] is not a
proper method for procuring fruit.</P>
<P  >10.
"Suppose a man needing oil, seeking oil, wandering in search of
oil, were to heap up gravel in a tub, sprinkle it all over with
water, and press it. Then, if he made an aspiration and acted thus,
he would be unable to procure any oil; if he made no aspiration and
acted thus, he would still be unable to procure any oil; if he both
made an aspiration and made no aspiration and acted thus, he would
still be unable to procure any oil; if he neither made an aspiration
nor made no aspiration and acted thus, he would still be unable to
procure any oil. Why is that? Because that [way of acting] is not a
proper method for procuring oil. So too, whatever recluses and
brahmins have wrong view … they are still unable to procure any
fruit. [141] Why is that? Because that [wrong path] is not a proper
method for procuring fruit.</P>
<P  >11.
"Suppose a man needing milk, seeking milk, wandering in search of
milk, were to pull a recently-calved cow by her horn. Then, if he
made an aspiration … if he made no aspiration … if he both made
an aspiration and made no aspiration … if he neither made an
aspiration nor made no aspiration and acted thus, he would still be
unable to procure any milk. Why is that? Because that [way of acting]
is not a proper method for procuring milk. So too, whatever recluses

fruit. Why is that? Because that [wrong path] is not a proper method
for procuring fruit.</P>
<P  >12.
"Suppose a man needing butter, seeking butter, wandering in search
of butter, were to pour water into a churn and churn it with a
churning-stick. Then, if he made an aspiration … if he made no
aspiration … if he both made an aspiration and made no aspiration …
if he neither made an aspiration nor made no aspiration and acted
thus, he would still be unable to procure any butter. Why is that?
Because that [way of acting] is not a proper method for procuring
butter. So too, whatever recluses and brahmins have wrong view …
they are still unable to procure any fruit. Why is that? Because that
[wrong path] is not a proper method for procuring fruit.</P>
<P  >13.
"Suppose a man needing fire, seeking fire, wandering in search of
fire, were to take an [142] upper fire-stick and rub a wet sappy
piece of wood with it. Then, if he made an aspiration … if he made
no aspiration … if he both made an aspiration and made no
aspiration … if he neither made an aspiration nor made no
aspiration and acted thus, he would still be unable to procure any
fire. Why is that? Because that [way of acting] is not a proper
method for procuring fire. So too, whatever recluses and brahmins
have wrong view … they are still unable to procure any fruit. Why
is that? Because that [wrong path] is not a proper method for
procuring fruit.</P>
<P  >14.
"Whatever recluses and brahmins have right view, right intention,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration, if they make an aspiration and
they lead the holy life, they are able to procure fruit; if they make
no aspiration and they lead the holy life, they are still able to
procure fruit; if they both make an aspiration and make no aspiration
and they lead the holy life, they are still able to procure fruit; if
they neither make an aspiration nor make no aspiration and they lead
the holy life, they are still able to procure fruit. Why is that?
Because that [right path] is a proper method for procuring fruit.</P>
<P  >15.
"Suppose a man needing oil, seeking oil, wandering in search of
oil, were to heap up sesamum flour in a tub, sprinkle it all over
with water, and press it. Then, if he made an aspiration and acted

acted thus, he would still be able to procure oil; if he both made an

is that? Because that [way of acting] is a proper method for

[143] … they are still able to procure fruit. Why is that? Because
that [right path] is a proper method for procuring fruit.</P>
<P  >16.
"Suppose a man needing milk, seeking milk, wandering in search of
milk, were to pull a recently-calved cow by her udder. Then, if he
made an aspiration … if he made no aspiration … if he both made
an aspiration and made no aspiration … if he neither made an
aspiration nor made no aspiration and acted thus, he would still be
able to procure milk. Why is that? Because that [way of acting] is a

Why is that? Because that [right path] is a proper method for

"Bhumija, if these four similes had occurred to you [with
reference] to Prince Jayasena, he would have spontaneously acquired
confidence in you, and being confident, would have shown his
confidence to you."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, how could these four similes have occurred to me [with
reference] to Prince Jayasena as they occur to the Blessed One, since
they are spontaneous and have never been heard before?"</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Bhumija was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
