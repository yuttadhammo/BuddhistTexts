107. Ganakamoggallana Sutta - To Ganaka Moggallana</H2>
<P  >[111.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara's Mother.
Then the brahmin Ganaka Moggallana went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >2.
"Master Gotama, in this Palace of Migara's Mother there can be
seen gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress, that
is, down to the last step of the staircase.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1024anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1024sym"><SUP>mxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Among these brahmins too, there can be seen gradual training, gradual
practice, and gradual progress, that is, in study. Among archers too,
there can be seen gradual training ... that is, in archery. And also
among accountants<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1025anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1025sym"><SUP>mxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
like us, who earn our living by accountancy, there can be seen
gradual training ... that is, in computation. For when we get an
apprentice first we make him count: one one, two twos, three threes,
four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine
nines, ten tens; and we make him count a hundred too. Now is it also
possible, Master Gotama, to describe gradual training, gradual
practice, and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Discipline?" [2]</P>
<P  >3.
"It is possible, brahmin, to describe gradual training, gradual
practice, and gradual progress in this Dhamma and Discipline. Just
as, brahmin, when a clever horse-trainer obtains a fine thoroughbred
colt, he first makes him get used to wearing the bit, and afterwards
trains him further,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1026anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1026sym"><SUP>mxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
so when the Tathagata obtains a person to be tamed he first
disciplines him thus: 'Come, bhikkhu, be virtuous, restrained with
the restraint of the Patimokkha, be perfect in conduct and resort,
and seeing fear in the slightest fault, train by undertaking the
training precepts.'</P>
<P  >4.
"When, brahmin, the bhikkhu is virtuous ... and seeing fear in the
slightest fault, trains by undertaking the training precepts, then
the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, guard the
doors of your sense faculties. On seeing a form with the eye, do not
grasp at its signs and features. Since, if you were to leave the eye
faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief
might invade you, practise the way of its restraint, guard the eye
faculty, undertake the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a
sound with the ear ... On smelling an odour with the nose ... On
tasting a flavour with the tongue ... On touching a tangible with the
body ... On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, do not grasp at
its signs and features. Since, if you were to leave the mind faculty
unguarded, evil unwholesome states might invade you, practise the way
of its restraint, guard the mind faculty, undertake the restraint of
the mind faculty.'</P>
<P  >5.
"When, brahmin, the bhikkhu guards the doors of his sense
faculties, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come,
bhikkhu, be moderate in eating. Reflecting wisely, you should take
food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of
physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and
continuance of this body, for ending discomfort, and for assisting
the holy life, considering: "Thus I shall terminate old feelings
without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless
and shall live in comfort.'"</P>
<P  >6.
"When, [3] brahmin, the bhikkhu is moderate in eating, then the
Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, be devoted to
wakefulness. During the day, while walking back and forth and
sitting, purify your mind of obstructive states. In the first watch
of the night, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify your
mind of obstructive states. In the middle watch of the night you
should lie down on the right side in the lion's pose with one foot
overlapping the other, mindful and fully aware, after noting in your
mind the time for rising. After rising, in the third watch of the
night, while walking back and forth and sitting, purify your mind of
obstructive states.'</P>
<P  >7.
"When, brahmin, the bhikkhu is devoted to wakefulness, then the
Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come, bhikkhu, be possessed of
mindfulness and full awareness. Act in full awareness when going
forward and returning; act in full awareness when looking ahead and
looking away; act in full awareness</P>
<P  >when
flexing and extending your limbs; act in full awareness when wearing
your robes and carrying your outer robe and bowl; act in full
awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; act in
full awareness when defecating and urinating; act in full awareness
when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking,
and keeping silent.'</P>
<P  >8.
"When, brahmin, the bhikkhu possesses mindfulness and full
awareness, then the Tathagata disciplines him further: 'Come,
bhikkhu, resort to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of
a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a
jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.'</P>
<P  >9.
"He resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest ... a heap of
straw. On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down,
folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing
mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he
abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from
covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind
free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living
beings; he purifies his mind from. ill will and hatred. Abandoning
sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor, percipient of
light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind from sloth and
torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides unagitated
with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness
and remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone beyond doubt,
unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.
[4]</P>
<P  >10.
"Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the
mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. With the stilling of
applied and sustained thought, he enters upon and abides in the
second jhana, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind
without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born
of concentration. With the fading away as well of rapture, he abides
in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure
with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on
account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abiding
who has equanimity and is mindful.' With the abandoning of pleasure
and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, he
enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity.</P>
<P  >11.
"This is my instruction, brahmin, to those bhikkhus who are in the
higher training, whose minds have not yet attained the goal, who
abide aspiring to the supreme security from bondage. But these things
conduce both to a pleasant abiding here and now and to mindfulness
and full awareness for those bhikkhus who are arahants with taints
destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done,
laid down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of
being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1027anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1027sym"><SUP>mxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
When this was said, the brahmin Ganaka Moggallana asked the Blessed
One: "When Master Gotama's disciples are thus advised and
instructed by him, do they all attain Nibbana, the ultimate goal, or
do some not attain it?"</P>
<P  >"When,
brahmin, they are thus advised and instructed by me, some of my
disciples attain Nibbana, the ultimate goal, and some do not attain
it."</P>
<P  >13.
"Master Gotama, since Nibbana exists and the path leading to
Nibbana exists and Master Gotama is present as the guide, what is the
cause and reason why, when Master Gotama's disciples are thus
advised and instructed by him, some of them attain Nibbana, the
ultimate goal, and some do not attain it?"</P>
<P  >14.
"As to that, brahmin, I will ask you a question in return. Answer
it as you choose. [5] What do you think, brahmin? Are you familiar
with the road leading to Rajagaha?"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
Master Gotama, I am familiar with the road leading to Rajagaha."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, brahmin? Suppose a man came who wanted to go to
Rajagaha, and he approached you and said: 'Venerable sir, I want to
go to Rajagaha. Show me the road to Rajagaha.' Then you told him:
'Now, good man, this road goes to Rajagaha. Follow it for awhile
and you will see a certain village, go a little further and you will
see a certain town, go a little further and you will see Rajagaha
with its lovely parks, groves, meadows, and ponds.' Then, having
been thus advised and instructed by you, he would take a wrong road
and would go to the west. Then a second man came who wanted to go to
Rajagaha, and he approached you and said: 'Venerable sir, I want to
go to Rajagaha.' Then you told him: 'Now, good man, this road
goes to Rajagaha. Follow it for a while ... and you will see Rajagaha
with its lovely parks, groves, meadows, and ponds.' Then, having
been thus advised and instructed by you, he would arrive safely in
Rajagaha. Now, brahmin, since Rajagaha exists and the path leading to
Rajagaha exists and you are present as the guide, what is the cause
and reason why, when those men have been thus advised and instructed
by you, one man takes a wrong road and goes to the west and one
arrives safely in Rajagaha?" [6]</P>
<P  >"What
can I do about that, Master Gotama? I am one who shows the way."</P>
<P  >"So
too, brahmin, Nibbana exists and the path leading to Nibbana exists
and I am present as the guide. Yet when my disciples have been thus
advised and instructed by me, some of them attain Nibbana, the
ultimate goal, and some do not attain it. What can I do about that,
brahmin? The Tathagata is one who shows the way."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1028anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1028sym"><SUP>mxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
When this was said, the brahmin Ganaka Moggallana said to the Blessed
One:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1029anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1029sym"><SUP>mxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
"There are persons who are faithless and have gone forth from the
home life into homelessness not out of faith but seeking a
livelihood, who are fraudulent, deceitful, treacherous, haughty,
hollow, personally vain, rough-tongued, loose-spoken, unguarded in
their sense faculties, immoderate in eating, undevoted to
wakefulness, unconcerned with recluseship, not greatly respectful of
training, luxurious, careless, leaders in backsliding, neglectful of
seclusion, lazy, wanting in energy, unmindful, not fully aware,
unconcentrated, with straying minds, devoid of wisdom, drivellers.
Master Gotama does not dwell together with these.</P>
<P  >"But
there are clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home
life into homelessness, who are not fraudulent, deceitful,
treacherous, haughty, hollow, personally vain, roughtongued, and
loose-spoken; who are guarded in their sense faculties, moderate in
eating, devoted to wakefulness, concerned with recluseship, greatly
respectful of training, not luxurious or careless, who are keen to
avoid backsliding, leaders in seclusion, energetic, resolute,
established in mindfulness, fully aware, concentrated, with unified
minds, possessing wisdom, not drivellers. Master Gotama dwells
together with these.</P>
<P  >16
"Just as black orris root is reckoned as the best of root perfumes
and red sandalwood is reckoned as the best of wood perfumes and
jasmine is reckoned as the best of flower perfumes, [7] so too,
Master Gotama's advice is supreme among the teachings of today.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1030anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1030sym"><SUP>mxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >17.
"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overturned, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master
Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge
for life."</P>
