77.Mahasakuludayi Sutta - The Greater Discourse<BR>to Sakuludayin</H2>
<P  >[1]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a number of well-known wanderers were staying at
the Peacocks' Sanctuary, the wanderers' park - that is,
Annabhara, Varadhara, and the wanderer Sakuludayin, as well as other
well-known wanderers.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Rajagaha for alms. Then he thought:
"It is still too early to wander for alms in Rajagaha. Suppose I
went to the wanderer Sakuludayin in the Peacocks' Sanctuary, the
wanderers' park."</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One when to the Peacocks' Sanctuary, the
wanderers' park. Now on that occasion the wanderer Sakuludayin was
seated with a large assembly of wanderers who were making an uproar,
loudly and noisily talking many kinds of pointless talk, such as talk
of kings ... (as Sutta 76, ยง4) [2] ... whether things are so or are
not so. Then the wanderer Sakuludayin saw the Blessed One coming in
the distance. Seeing him, he quieted his own assembly thus: "Sirs,
be quiet; sirs, make no noise. Here comes the recluse Gotama. This
venerable one likes quiet and commends quiet. Perhaps if he finds our
assembly a quiet one, he will think to join us." Then the wanderers
became silent.</P>
<P  >5.
The Blessed One went to the wanderer Sakuludayin, who said to him:
"Let the Blessed One come, venerable sir! Welcome to the Blessed
One! It is long since the Blessed One found an opportunity to come
here. Let the Blessed One be seated; this seat is ready."</P>
<P  >The
Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready, and the wanderer
Sakuludayin took a low seat and sat down at one side.</P>
<P  >When
he had done so, the Blessed One asked him: "For what discussion are
you sitting together here now, Udayin? And what was your discussion
that was interrupted?"</P>
<P  >6.
"Venerable sir, let be the discussion for which we are now sitting
together here. The Blessed One can well hear about it later. In
recent days, venerable sir, when recluses and brahmins of various
sects have been gathering together and sitting together in the
debating hall, this topic has arisen: 'It is a gain for the people
of Anga and Magadha, it is a great gain for the people of Anga and
Magadha that these recluses and brahmins, heads of orders, heads of
groups, teachers of groups, well-known and famous founders of sects
regarded by many as saints, have come to spend the Rains at Rajagaha.
There is this Purana Kassapa, the head of an order, the head of a
group, the teacher of a group, the well-known and famous founder of a
sect regarded by many as a saint: he has come to spend the Rains at
Rajagaha. There is also this Makkhali Gosala ... this Ajita
Kesakambalin ... this Pakudha Kaccayana ... this Sanjaya
Belatthiputta ... this Nigantha Nataputta, the head of an order, the
head of a group, the teacher of a group, [3] the well-known and
famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint: he too has come
to spend the Rains at Rajagaha. There is also this recluse Gotama,
the head of an order, the head of a group, the teacher of a group,
the wellknown and famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a
saint: he too has come to spend the Rains at Rajagaha. Now among
these worthy recluses and brahmins, heads of orders ... regarded by
many as saints, who is honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by
his disciples? And how, honouring and respecting him, do they live in
dependence on him?'</P>
<P  >"Thereupon
some said this: 'This Purana Kassapa is the head of an order ...
regarded by many as a saint, yet he is not honoured, respected,
revered, and venerated by his disciples, nor do his disciples live in
dependence on him, honouring and respecting him. Once Purana Kassapa
was teaching his Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers.
Then a certain disciple of his made a noise thus: "Sirs, do not ask
Purana Kassapa this question. He does not know that. We know that.
Ask us that question. We will answer that for you, sirs." It
happened that Purana Kassapa did not get his way, though he waved his
arms and wailed: "Be quiet, sirs, make no noise, sirs. They are not
asking you, sirs. They are asking us. We will answer them." Indeed,
many of his disciples left him after refuting his doctrine thus: "You
do not understand this Dhamma and Discipline. I understand this
Dhamma and Discipline. How could you understand this Dhamma and
Discipline? Your way is wrong. My way is right. I am consistent. You
are inconsistent. What should have been said first, you said last.
What should have been said last, you said first. What you had so
carefully thought up has been turned inside out. Your doctrine is
refuted. You are proved wrong. Go and learn better, or disentangle
yourself if you can!" Thus Purana Kassapa is not honoured,
respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples, nor do his
disciples live in dependence on him, honouring and respecting him.
Indeed, he is scorned by the scorn shown to his Dhamma.' [4]</P>
<P  >"And
some said this: 'This Makkhali Gosala ... this Ajita Kesakambalin ...
this Pakudha Kaccayana ... this Sanjaya Belatthiputta ... this
Nigantha Nataputta is the head of an order ... [but he] is not
honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples, nor do
his disciples live in dependence on him, honouring and respecting
him. Indeed, he is scorned by the scorn shown to his Dhamma.'</P>
<P  >"And
some said this: 'This recluse Gotama is the head of an order, the
head of a group, the teacher of a group, the wellknown and famous
founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint. He is honoured,
respected, revered, and venerated by his disciples, and his disciples
live in dependence on him, honouring and respecting him. Once the
recluse Gotama was teaching his Dhamma to an assembly of several
hundred followers and there a certain disciple of his cleared his
throat. Thereupon one of his companions in the holy life nudged him
with his knee [to indicate]: [5] "Be quiet, venerable sir, make no
noise; the Blessed One, the Teacher, is teaching us the Dhamma."
When the recluse Gotama is teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of
several hundred followers, on that occasion there is no sound of his
disciples' coughing or clearing their throats. For then that large
assembly is poised in expectancy: "Let us hear the Dhamma the
Blessed One is about to teach." Just as though a man were at a
crossroads pressing out pure honey and a large group of people were
poised in expectancy, so too, when the recluse Gotama is teaching the
Dhamma to an assembly of several hundred followers, on that occasion
there is no sound of his disciples' coughing or clearing their
throats. For then that large assembly is poised in expectancy: "Let
us hear the Dhamma the Blessed One is about to teach." And even
those disciples of his who fall out with their companions in the holy
life and abandon the training to return to the low life - even they
praise the Master and the Dhamma and the Sangha; they blame
themselves instead of others, saying: "We were unlucky, we have
little merit; for though we went forth into homelessness in such a
well-proclaimed Dhamma, we were unable to live the perfect and pure
holy life for the rest of our lives." Having become monastery
attendants or lay followers, they undertake and observe the five
precepts. Thus the recluse Gotama is honoured, respected, revered,
and venerated by his disciples, and his disciples live in dependence
on him, honouring and respecting him.'"</P>
<P  >7.
"But, Udayin, how many qualities do you see in me because of which
my disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in
dependence on me, honouring and respecting me?"</P>
<P  >8.
"Venerable sir, I see five qualities in the Blessed One because of
which his disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate him, and
live in dependence on him, honouring and respecting him. What are the
five? First, venerable sir, the Blessed One eats little and commends
eating little; this I see as the first quality of the Blessed One
because of which his disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate
him, and live in dependence on him, honouring and respecting him. [6]
Again, venerable sir, the Blessed One is content with any kind of
robe and commends contentment with any kind of robe; this I see as
the second quality of the Blessed One ... Again, venerable sir, the
Blessed One is content with any kind of almsfood and commends
contentment with any kind of almsfood; this I see as the third
quality of the Blessed One ... Again, venerable sir, the Blessed One
is content with any kind of resting place and commends contentment
with any kind of resting place; this I see as the fourth quality of
the Blessed One ... Again, venerable sir, the Blessed One is secluded
and commends seclusion; this I see as the fifth quality of the
Blessed One ... Venerable sir, these are the five qualities I see in
the Blessed One because of which his disciples honour, respect,
revere, and venerate him, and live in dependence on him, honouring
and respecting him."</P>
<P  >9.
"Suppose, Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and
venerated me, and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting
me, with the thought: 'The recluse Gotama eats little and commends
eating little.' Now there are disciples of mine who live on a
cupful or half a cupful of food, a bilva fruit's or half a bilva
fruit's quantity of food, [7] while I sometimes eat the full
contents of my almsbowl or even more. So if my disciples honoured
me-with the thought: 'The recluse Gotama eats little and commends
eating little,' then those disciples of mine who live on a cupful
of food ... should not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for
this quality, nor should they live in dependence on me, honouring and
respecting me.</P>
<P  >"Suppose,
Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me,
and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the
thought: 'The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe and
commends contentment with any kind of robe.' Now there are
disciples of mine who are refuse-rag wearers, wearers of coarse
robes; they collect rags from the charnel ground, rubbish heaps, or
shops, make them into patched robes, and wear them. But I sometimes
wear robes given by householders, robes so fine that pumpkin hair is
coarse in comparison. So if my disciples honoured me ... with the
thought: 'The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe and
commends contentment with any kind of robe,' then those disciples
of mine who are refuse-rag wearers, wearers of coarse robes ...
should not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality,
nor should they live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting
me.</P>
<P  >"Suppose,
Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me,
and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the
thought: 'The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of almsfood
and commends contentment with any kind of almsfood.' Now there are
disciples of mine who are almsfood eaters, who go on unbroken
alm.sround from house to house, who delight in gathering their food;
when they have entered among the houses they will not consent even
when invited to sit down. But I sometimes eat on invitation meals of
choice rice [8] and many sauces and curries. So if my disciples
honoured me ... with the thought: 'The recluse Gotama is content
with any kind of almsfood and commends contentment with any kind of
almsfood,' then those disciples of mine who are almsfood eaters ...
should not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality,
nor should they live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting
me.</P>
<P  >"Suppose,
Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me,
and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the
thought: 'The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of resting
place and commends contentment with any kind of resting place.' Now
there are disciples of mine who are tree-root dwellers and open-air
dwellers, who do not use a roof for eight months [of the year], while
I sometimes live in gabled mansions plastered within and without,
protected against the wind, secured by door bolts, with shuttered
windows. So if my disciples honoured me ... with the thought: 'The
recluse Gotama is content with any kind of resting place and commends
contentment with any kind of resting place,' then those disciples
of mine who are tree-root dwellers and open-air dwellers ... should
not honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality, nor
should they live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me.</P>
<P  >"Suppose,
Udayin, my disciples honoured, respected, revered, and venerated me,
and lived in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me, with the
thought: 'The recluse Gotama is secluded and commends seclusion.'
Now there are disciples of mine who are forest dwellers, dwellers in
remote resting places, who live withdrawn in remote jungle-thicket
resting places and return to the midst of the Sangha once each
half-month for the recitation of the Patimokkha. But I sometimes live
surrounded by bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, by men and women lay
followers, by kings and kings' ministers, by other sectarians and
their disciples. So if my disciples honoured me ... with the thought:
'The recluse Gotama is secluded and commends seclusion,' [9] then
those disciples of mine who are forest dwellers ... should not
honour, respect, revere, and venerate me for this quality, nor should
they live in dependence on me, honouring and respecting me. Thus,
Udayin, it is not because of these five qualities that my disciples
honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in dependence on
me, honouring and respecting me.</P>
<P  >10.
"However, Udayin, there are five other qualities because of which
my disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in
dependence on me, honouring and respecting me. What are the five?</P>
<H3 >(I. THE HIGHER VIRTUE)</H3>
<P  >11.
"Here, Udayin, my disciples esteem me for the higher virtue thus:
'The recluse Gotama is virtuous, he possesses the supreme aggregate
of virtue.' This is the first quality because of which my disciples
honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in dependence on
me, honouring and respecting me.</P>
<H3 >(II. KNOWLEDGE AND VISION)</H3>
<P  >12.
"Again, Udayin, my disciples esteem me for my excellent knowledge
and vision thus: 'When the recluse Gotama says "I know," he
truly knows; when he says "I see," he truly sees. The recluse
Gotama teaches the Dhamma through direct knowledge, not without
direct knowledge; he teaches the Dhamma with a sound basis, not
without a sound basis; he teaches the Dhamma in a convincing manner,
not in an unconvincing manner.' This is the second quality because
of which [10] my disciples honour me ...</P>
<H3 >(III. THE HIGHER WISDOM)</H3>
<P  >13.
"Again, Udayin, my disciples esteem me for the higher wisdom thus:
'The recluse Gotama is wise; he possesses the supreme aggregate of
wisdom. It is impossible that he should not foresee the future
courses of doctrine<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote761anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote761sym"><SUP>dcclxi</SUP></A></SUP>
or that he should not be able to confute with reasons the current
doctrines of others.' What do you think, Udayin? Would my
disciples, knowing and seeing thus, break in and interrupt me?" -
"No, venerable sir." - "I do not expect instruction from my
disciples; invariably, it is my disciples who expect instruction from
me. This is the third quality because of which my disciples honour me
...</P>
<H3 >(IV. THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS)</H3>
<P  >14.
"Again, Udayin, when my disciples have met with suffering and
become victims of suffering, prey to suffering, they come to me and
ask me about the noble truth of suffering. Being asked, I explain to
them the noble truth of suffering, and I satisfy their minds with my
explanation. They ask me about the noble truth of the origin of
suffering ... about the noble truth of the cessation of suffering ...
about the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering. Being asked, I explain to them the noble truth of the way
leading to the cessation of suffering, and I satisfy their minds with
my explanation. This is the fourth quality [11] because of which my
disciples honour me ...</P>
<H3 >(V. THE WAY TO DEVELOP WHOLESOME STATES)</H3>
<H4 >(1. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness)</H4>
<P  >15.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the four foundations of mindfulness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote762anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote762sym"><SUP>dcclxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body, ardent, fully
aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the
world. He abides contemplating feelings as feelings ... He abides
contemplating mind as mind ... He abides contemplating mind-objects
as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away
covetousness and grief for the world. And thereby many disciples of
mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote763anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote763sym"><SUP>dcclxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H4 >(2. The Four Right Kinds of Striving)</H4>
<P  >16.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the four right kinds of striving. Here a bhikkhu awakens zeal
for the non-arising of unarisen evil unwholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. He awakens zeal
for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome states ... He awakens
zeal for the arising of unarisen wholesome states ... He awakens zeal
for the continuance, non-disappearance, strengthening, increase, and
fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. And thereby
many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and
perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(3. The Four Bases for Spiritual Power)</H4>
<P  >17.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the four bases for spiritual power. Here a bhikkhu develops
the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to zeal
and determined striving. He develops the basis for spiritual power
consisting in concentration due to energy and determined striving. He
develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration
due to [purity of] mind and determined striving. He develops the
basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to
investigation and determined striving. And thereby many disciples of
mine abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(4. The Five Faculties)</H4>
<P  >18.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the five spiritual faculties. Here [12] a bhikkhu develops
the faculty of faith, which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment.
He develops the faculty of energy ... the faculty of mindfulness ...
the faculty of concentration ... the faculty of wisdom, which leads
to peace, leads to enlightenment. And thereby many disciples of mine
abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(5. The Five Powers)</H4>
<P  >19.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the five powers. Here a bhikkhu develops the power of faith,
which leads to peace, leads to enlightenment. He develops the power
of energy ... the power of mindfulness ... the power of concentration
... the power of wisdom, which leads to peace, leads to
enlightenment. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having
reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(6. The Seven Enlightenment Factors)</H4>
<P  >20.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the seven enlightenment factors. Here a bhikkhu develops the
mindfulness enlightenment factor, which is supported by seclusion,
dispassion, and cessation, and results in relinquishment. He develops
the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor ... the energy
enlightenment factor ... the rapture enlightenment factor ... the
tranquillity enlightenment factor ... the concentration enlightenment
factor ... the equanimity enlightenment factor, which is supported by
seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and results in relinquishment.
And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(7. The Noble Eightfold Path)</H4>
<P  >21.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the Noble Eightfold Path. Here a bhikkhu develops right view,
right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. And thereby many
disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and
perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(8. The Eight Liberations)</H4>
<P  >22.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the eight liberations.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote764anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote764sym"><SUP>dcclxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Possessed of material form, one sees forms: this is the first
liberation. Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms
externally: this is the second liberation. One is resolved only upon
the beautiful: this is the third liberation. [13] With the complete
surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of
perceptions of sensory impact, with non-attention to perceptions of
diversity, aware that 'space is infinite,' one enters upon and
abides in the base of infinite space: this is the fourth liberation.
By completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware that
'consciousness is infinite,' one enters upon and abides in the
base of infinite consciousness: this is the fifth liberation. By
completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness, aware that
'there is nothing,' one enters upon and abides in the base of
nothingness: this is the sixth liberation. By completely surmounting
the base of nothingness, one enters upon and abides in the base of
neither-perception-nornon-perception: this is the seventh liberation.
By completely surmounting the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, one enters upon and abides in
the cessation of perception and feeling: this is the eighth
liberation. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached
the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(9. The Eight Bases for Transcendence)</H4>
<P  >23.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the eight bases for transcendence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote765anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote765sym"><SUP>dcclxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, limited, fair
and ugly; by transcending them, one perceives thus: I know, I see.'
This is the first base for transcendence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote766anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote766sym"><SUP>dcclxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, immeasurable,
fair and ugly; by transcending them, one perceives thus: 'I know, I
see.' This is the second base for transcendence. Not perceiving
form internally, one sees forms externally, limited, fair and ugly;
by transcending them, one perceives thus: 'I know, I see.' This
is the third base for transcendence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote767anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote767sym"><SUP>dcclxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally,
immeasurable, fair and ugly; by transcending them, one perceives
thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the fourth base for transcendence.
Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, blue, of
blue colour, blue in appearance, with blue luminosity. Just like a
flax flower, which is blue, of blue colour, blue in appearance, with
blue luminosity, or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides,
which is blue, of blue colour, blue in appearance, with blue
luminosity; so too, not perceiving form internally, one sees forms
externally ... with blue luminosity; by transcending them, one
perceives thus: 'I know, I see.' This is the fifth [14] base for
transcendence. Not perceiving form internally, one sees forms
externally, yellow, of yellow colour, yellow in appearance, with
yellow luminosity. Just like a kannikara flower, which is yellow, of
yellow colour, yellow in appearance, with yellow luminosity, or just
like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides, which is yellow, of
yellow colour, yellow in appearance, with yellow luminosity; so too,
not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally ... with
yellow luminosity; by transcending them, one perceives thus: 'I
know, I see.' This is the sixth base for transcendence. Not
perceiving form externally, one sees forms externally, red, of red
colour, red in appearance, with red luminosity. Just like a hibiscus
flower, which is red, of red colour, red in appearance, with red
luminosity, or just like Benares cloth smoothened on both sides,
which is red, of red colour, red in appearance, with red luminosity;
so too, not perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally ...
with red luminosity; by transcending them, one perceives thus: 'I
know, I see.' This is the seventh base for transcendence. Not
perceiving form internally, one sees forms externally, white, of
white colour, white in appearance, with white luminosity. Just like
the morning star, which is white, of white colour, white in
appearance, with white luminosity, or just like Benares cloth
smoothened on both sides, which is white, of white colour, white in
appearance, with white luminosity; so too, not perceiving form
internally, one sees forms externally ... with white luminosity; by
transcending them, one perceives thus: 'I know, I see.' This is
the eighth base for transcendence. And thereby many disciples of mine
abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(10. The Ten Kasinas)</H4>
<P  >24.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the ten kasina bases.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote768anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote768sym"><SUP>dcclxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
One contemplates the earth kasina above, below, and across, undivided
and immeasurable. Another contemplates the water-kasina ... Another
contemplates the fire-kasina ... Another contemplates the air-kasina
... Another contemplates the blue-kasina ... Another contemplates the
yellow-kasina ... Another contemplates the red-kasina ... Another
contemplates the white-kasina ... Another contemplates the
space-kasina ... Another contemplates the consciousness-kasina [15]
above, below, and across, undivided and immeasurable. And thereby
many disciples of mine abide having reached the perfection and
consummation of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(11. The Four Jhanas)</H4>
<P  >25.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
develop the four jhanas. Here, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in
the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He makes the
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and
pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote769anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote769sym"><SUP>dcclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as a skilled bath man or a bath man's apprentice heaps bath
powder in a metal basin and, sprinkling it gradually with water,
kneads it till the moisture wets his ball of bath powder, soaks it
and pervades it inside and out, yet the ball itself does not ooze; so
too, a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion.</P>
<P  >26.
"Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has
self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. He makes
the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench, steep, fill,
and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration. Just as
though there were a lake whose waters welled up from below and it had
no inflow from east, west, north, or south [16] and would not be
replenished from time to time by showers of rain, then the cool fount
of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench,
steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that there would be no part of
the whole lake unpervaded by cool water; so too, a bhikkhu makes the
rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench, steep, fill, and
pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of concentration.</P>
<P  >27.
"Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu abides
in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure
with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on
account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abiding
who has equanimity and is mindful.' He makes</P>
<P  >the
pleasure divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this
body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the
pleasure divested of rapture. Just as in a pond of blue or red or
white lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water
thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and cool water
drenches, steeps, fills, and pervades them to their tips and their
roots, so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by
cool water; so too, a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapture.</P>
<P  >28.
"Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana, which has neitherpain-nor-pleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. He sits pervading this body
with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the pure bright mind. Just as though a man were sitting
covered from the head down with a white cloth, so that there would be
no part of his whole body not covered by the white cloth; so too, a
bhikkhu sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so that
there is no part of his whole body [17] unpervaded by the pure bright
mind. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(12. Insight Knowledge)</H4>
<P  >29.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
understand thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote770anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote770sym"><SUP>dcclxx</SUP></A></SUP>
'This body of mine, made of material form, consisting of the four
great elements, procreated by a mother and father, and built up out
of boiled rice and porridge, is subject to impermanence, to being
worn and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration, and this
consciousness of mine is supported by it and bound up with it.'
Suppose there were a beautiful beryl gem of purest water,
eight-faceted, well cut, clear and limpid, possessed of all good
qualities, and through it a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread
would be strung. Then a man with good sight, taking it in his hand,
might review it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of purest
water, eight-faceted, well cut, clear and limpid, possessed of all
good qualities, and</P>
<P  >through
it is strung a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.' So too,
I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to understand thus: 'This
body of mine ... is subject to impermanence, to being worn and rubbed
away, to dissolution and disintegration, and this consciousness of
mine is supported by it and bound up with it.' And thereby many
disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and
perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(13. The Mind-made Body)</H4>
<P  >30.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to create
from this body another body having form, mind-made, with all its
limbs, lacking no faculty. Just as though a man were to pull out a
reed from its sheath and think thus: 'This is the sheath, this is
the reed; the sheath is one, the reed is another; it is from the
sheath that the reed has been pulled out'; or just as though a man
were to pull out a sword from its scabbard and think thus: 'This is
the sword, this is the scabbard; the sword is one, the scabbard
another; it is from the scabbard that the sword has been pulled out';
[18] or just as though a man were to pull a snake out of its slough
and think thus: 'This is the snake, this is the slough; the snake
is one, the slough another; it is from the slough that the snake has
been pulled out.' So too, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way
to create from this body another body having form, mind-made, with
all its limbs, lacking no faculty. And thereby many disciples of mine
abide having reached the consummation and perfection of direct
knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(14. The Kinds of Supernormal Power)</H4>
<P  >31.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to wield
the various kinds of supernormal power: having been one, they become
many; having been many, they become one; they appear and vanish; they
go unhindered through walls, through enclosures, through mountains,
as though through space; they dive in and out of the earth as though
it were water; they walk on water without sinking as though it were
earth; seated cross-legged, they travel in space like birds; with
their hands they touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and
mighty; they wield bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-world.
Just</P>
<P  >as
a skilled potter or his apprentice might create and fashion out of
well-prepared clay any shape of pot he wished; or just as a skilled
ivory-worker or his apprentice might create and fashion out of
well-prepared ivory any ivory work of art he wished; or just as a
skilled goldsmith or his apprentice might create and fashion out of
well-prepared gold any gold work of art he wished; so too, I have
proclaimed to my disciples the way to wield the various kinds of
supernormal power ... [19] ... they wield bodily mastery even as far
as the Brahma-world. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having
reached the consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(15. The Divine Ear Element)</H4>
<P  >32.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby
with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the
human, they hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human,
those that are far as well as near. Just as a vigorous trumpeter
might make himself heard without difficulty in the four quarters; so
too, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the
divine ear element ... far as well as near. And thereby many
disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and
perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(16. Understanding the Minds of Others)</H4>
<P  >33.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
understand the minds of other beings, of other persons, having
encompassed them with their own minds. They understand a mind
affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as
unaffected by lust; they understand a mind affected by hate as
affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate;
they understand a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion
and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; they
understand a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as
distracted; they understand an exalted mind as exalted and an
unexalted mind as unexalted; they understand a surpassed mind as
surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; they understand a
concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as
unconcentrated; they understand</P>
<P  >a
liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated.
Just as a man or a woman - young, youthful, and fond of ornaments -
on viewing the image of his or her own face in a clean bright mirror
or in a bowl of clear water, would know if there were a spot thus:
'There is a spot,' [20] or would know if there were no spot thus:
'There is no spot'; so too, I have proclaimed to my disciples the
way to understand ... an unliberated mind as unliberated. And thereby
many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation and
perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(17. The Recollection of Past Lives)</H4>
<P  >34.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way to
recollect their manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births,
three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births,
thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a
thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of
world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of
world-contraction and expansion: 'There I was so named, of such a
clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my
experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away
from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named ...
and passing away from there, I reappeared here.' Thus with their
aspects and particulars they recollect their manifold past lives.
Just as a man might go from his own village to another village and
then back again to his own village. He might think: 'I went from my
own village to that village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in
such a way, spoke in such a way, kept silent in such a way; and from
that village I went to that other village and there [21] I stood in
such a way ... kept silent in such a way; and from that village I
came back again to my own village.' So too, I have proclaimed to my
disciples the way to recollect their manifold lives ... Thus with
their aspects and particulars they recollect their manifold past
lives. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<H4 >(18. The Divine Eye)</H4>
<P  >35.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby
with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, they
see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair
and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. They understand how beings pass
on according to their actions thus: 'These worthy beings who were
ill-conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones,
wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions,
on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a
state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in
hell; but these worthy beings who were well-conducted in body,
speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views,
giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in
the heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified
and surpasses the human, they see beings passing away and
reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and
unfortunate, and they understand how beings pass on according to
their actions. Just as though there were two houses with doors and a
man with good sight standing there between them saw people entering
the houses and coming out and passing to and fro. So too, I have
proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby with the divine eye ...
They understand how beings pass on according to their actions. And
thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the consummation
and perfection of direct knowledge. [22]</P>
<H4 >(19. The Destruction of the Taints)</H4>
<P  >36.
"Again, Udayin, I have proclaimed to my disciples the way whereby
by realising for themselves with direct knowledge, they here and now
enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by
wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints. Just as
if there were a lake in a mountain recess, clear, limpid, and
undisturbed, so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could
see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming
about and resting. He might think: 'There is this lake, clear,
limpid, and undisturbed, and there are</P>
<P  >these
shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming
about and resting.' So too, I have proclaimed to my disciples the
way whereby by realising for themselves with direct knowledge, they
here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and
deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the
taints. And thereby many disciples of mine abide having reached the
consummation and perfection of direct knowledge.</P>
<P  >37.
"This, Udayin, is the fifth quality because of which my disciples
honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in dependence on
me, honouring and respecting me.</P>
<P  >38.
"These, Udayin, are the five qualities because of which my
disciples honour, respect, revere, and venerate me, and live in
dependence on me, honouring and respecting me."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The wanderer Udayin was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
