98. Vasettha Sutta - To Vasettha</H2>
<P  >[115]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote900anc" HREF="#sdendnote900sym"><SUP>cm</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Icchanangala, in the
wood near Icchanangala.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion a number of well-known, well-to-do brahmins were
staying at Icchanangala, that is, the brahmin Cank3, the brahmin
Tarukkha, the brahmin Pokkharasati, the brahmin Janussoni, the
brahmin Todeyya, and other wellknown, well-to-do brahmins.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, while the brahmin students Vasettha and Bharadvaja were walking
and wandering for exercise, this discussion arose between them: "How
is one a brahmin?" The brahmin student Bharadvaja said: "When one
is well-born on both sides, of pure maternal and paternal descent
seven generations back, unassailable and impeccable in respect of
birth, then one is a brahmin." The brahmin student Vasettha said:
"When one is virtuous and fulfils the observances, then one is a
brahmin."</P>
<P  >4.
But the brahmin student Bharadvaja could not [116] convince the
brahmin student Vasettha, nor could the brahmin student Vasettha
convince the brahmin student Bharadvaja.</P>
<P  >5.
Then the brahmin student Vasettha addressed the brahmin student
Bharadvaja: "Sir, the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who
went forth from a Sakyan clan, is living at Icchanangala, in the wood
near Icchanangala. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread
to this effect: 'That Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower
of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of
gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.' Come, Bharadvaja, let us go
to the recluse Gotama and ask him about this matter. As he answers,
so we will remember it." - "Yes, sir," the brahmin student
Bharadvaja replied.</P>
<P  >6.
Then the two brahmin students, Vasettha and Bharadvaja, went to the
Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, they sat down at one side and the brahmin
student Vasettha addressed the Blessed One in stanzas thus:</P>
<P  >7.
Vasettha</P>
<P >
1. "We are both acknowledged to possess</P>
<P >
The knowledge we claim of the Triple Veda,</P>
<P >
For I am Pokkharasati's pupil</P>
<P >
And he a pupil of Tarukkha.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
2. We have attained full mastery</P>
<P >
Over all that the Vedic experts teach;</P>
<P >
Skilled in philology and grammar</P>
<P >
We match our teachers in discussion. [117]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
3. A dispute has arisen between us, Gotama,</P>
<P >
Concerning the question of birth and class:</P>
<P >
Bharadvaja says one is a brahmin by birth,</P>
<P >
While I hold one is a brahmin by action.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote901anc" HREF="#sdendnote901sym"><SUP>cmi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
Know this, O Seer, as our debate.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
4. Since neither of us could convince the other,</P>
<P >
Or make him see his point of view,</P>
<P >
We have come to ask you, sir,</P>
<P >
Widely famed to be a Buddha.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
5. As people turn with palms upraised</P>
<P >
Towards the moon when it reaches fullness,</P>
<P >
So in the world do they venerate you</P>
<P >
And pay homage to you, Gotama.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
6. So now we ask of you, Gotama,</P>
<P >
The eye uprisen in the world:</P>
<P >
Is one a brahmin by birth or action?</P>
<P >
Explain to us who do not know</P>
<P >
How we should recognise a brahmin."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >8.
Buddha</P>
<P >
7. "I will explain to you as they really are,</P>
<P >
Vasettha," said the Blessed One,</P>
<P >
"The generic divisions of living beings;</P>
<P >
For many are the kinds of birth.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
8. Know first the grass and trees:</P>
<P >
Though they lack self-awareness,</P>
<P >
Their birth is their distinctive mark;</P>
<P >
For many are the kinds of birth. [118]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
9. Next come the moths and butterflies</P>
<P >
And so on through as far as ants:</P>
<P >
Their birth is their distinctive mark;</P>
<P >
For many are the kinds of birth.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
10. Then know the kinds of quadrupeds</P>
<P >
[Of varied sorts] both small and large:</P>
<P >
Their birth is their distinctive mark;</P>
<P >
For many are the kinds of birth.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
11. Know those whose bellies are their feet,</P>
<P >
To wit, the long-backed class of snakes:</P>
<P >
Their birth is their distinctive mark;</P>
<P >
For many are the kinds of birth.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
12. Know too the water-dwelling fish</P>
<P >
That pasture in the liquid world:</P>
<P >
Their birth is their distinctive mark;</P>
<P >
For many are the kinds of birth.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
13. Next know the birds that wing their way</P>
<P >
As they range in open skies:</P>
<P >
Their birth is their distinctive mark;</P>
<P >
For many are the kinds of birth.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >9.</P>
<P >
14. "While in these births the differences</P>
<P >
Of birth make their distinctive mark,</P>
<P >
With humans no differences of birth</P>
<P >
Make a distinctive mark in them.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
15. Nor in the hairs nor in the head</P>
<P >
Nor in the ears nor in the eyes</P>
<P >
Nor in the mouth nor in the nose</P>
<P >
Nor in the lips nor in the brows;</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
16. Nor in the shoulders or the neck</P>
<P >
Nor in the belly or the back</P>
<P >
Nor in the buttocks or the breast</P>
<P >
Nor in the anus or genitals;</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
17. Nor in the hands nor in the feet</P>
<P >
Nor in the fingers or the nails</P>
<P >
Nor in the knees nor in the thighs</P>
<P >
Nor in their colour or in voice:</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Here birth makes no distinctive mark</P>
<P >
As with the other kinds of birth. [119]</P>
<P >
18. In human bodies in themselves</P>
<P >
Nothing distinctive can be found.</P>
<P >
Distinction among human beings</P>
<P >
Is purely verbal designation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote902anc" HREF="#sdendnote902sym"><SUP>cmii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

When this was said, the brahmin students Vasettha and Bharadvaja said
