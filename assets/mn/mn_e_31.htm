31. Culagosinga Sutta - The Shorter Discourse in Gosinga</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Nadika in the Brick House.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya,
and the venerable Kimbila were living at the Park of the Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote354anc" HREF="#sdendnote354sym"><SUP>cccliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and
went to the Park of the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood. The park keeper saw
the Blessed One coming in the distance and told him: “Do not enter
this park, recluse. There are three clansmen here seeking their own
good. Do not disturb them.”</P>
<P  >4.
The venerable Anuruddha heard the park keeper speaking to the Blessed
One and told him: “Friend park keeper, do not keep the Blessed One
out. It is our Teacher, the Blessed One, who has come.” Then the
venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Nandiya and the venerable
Kimbila and said: “Come out, venerable sirs, come out! Our Teacher,
[206] the Blessed One, has come.”</P>
<P  >5.
Then all three went to meet the Blessed One. One took his bowl and
outer robe, one prepared a seat, and one set out water for washing
the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready and washed
his feet. Then those three venerable ones paid homage to the Blessed
One and sat down at one side. When they were seated, the Blessed One
said to them: “I hope you are all keeping well, Anuruddha, I hope
you are all comfortable, I hope you are not having any trouble
getting almsfood.”</P>
<P  >“We
are keeping well, Blessed One, we are comfortable, and we are not
having any trouble getting almsfood.”</P>
<P  >6.
“1 hope, Anuruddha, that you are all living in concord, with mutual
appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water,
viewing each other with kindly eyes.”</P>
<P  >“Surely,
venerable sir, we are living in concord, with mutual appreciation,
without disputing, blending like milk and water, viewing each other
with kindly eyes.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Anuruddha, how do you live thus?”</P>
<P  >7.
“Venerable sir, as to that, I think thus: ‘It is a gain for me,
it is a great gain for me, that I am living with such companions in
the holy life.’ I maintain bodily acts of loving-kindness towards
those venerable ones both openly and privately; I maintain verbal
acts of loving-kindness towards them both openly and privately; I
maintain mental acts of loving-kindness towards them both openly and
privately.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote355anc" HREF="#sdendnote355sym"><SUP>ccclv</SUP></A></SUP>
I consider: ‘Why should I not [207] set aside what I wish to do and
do what these venerable ones wish to do?’ Then I set aside what I
wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do. We are
different in body, venerable sir, but one in mind.”</P>
<P  >The
venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila each spoke likewise,
adding: “That is how, venerable sir, we are living in concord, with
mutual appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water,
viewing each other with kindly eyes.”</P>
<P  >8.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. I hope that you all abide diligent, ardent,
and resolute.”</P>
<P  >“Surely,
venerable sir, we abide diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</P>
<P  >“But,
Anuruddha, how do you abide thus?”</P>
<P  >9.
“Venerable sir, as to that, whichever of us returns first from the
village with almsfood prepares the seats, sets out the water for
drinking and for washing, and puts the refuse bucket in its place.
Whichever of us returns last eats any food left over, if he wishes;
otherwise he throws it away where there is no greenery or drops it
into water where there is no life. He puts away the seats and the
water for drinking and for washing. He puts away the refuse bucket
after washing it and he sweeps out the refectory. Whoever notices
that the pots of water for drinking, washing, or the latrine are low
or empty takes care of them. If they are too heavy for him, he calls
someone else by a signal of the hand and they move it by joining
hands, but because of this we do not break out into speech. But every
five days we sit together all night discussing the Dhamma. That is
how we abide diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</P>
<P  >10.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. But while you abide thus diligent, ardent,
and resolute, have you attained any superhuman state, a distinction
in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable
abiding?”</P>
<P  >“Why
not, venerable sir? Here, venerable sir, whenever we want, quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, we
enter upon and abide in the first jhana, which is accompanied by
applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion. Venerable sir, this is a superhuman state, a distinction
in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable
abiding, which we have attained while abiding diligent, ardent, and
resolute.”</P>
<P  >11-13.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. But is there any other superhuman state, a
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a
comfortable abiding, which you have attained by surmounting that
abiding, [208] by making that abiding subside?”</P>
<P  >“Why
not, venerable sir? Here, venerable sir, whenever we want, with the
stilling of applied and sustained thought, we enter upon and abide in
the second jhana … With the fading away as well of rapture … we
enter upon and abide in the third jhana … With the abandoning of
pleasure and pain … we enter upon and abide in the fourth jhana …
Venerable sir, this is another superhuman state, a distinction in
knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable abiding,
which we have attained by surmounting the preceding abiding, by
making that abiding subside.”</P>
<P  >14.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. But is there any other superhuman state …
which you have attained by surmounting that abiding, by making that
abiding subside?”</P>
<P  >“Why
not, venerable sir? Here, venerable sir, whenever we want, with the
complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance
of perceptions of sensory impact, with non-attention to perceptions
of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite,’ [209] we enter upon
and abide in the base of infinite space. Venerable sir, this is
another superhuman state … which we have attained by surmounting
the preceding abiding, by making that abiding subside.”</P>
<P  >15-17.
“Good, good, Anuruddha. But is there any other superhuman state …
which you have attained by surmounting that abiding, by making that
abiding subside?”</P>
<P  >“Why
not, venerable sir? Here, venerable sir, whenever we want, by
completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware that
‘consciousness is infinite,’ we enter upon and abide in the base
of infinite consciousness … By completely surmounting the base of
infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ we enter
upon and abide in the base of nothingness … By completely
surmounting the base of nothingness, we enter upon and abide in the
base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Venerable sir, this is
another superhuman state … which we have attained by surmounting
the preceding abiding, by making that abiding subside.”</P>
<P  >18.
“Good, good Anuruddha. But is there any other superhuman state, a
distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a
comfortable abiding, which you have attained by surmounting that
abiding, by making that abiding subside?”</P>
<P  >“Why
not, venerable sir? Here, venerable sir, whenever we want, by
completely surmounting the base of
neither-perceptionnor-non-perception, we enter upon and abide in the
cessation of perception and feeling. And our taints are destroyed by
our seeing with wisdom. Venerable sir, this is another superhuman
state, a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble
ones, a comfortable abiding, which we have attained by surmounting
the preceding abiding, by making that abiding subside. And, venerable
sir, we do not see any other comfortable abiding higher or more
sublime than this one.”</P>
<P  >“Good,
good Anuruddha. There is no other comfortable abiding higher or more
sublime than that one.”</P>
<P  >19.
Then, when the Blessed One had instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, and the
venerable Kimbila with a talk on the Dhamma, he rose from his seat
and departed.</P>
<P  >20.
After they had accompanied the Blessed One a little way and turned
back again, the venerable [210] Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila
asked the venerable Anuruddha: “Have we ever reported to the
venerable Anuruddha that we have obtained those abidings and
attainments that the venerable Anuruddha, in the Blessed One’s
presence, ascribed to us up to the destruction of the taints?”</P>
<P  >“The
venerable ones have never reported to me that they have obtained
those abidings and attainments. Yet by encompassing the venerable
ones’ minds with my own mind, I know that they have obtained those
abidings and attainments. And deities have also reported to me:
‘These venerable ones have obtained those abidings and
attainments.’ Then I declared it when directly questioned by the
Blessed One.”</P>
<P  >21.
Then the spirit Digha Parajana<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote356anc" HREF="#sdendnote356sym"><SUP>ccclvi</SUP></A></SUP>
went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, he
stood at one side and said: “It is a gain for the Vajjians,
venerable sir, a great gain for the Vajjian people that the
Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened, dwells among them and
these three clansmen, the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya,
and the venerable Kimbila!” On hearing the exclamation of the
spirit Digha Parajana, the earth gods exclaimed: “It is a gain for
the Vajjians, a great gain for the Vajjian people that the Tathagata,
accomplished and fully enlightened, dwells among them and these three
clansmen, the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, and the
venerable Kimbila!” On hearing the exclamation of the earth gods,
the gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings … the gods of the
heaven of the Thirty-three … the Yama gods … the gods of the
Tusita heaven … the gods who delight in creating … the gods who
wield power over others’ creations … the gods of Brahma’s
retinue exclaimed: “It is a gain for the Vajjians, a great gain for
the Vajjian people that the Tathagata, accomplished and fully
enlightened, dwells among them and these three clansmen, the
venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, and the venerable
Kimbila!” Thus at that instant, at that moment, those venerable
ones were known as far as the Brahma-world.</P>
<P  >22.
[The Blessed One said:] “So it is, Digha, so it is! And if the clan
from which those three clansmen went forth from the home life into
homelessness should remember them with confident heart, that would
lead to the welfare and happiness of that clan for a long time. And
if the retinue of the clan from which those three clansmen went forth
[211] … the village from which they went forth … the town from
which they went forth … the city from which they went forth … the
country from which those three clansmen went forth from the home life
into homelessness should remember them with confident heart, that
would lead to the welfare and happiness of that country for a long
time. If all nobles should remember those three clansmen with
confident heart, that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the
nobles for a long time. If all brahmins … all merchants … all
workers should remember those three clansmen with confident heart,
that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the workers for a
long time. If the world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas,
this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its
people, should remember those three clansmen with confident heart,
that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long
time. See, Digha, how those three clansmen are practising for the
welfare and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world,
for the good, welfare and happiness of gods and humans.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The spirit Digha Parajana was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
