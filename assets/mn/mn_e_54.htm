54. Potaliya Sutta - To Potaliya</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
country of the Anguttarapans at a town of theirs named Apana.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Apana for alms. When he had wandered
for alms in Apana and had returned from his almsround, after his meal
he went to a certain grove for the day’s abiding. Having entered
the grove, he sat down at the root of a tree.</P>
<P  >3.
Potaliya the householder, while walking and wandering for exercise,
wearing full dress with parasol and sandals, also went to the grove,
and having entered the grove, he went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he stood at one side. The Blessed One said to him:
“There are seats, householder, sit down if you like.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the householder Potaliya thought: “The recluse
Gotama addresses me as ‘householder,’“and angry and displeased,
he remained silent.</P>
<P  >A
second time the Blessed One said to him: “There are seats,
householder, sit down if you like.” And a second time the
householder Potaliya thought: “The recluse Gotama addresses me as
‘householder,’“and angry and displeased, he remained silent.</P>
<P  >A
third time the Blessed One said to him: “There are seats,
householder, sit down if you like.” When this was said, the
householder Potaliya thought: “The recluse Gotama addresses me as
‘householder,’“and angry and displeased, he said to the Blessed
One: [360] “Master Gotama, it is neither fitting nor proper that
you address me as ‘householder.’“</P>
<P  >“Householder,
you have the aspects, marks, and signs of a householder.”</P>
<P  >“Nevertheless,
Master Gotama, I have given up all my works and cut off all my
affairs.”</P>
<P  >“In
what way have you given up all your works, householder, and cut off
all your affairs?”</P>
<P  >“Master
Gotama, I have given all my wealth, grain, silver, and gold to my
children as their inheritance. Without advising or admonishing them,
I live merely on food and clothing. That is how I have given up all
my works and cut off all my affairs.”</P>
<P  >“Householder,
the cutting off of affairs as you describe it is one thing, but in
the Noble One’s Discipline the cutting off of affairs is
different.”</P>
<P  >“What
is the cutting off of affairs like in the Noble One’s Discipline,
venerable sir? It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One
would teach me the Dhamma, showing what the cutting off of affairs is
like in the Noble One’s Discipline.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, householder, and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” Potaliya the householder replied. The Blessed One
said this:</P>
<P  >4.
“Householder, there are these eight things in the Noble One’s
Discipline that lead to the cutting off of affairs. What are the
eight? With the support of the non-killing of living beings, the
killing of living beings is to be abandoned. With the support of
taking only what is given, the taking of what is not given is to be
abandoned. With the support of truthful speech, false speech is to be
abandoned. With the support of unmalicious speech, malicious speech
is to be abandoned. With the support of refraining from rapacious
greed’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote567anc" HREF="#sdendnote567sym"><SUP>dlxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
rapacious greed is to be abandoned. With the support of refraining
from spiteful scolding, spiteful scolding is to be abandoned. With
the support of refraining from angry despair, angry despair is to be
abandoned. With the support of non-arrogance, arrogance is to be
abandoned. These are the eight things, stated in brief without being
expounded in detail, that lead to the cutting off of affairs in the
Noble One’s Discipline.”</P>
<P  >5.
“Venerable sir, it would be good if, out of compassion, the Blessed
One would expound to me in detail these eight things that lead to the
cutting off of affairs in the Noble One’s Discipline, which have
been stated in brief by the Blessed One without being expounded in
detail.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, householder, and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” Potaliya the householder replied. The Blessed One
said this: [361]</P>
<P  >6.
“‘With the support of the non-killing of living beings, the
killing of living beings is to be abandoned.’ So it was said. And
with reference to what was this said? Here a noble disciple considers
thus: ‘I am practising the way to the abandoning and cutting off of
those fetters because of which I might kill living beings. If I were
to kill living beings, I would blame myself for doing so; the wise,
having investigated, would censure me for doing so; and on the
dissolution of the body, after death, because of killing living
beings an unhappy destination would be expected. But this killing of
living beings is itself a fetter and a hindrance.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote568anc" HREF="#sdendnote568sym"><SUP>dlxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
And while taints, vexation, and fever might arise through the killing
of living beings, there are no taints, vexation, and fever in one who
abstains from killing living beings.’ So it is with reference to
this that it was said: ‘With the support of the non-killing of
living beings, the killing of living beings is to be abandoned.’</P>
<P  >7.
“‘With the support of taking only what is given, the taking of
what is not given is to be abandoned.’ So it was said …</P>
<P  >8.
“‘With the support of truthful speech, false speech is to be
abandoned.’ So it was said … [362]</P>
<P  >9.
“‘With the support of unmalicious speech, malicious speech is to
be abandoned.’ So it was said …</P>
<P  >10.
“‘With the support of refraining from rapacious greed, rapacious
greed is to be abandoned.’ So it was said …</P>
<P  >11.
“‘With the support of refraining from spiteful scolding, spiteful
scolding is to be abandoned.’ So it was said … [363]</P>
<P  >12.
“‘With the support of refraining from angry despair, angry
despair is to be abandoned.’ So it was said …</P>
<P  >13.
“‘With the support of non-arrogance, arrogance is to be
abandoned.’ So it was said. And with reference to what was this
said? Here a noble disciple considers thus: ‘I am practising the
way to the abandoning and cutting off of those fetters because of
which I might be arrogant. If I were to be arrogant, I would blame
myself for this; the wise, having investigated, would censure me for
this; and on the dissolution of the body, after death, because of
being arrogant an unhappy destination would be expected. But this
arrogance is itself a fetter and a hindrance. And while taints,
vexation, and fever might arise through arrogance, there are no
taints, vexation, and fever for one who is not arrogant.’ So it is
with reference to this that it was said: ‘With the support of
non-arrogance, arrogance is to be abandoned.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote569anc" HREF="#sdendnote569sym"><SUP>dlxix</SUP></A></SUP>

<P  >14.
“These eight things that lead to the cutting off of affairs in the
Noble One’s Discipline have now been expounded in detail. But the
cutting off of affairs in the Noble One’s Discipline has not yet
been achieved entirely and in all ways.”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, how is the cutting off of affairs in the Noble One’s
Discipline achieved entirely and in all ways? It would be good,
venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma, showing
me how the cutting off of affairs in the Noble One’s Discipline is
achieved entirely and in all ways.”</P>
<P  >“Then
listen, householder, and attend closely to what I shall say.”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir,” Potaliya the householder replied. The Blessed One
said this:</P>
<P  >15.
“Householder, suppose a dog, overcome by hunger and weakness, was
waiting by a butcher’s shop.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote570anc" HREF="#sdendnote570sym"><SUP>dlxx</SUP></A></SUP>
Then a skilled butcher or his apprentice would cut out a skeleton of
meatless bones smeared with blood and toss it to the dog. What do you
think, householder? Would that dog get rid of his hunger and weakness
by gnawing such a skeleton of meatless bones smeared with blood?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because that skeleton consisted only of
meatless bones smeared with blood. Eventually that dog would reap
weariness and disappointment.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual
pleasures have been compared to a skeleton by the Blessed One; they
provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in them is
great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdom,
he avoids the equanimity that is diversified, based on diversity, and
develops the equanimity that is unified, based on unity,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote571anc" HREF="#sdendnote571sym"><SUP>dlxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
where clinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases
without remainder.</P>
<P  >16.
“Householder, suppose a vulture, a crow, or a hawk seized a piece
of meat and flew away, and then vultures, crows, and hawks flew up
and pecked and clawed it. What do you think, householder? If that
vulture, crow, or hawk does not quickly let go of that piece of meat,
wouldn’t it incur death or deadly suffering because of that?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual
pleasures have been compared to a piece of meat by the Blessed One;
they provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in
them is great.’ [365] Having seen this thus as it actually is with
proper wisdom … clinging to the material things of the world
utterly ceases without remainder.</P>
<P  >17.
“Householder, suppose a man took a blazing grass torch and went
against the wind. What do you think, householder? If that man does
not quickly let go of that blazing grass torch, wouldn’t that
blazing grass torch burn his hand or his arm or some other part of
his body, so that he might incur death or deadly suffering because of
that?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual
pleasures have been compared to a grass torch by the Blessed One;
they provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in
them is great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom … clinging to the material things of the world utterly
ceases without remainder.</P>
<P  >18.
“Householder, suppose there were a charcoal pit deeper than a man’s
height full of glowing coals without flame or smoke. Then a man came
who wanted to live and not to die, who wanted pleasure and recoiled
from pain, and two strong men seized him by both arms and dragged him
towards that charcoal pit. What do you think, householder? Would that
man twist his body this way and that?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because that man knows that if he falls
into that charcoal pit, he will incur death or deadly suffering
because of that.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual
pleasures have been compared to a charcoal pit by the Blessed One;
they provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in
them is great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom … clinging to the material things of the world utterly
ceases without remainder.</P>
<P  >19.
“Householder, suppose a man dreamt about lovely parks, lovely
groves, lovely meadows, and lovely lakes, and on waking he saw
nothing of it. So too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus:
‘Sensual pleasures have been compared to a dream by the Blessed
One; they provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger
in them is great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with
proper wisdom … clinging to the material things of the world
utterly ceases without remainder.</P>
<P  >20.
“Householder, suppose a man borrowed goods on loan [366] - a fancy
carriage and fine-jewelled earrings - and preceded and surrounded by
those borrowed goods he went to the marketplace. Then people, seeing
him, would say: ‘Sirs, that is a rich man! That is how the rich
enjoy their wealth!’ Then the owners, whenever they saw him, would
take back their things. What do you think, householder? Would that be
enough for that man to become dejected?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because the owners took back their
things.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual
pleasures have been compared to borrowed goods by the Blessed One;
they provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in
them is great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom … clinging to material things of the world utterly ceases
without remainder.</P>
<P  >21.
“Householder, suppose there were a dense grove not far from some
village or town, within which there was a tree laden with fruit but
none of its fruit had fallen to the ground. Then a man came needing
fruit, seeking fruit, wandering in search of fruit, and he entered
the grove and saw the tree laden with fruit. Thereupon he thought:
‘This tree is laden with fruit but none of its fruit has fallen to
the ground. I know how to climb a tree, so let me climb this tree,
eat as much fruit as I want, and fill my bag.’ And he did so. Then
a second man came needing fruit, seeking fruit, wandering in search
of fruit, and taking a sharp axe, he too entered the grove and saw
that tree laden with fruit. Thereupon he thought: ‘This tree is
laden with fruit but none of its fruit has fallen to the ground. I do
not know how to climb a tree, so let me cut this tree down at its
root, eat as much fruit as I want, and fill my bag.’ And he did so.
What do you think, householder? If that first man who had climbed the
tree doesn’t come down quickly, when the tree falls, wouldn’t he
break his hand or his foot or some other part of his body, [367] so
that he might incur death or deadly suffering because of that?”</P>
<P  >“Yes,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, householder, a noble disciple considers thus: ‘Sensual
pleasures have been compared to a fruit tree by the Blessed One; they
provide much suffering and much despair, while the danger in them is
great.’ Having seen this thus as it actually is with proper wisdom,
he avoids the equanimity that is diversified, based on diversity, and
develops the equanimity that is unified, based on unity, where
clinging to the material things of the world utterly ceases without
remainder.</P>
<P  >22.
“Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is
due to equanimity, this noble disciple recollects his manifold past
lives, that is, one birth, two births … (as Sutta 51, §24) …
Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold
past lives.</P>
<P  >23.
“Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is
due to equanimity, with the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, this noble disciple sees beings passing away and
reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and
unfortunate … (as Sutta 51, §25) … and he understands how beings
pass on according to their actions.</P>
<P  >24.
“Having arrived at that same supreme mindfulness whose purity is
due to equanimity, by realising for himself with direct knowledge,
this noble disciple here and now enters upon and abides in the
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with
the destruction of the taints.</P>
<P  >25.
“At this point, householder, the cutting off of affairs in the
Noble One’s Discipline has been achieved entirely and in all ways.
What do you think, householder? Do you see in yourself any cutting
off of affairs like this cutting off of affairs in the Noble One’s
Discipline when it is achieved entirely and in all ways?”</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, who am I that I should possess any cutting off of affairs
entirely and in all ways like that in the Noble One’s Discipline? I
am far indeed, venerable sir, from that cutting off of affairs in the
Noble One’s Discipline when it has been achieved entirely and in
all ways. For, venerable sir, though the wanderers of other sects are
not thoroughbreds, we imagined that they are thoroughbreds;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote572anc" HREF="#sdendnote572sym"><SUP>dlxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
though they are not thoroughbreds, we fed them the food of
thoroughbreds; though they are not thoroughbreds, we set them in the
place of thoroughbreds. But though the bhikkhus are thoroughbreds, we
imagined that they are not thoroughbreds; though they are
thoroughbreds, we fed them the food of those who are not
thoroughbreds; though they are thoroughbreds, we set them in the
place of those who are not thoroughbreds. But now, venerable sir,
[368] as the wanderers of other sects are not thoroughbreds, we shall
understand that they are not thoroughbreds; as they are not
thoroughbreds, we shall feed them the food of those who are not
thoroughbreds; as they are not thoroughbreds, we shall set them in
the place of those who are not thoroughbreds. But as the bhikkhus are
thoroughbreds, we shall understand that they are thoroughbreds; as
they are thoroughbreds, we shall feed them the food of thoroughbreds;
as they are thoroughbreds, we shall set them in the place of those
who are thoroughbreds. Venerable sir, the Blessed One has inspired in
me love for recluses, confidence in recluses, reverence for recluses.</P>
<P  >26.
“Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today
let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
for refuge for life.”</P>
