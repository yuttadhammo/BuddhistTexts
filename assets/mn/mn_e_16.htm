16. Cetokhila Sutta - The Wilderness in the Heart</H2>
<P  >[101]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, that any bhikkhu who has not abandoned five wildernesses
in the heart and not severed five shackles in the heart should come
to growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline -
that is impossible.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote217anc" HREF="#sdendnote217sym"><SUP>ccxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
“What, bhikkhus, are the five wildernesses in the heart that he has
not abandoned? Here a bhikkhu is doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and
unconfident about the Teacher, and thus his mind does not incline to
ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving. As his mind does not
incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving, that is the
first wilderness in the heart that he has not abandoned.</P>
<P  >4.
“Again, a bhikkhu is doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and
unconfident about the Dhamma<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote218anc" HREF="#sdendnote218sym"><SUP>ccxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
… As his mind does not incline to ardour … that is the second
wilderness in the heart that he has not abandoned.</P>
<P  >5.
“Again, a bhikkhu is doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and
unconfident about the Sangha … As his mind does not incline to
ardour … that is the third wilderness in the heart that he has not
abandoned.</P>
<P  >6.
“Again, a bhikkhu is doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and
unconfident about the training … As his mind does not incline to
ardour … that is the fourth wilderness in the heart that he has not
abandoned.</P>
<P  >7.
“Again, a bhikkhu is angry and displeased with his companions in
the holy life, resentful and callous towards them, and thus his mind
does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance,</P>
<P  >and
striving. As his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion,
perseverance, and striving, that is the fifth wilderness in the heart
that he has not abandoned.</P>
<P  >“These
are the five wildernesses in the heart that he has not abandoned.</P>
<P  >8.
“What, bhikkhus, are the five shackles in the heart that he has not
severed? Here a bhikkhu is not free from lust, desire, affection,
thirst, fever, and craving for sensual pleasures, and thus his mind
does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving. As
his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and
striving, that is the first shackle in the heart that he has not
severed.</P>
<P  >9.
“Again, a bhikkhu is not free from lust, desire, affection, thirst,
fever, and craving for the body<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote219anc" HREF="#sdendnote219sym"><SUP>ccxix</SUP></A></SUP>
… As his mind does not incline to ardour … that is the second
shackle in the heart that he has not severed. [102]</P>
<P  >10.
“Again, a bhikkhu is not free from lust, desire, affection, thirst,
fever, and craving for form … As his mind does not incline to
ardour … that is the third shackle in the heart that he has not
severed.</P>
<P  >11.
“Again, a bhikkhu eats as much as he likes until his belly is full
and indulges in the pleasures of sleeping, lolling, and drowsing …
As his mind does not incline to ardour … that is the fourth shackle
in the heart that he has not severed.</P>
<P  >12.
“Again, a bhikkhu lives the holy life aspiring to some order of
gods thus: ‘By this virtue or observance or asceticism or holy
life, I shall become a [great] god or some [lesser] god,’ and thus
his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and
striving. As his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion,
perseverance, and striving, this is the fifth shackle in the heart
that he has not severed.</P>
<P  >“These
are the five shackles in the heart that he has not severed.</P>
<P  >13.
“Bhikkhus, that any bhikkhu who has not abandoned these five
wildernesses in the heart and severed these five shackles in the
heart should come to growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma
and Discipline - that is impossible.</P>
<P  >14.
“Bhikkhus, that any bhikkhu who has abandoned five wildernesses in
the heart and severed five shackles in the heart should come to
growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline - that
is possible.</P>
<P  >15.
“What, bhikkhus, are the five wildernesses in the heart that he has
abandoned? Here a bhikkhu is not doubtful, uncertain, undecided, or
unconfident about the Teacher, and thus his mind inclines to ardour,
devotion, perseverance, and striving. As his mind inclines to ardour,
devotion, perseverance, and striving, the first wilderness in the
heart has been abandoned by him.</P>
<P  >16.
“Again, a bhikkhu is not doubtful, uncertain, undecided, or
unconfident about the Dhamma … As his mind inclines to ardour …
the second wilderness in the heart has been abandoned by him.</P>
<P  >17.
“Again, a bhikkhu is not doubtful, uncertain, undecided, or
unconfident about the Sangha … As his mind inclines to ardour …
the third wilderness in the heart has been abandoned by him.</P>
<P  >18.
“Again, a bhikkhu is not doubtful, uncertain, undecided, or
unconfident about the training … As his mind inclines to ardour …
the fourth wilderness in the heart has been abandoned by him.</P>
<P  >19.
“Again, a bhikkhu is not angry and displeased with his companions
in the holy life, nor resentful and callous towards them, and thus
his mind inclines to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving.
[103] As his mind inclines to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and
striving, the fifth wilderness in the heart has been abandoned by
him.</P>
<P  >“These
are the five wildernesses in the heart that he has abandoned.</P>
<P  >20.
“What, bhikkhus, are the five shackles in the heart that he has
severed? Here a bhikkhu is free from lust, desire, affection, thirst,
fever, and craving for sensual pleasures, and thus his mind inclines
to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving. As his mind inclines
to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving, the first shackle in
the heart has been severed by him.</P>
<P  >21.
“Again, a bhikkhu is free from lust, desire, affection, thirst,
fever, and craving for the body … As his mind inclines to ardour …
the second shackle in the heart has been severed by him.</P>
<P  >22.
“Again, a bhikkhu is free from lust, desire, affection, thirst,
fever, and craving for form … As his mind inclines to ardour …
the third shackle in the heart has been severed by him.</P>
<P  >23.
“Again, a bhikkhu does not eat as much as he likes until his belly
is full and does not indulge in the pleasures of sleeping, lolling,
and drowsing … As his mind inclines to ardour … the fourth
shackle in the heart has been severed by him.</P>
<P  >24.
“Again, a bhikkhu does not live the holy life aspiring to some
order of gods thus: ‘By this virtue or observance or asceticism or
holy life, I shall become a [great] god or some [lesser] god,’ and
thus his mind inclines to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and
striving. As his mind inclines to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and
striving, the fifth shackle in the heart has been severed by him.</P>
<P  >“These
are the five shackles in the heart that he has severed.</P>
<P  >25.
“Bhikkhus, that any bhikkhu who has abandoned these five
wildernesses in the heart and severed these five shackles in the
heart should come to growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma
and Discipline - that is possible.</P>
<P  >26.
“He develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in
concentration due to zeal and determined striving; he develops the
basis for spiritual power consisting in concentration due to energy
and determined striving; he develops the basis for spiritual power
consisting in concentration due to [purity of] mind and determined
striving; he develops the basis for spiritual power consisting in
concentration due to investigation and determined striving. And
enthusiasm is the fifth.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote220anc" HREF="#sdendnote220sym"><SUP>ccxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >27.
“A bhikkhu who thus possesses the fifteen factors including
enthusiasm is [104] capable of breaking out, capable of
enlightenment, capable of attaining the supreme security from
bondage.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote221anc" HREF="#sdendnote221sym"><SUP>ccxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Suppose
there were a hen with eight, ten, or twelve eggs, which she had
covered, incubated, and nurtured properly. Even though she did not
wish: ‘Oh, that my chicks might pierce their shells with the points
of their claws and beaks and hatch out safely!’ yet the chicks are
capable of piercing their shells with the points of their claws and
beaks and hatching out safely.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote222anc" HREF="#sdendnote222sym"><SUP>ccxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
So too, a bhikkhu who thus possesses the fifteen factors including
enthusiasm is capable of breaking out, capable of enlightenment,
capable of attaining the supreme security from bondage.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
