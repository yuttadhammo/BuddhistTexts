46. Mahadhammasamadana Sutta - The Greater Discourse on Ways of
Undertaking Things</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, for the most part beings have this wish, desire, and
longing: 'If only unwished for, undesired, disagreeable things
would diminish and wished for, desired, agreeable things would
increase!' Yet although beings have this wish, desire, and longing,
unwished for, undesired, disagreeable things increase for them and
wished for, desired, agreeable things diminish. Now, bhikkhus, what
do you think is the reason for that?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, [310] guided by the
Blessed One, have the Blessed One as their resort. It would be good
if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these words. Having
heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it."</P>
<P  >"Then
listen, bhikkhus, and attend closely to what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
"Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for
noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who
has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in
their Dhamma, does not know what things should be cultivated and what
things should not be cultivated, he does not know what things should
be followed and what things should not be followed. Not knowing this,
he cultivates things that should not be cultivated and does not
cultivate things that should be cultivated, he follows things that
should not be followed and does not follow things that should be
followed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote481anc" HREF="#sdendnote481sym"><SUP>cdlxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
It is because he does this that unwished for, undesired, disagreeable
things increase for him and wished for, desired, agreeable things
diminish. Why is that? That is what happens to one who does not see.</P>
<P  >4.
"The well-taught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and
is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for true
men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, knows what things
should be cultivated and what things should not be cultivated, he
knows what things should be followed and what things should not be
followed. Knowing this, he cultivates things that should be
cultivated and does not cultivate things that should not be
cultivated, he follows things that should be followed and does not
follow things that should not be followed. It is because he does this
that unwished for, undesired, disagreeable things diminish for him
and wished for, desired, agreeable things increase. Why is that? That
is what happens to one who sees.</P>
<P  >5.
"Bhikkhus, there are four ways of undertaking things. What are the
four? There is a way of undertaking things that is painful now and
ripens in the future as pain. There is [311] a way of undertaking
things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pain. There
is a way of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the
future as pleasure. There is a way of undertaking things that is
pleasant now and ripens in the future as pleasure.</P>
<H3 >(THE IGNORANT PERSON)</H3>
<P  >6.
(1) "Now, bhikkhus, one who is ignorant, not knowing this way of
undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as
pain, does not understand it as it actually is thus: 'This way of
undertaking things is painful now and ripens in the future as pain.'
Not knowing it, not understanding it as it actually is, the ignorant
one cultivates it and does not avoid it; because he does so, unwished
for, undesired, disagreeable things increase for him and wished for,
desired, agreeable things diminish. Why is that? That is what happens
to one who does not see.</P>
<P  >7.
(2) "Now, bhikkhus, one who is ignorant, not knowing this way of
undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as
pain, does not understand it as it actually is thus: 'This way of
undertaking things is pleasant now and ripens in the future as pain.'
Not knowing it, not understanding it as it actually</P>
<P  >is,
the ignorant one cultivates it and does not avoid it; because he does
so, unwished for … things increase for him and wished for …
things diminish. Why is that? That is what happens to one who does
not see.</P>
<P  >8.
(3) "Now, bhikkhus, one who is ignorant, not knowing this way of
undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as

<H3 >(THE WISE PERSON)</H3>
<P  >10.
(1) "Now, bhikkhus, one who is wise, knowing this way of
undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as
pain, understands it as it actually is thus: 'This way of

<H3 >(THE FOUR WAYS)</H3>
<P  >14.
(1) "What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
painful now and ripens in the future as pain? Here, bhikkhus, someone
in pain and grief kills living beings, and he experiences pain and
grief that have killing of living beings as condition. In pain and
grief he takes what is not given … misconducts himself in sensual
pleasures … speaks falsehood … speaks maliciously … speaks
harshly … gossips … is covetous … has a mind of ill will …
holds wrong view, and he experiences pain and grief that have wrong
view as condition. On the dissolution of the body, after death, he
reappears in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in
perdition, even in hell. This is called the way of undertaking things
that is painful now and ripens in the future as pain.</P>
<P  >15.
(2) "What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
pleasant now and ripens in the future as pain? Here, bhikkhus,
someone in pleasure and joy kills living beings, and he experiences
pleasure and joy that have killing of living beings as condition. In
pleasure and joy he takes what is not given … [314] … holds wrong
view, and he experiences pleasure and joy that have wrong view as
condition. On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears
in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition,
even in hell. This is called the way of undertaking things that is
pleasant now and ripens in the future as pain.</P>
<P  >16.
(3) "What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
painful now and ripens in the future as pleasure? Here, bhikkhus,
someone in pain and grief abstains from killing living beings, and he
experiences pain and grief that have abstention from killing living
beings as condition. In pain and grief he abstains from taking what
is not given … from misconduct in sensual pleasures … from
speaking falsehood … from speaking maliciously … from speaking
harshly … from gossiping … he is not covetous … he does not
have a mind of ill will … [315] … he holds right view, and he
experiences pain and grief that have right view as condition. On the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world. This is called the way of
undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as
pleasure.</P>
<P  >17.
(4) "What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
pleasant now and ripens in the future as pleasure? Here, bhikkhus,
someone in pleasure and joy abstains from killing living beings, and
he experiences pleasure and joy that have abstention from killing
living beings as condition. In pleasure and joy he abstains from
taking what is not given … he holds right view, and he experiences
pleasure and joy that have right view as condition. On the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world. This is called the way of
undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as
pleasure.</P>
<H3 >(THE SIMILES)</H3>
<P  >18.
(1) "Bhikkhus, suppose there were a bitter gourd mixed with poison,
and a man came who wanted to live, not to die, who wanted pleasure
and recoiled from pain, and they told him: 'Good man, this bitter
gourd is mixed with poison. Drink from it if you want; [316] as you
drink from it, its colour, smell, and taste will not agree with you,
and after drinking from it, you will come to death or deadly
suffering.' Then he drank from it without reflecting and did not
relinquish it. As he drank from it, its colour, smell, and taste did
not agree with him, and after drinking from it, he came to death or
deadly suffering. Similar to that, I say, is the way of undertaking
things that is painful now and ripens in the future as pain.</P>
<P  >19.
(2) "Suppose there were a bronze cup of beverage possessing a good
colour, smell, and taste, but it was mixed with poison, and a man
came who wanted to live, not to die, who wanted pleasure and recoiled
from pain, and they told him: 'Good man, this bronze cup of
beverage possesses a good colour, smell, and taste, but it is mixed
with poison. Drink from it if you want; as you drink from it, its
colour, smell, and taste will agree with you, but after drinking from
it, you will come to death or deadly suffering.' Then he drank from
it without reflecting and did not relinquish it. As he drank from it,
its colour, smell, and taste agreed with him, but after drinking from
it, he came to death or deadly suffering. Similar to that, I say, is
the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the
future as pain.</P>
<P  >20.
(3) "Suppose there were fermented urine mixed with various
medicines, and a man came sick with jaundice, and they told him:
'Good man, this fermented urine is mixed with various medicines.
Drink from it if you want; as you drink from it, its colour, smell,
and taste will not agree with you, but after drinking from it, you
will be well.' Then he drank from it after reflecting, and did not
relinquish it. As he drank from it, its colour, taste, and smell did
not agree with him, but after drinking from it, he became well.
Similar to that, I say, is the way of undertaking things that is
painful now and ripens in the future as pleasure.</P>
<P  >21.
(4) "Suppose there were curd, honey, ghee, and molasses mixed
together, and a man with dysentery came, and they told him: 'Good
man, [317] this is curd, honey, ghee, and molasses mixed together.
Drink from it if you want; as you drink from it, its colour, smell,
and taste will agree with you, and after drinking from it you will be
well.' Then he drank from it after reflecting, and did not
relinquish it. As he drank from it, its colour, smell, and taste
agreed with him, and after drinking from it, he became well. Similar
to that, I say, is the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now
and ripens in the future as pleasure.</P>
<P  >22.
"Just as, in autumn, in the last month of the rainy season, when
the sky is clear and cloudless, the sun rises above the earth
dispelling all darkness from space with its shining and beaming and
radiance, so too, the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now
and ripens in the future as pleasure dispels with its shining and
beaming and radiance any other doctrines whatsoever of ordinary
recluses and brahmins."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
