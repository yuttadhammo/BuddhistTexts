72. Aggivacchagotta Sutta - To Vacchagotta on Fire</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One [484] and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >3.
"How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'The
world is eternal: only this is true, anything else is wrong'?"</P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: 'The world is eternal: only this is true,
anything else is wrong.'"</P>
<P  >4.
"How then, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'The world is not
eternal: only this is true, anything else is wrong'?"</P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: 'The world is not eternal: only this is
true, anything else is wrong.'"</P>
<P  >5.
"How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'The
world is finite: only this is true, anything else is wrong'?"</P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: 'The world is finite: only this is true,
anything else is wrong.'"</P>
<P  >6.
"How then, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'The world is
infinite: only this is true, anything else is wrong'?"</P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: 'The world is infinite: only this is true,
anything else is wrong.'"</P>
<P  >7.
"How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'The
soul and the body are the same: only this is true, any thing else is
wrong'?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote718anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote718sym"><SUP>dccxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: 'The soul and the body are the same: only
this is true, anything else is wrong.'"</P>
<P  >8.
"How then, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'The soul is one
thing and the body another: only this is true, anything else is
wrong'?"</P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: 'The soul is one thing and the body
another: only this is true, anything else is wrong.'"</P>
<P  >9.
"How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'After
death a Tathagata exists: only this is true, anything else is
wrong'?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote719anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote719sym"><SUP>dccxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: 'After death a Tathagata exists: only this
is true, anything else is wrong.'"</P>
<P  >10.
"How then, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'After death a
Tathagata does not exist: only this is true, anything else is
wrong'?"</P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: 'After death a Tathagata does not exist:
only this is true, anything else is wrong.'"</P>
<P  >11.
"How is it, Master Gotama, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'After
death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist: only this is true,
anything else is wrong.'?' [485]</P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: 'After death a Tathagata both exists and
does not exist: only this is true, anything else is wrong.'"</P>
<P  >12.
"How then, does Master Gotama hold the view: 'After death a
Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist: only this is true,
anything else is wrong'?"</P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
I do not hold the view: 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor
does not exist: only this is true, anything else is wrong.'"</P>
<P  >13.
"How is it then, Master Gotama? When Master Gotama is asked each of
these ten questions, he replies: 'I do not hold that view.' What
danger does Master Gotama see that he does not take up any of these
speculative views?"</P>
<P  >14.
"Vaccha, the speculative view that the world is eternal is a
thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a
vacillation of views, a fetter of views. It is beset by suffering, by
vexation, by despair, and by fever, and it does not lead to
disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct
knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana.</P>
<P  >"The
speculative view that the world is not eternal ... that the world is
finite ... that the world is infinite ... that the soul and the body
are the same ... that the soul is one thing and the body another ...
that after death a Tathagata exists [486] ... that after death a
Tathagata does not exist ... that after death a Tathagata both exists
and does not exist ... that after death a Tathagata neither exists
nor does not exist is a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a
contortion of views, a vacillation of views, a fetter of views. It is
beset by suffering, by vexation, by despair, and by fever, and it
does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to
peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. Seeing this
danger, I do not take up any of these speculative views."</P>
<P  >15.
"Then does Master Gotama hold any speculative view at all?"</P>
<P  >"Vaccha,
'speculative view' is something that the Tathagata has put away.
For the Tathagata, Vaccha, has seen<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote720anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote720sym"><SUP>dccxx</SUP></A></SUP>
this: 'Such is material form, such its origin, such its
disappearance; such is feeling, such its origin, such its
disappearance; such is perception, such its origin, such its
disappearance; such are formations, such their origin, such their
disappearance; such is consciousness, such its origin, such its
disappearance.' Therefore, I say, with the destruction, fading
away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of all conceivings, all
excogitations, all I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency
to conceit, the Tathagata is liberated through not clinging."</P>
<P  >16.
"When a bhikkhu's mind is liberated thus, Master Gotama, where
does he reappear [after death]?"</P>
<P  >"The
term 'reappears' does not apply, Vaccha."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote721anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote721sym"><SUP>dccxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Then
he does not reappear, Master Gotama?"</P>
<P  >"The
term 'does not reappear' does not apply, Vaccha."</P>
<P  >"Then
he both reappears and does not reappear, Master Gotama?"</P>
<P  >"The
term 'both reappears and does not reappear' does not apply,
Vaccha."</P>
<P  >"Then
he neither reappears nor does not reappear, Master Gotama?"</P>
<P  >"The
term 'neither reappears nor does not reappear' does not apply,
Vaccha."</P>
<P  >17.
"When Master Gotama is asked these four questions, he replies: 'The
term "reappears" does not apply, Vaccha; the term "does not
reappear" does not apply, Vaccha; the term "both reappears and
does not reappear" does not apply, Vaccha; the term "neither
reappears nor [487] does not reappear" does not apply, Vaccha.'
Here I have fallen into bewilderment, Master Gotama, here I have
fallen into confusion, and the measure of confidence I had gained
through previous conversation with Master Gotama has now
disappeared."</P>
<P  >18.
"It is enough to cause you bewilderment, Vaccha, enough to cause
you confusion. For this Dhamma, Vaccha, is profound, hard to see and
hard to understand, peaceful and sublime, unattainable by mere
reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by the wise. It is hard for you
to understand it when you hold another view, accept another teaching,
approve of another teaching, pursue a different training, and follow
a different teacher. So I shall question you about this in return,
Vaccha. Answer as you choose.</P>
<P  >19.
"What do you think, Vaccha? Suppose a fire were burning before you.
Would you know: 'This fire is burning before me'?"</P>
<P  >"I
would, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"If
someone were to ask you, Vaccha: 'What does this fire burning
before you burn in dependence on?' - being asked thus, what would
you answer?"</P>
<P  >"Being
asked thus, Master Gotama, I would answer: 'This fire burning
before me burns in dependence on grass and sticks.'"</P>
<P  >"If
that fire before you were to be extinguished, would you know: 'This
fire before me has been extinguished'?"</P>
<P  >"I
would, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"If
someone were to ask you, Vaccha: 'When that fire before you was
extinguished, to which direction did it go: to the east, the west,
the north, or the south?' - being asked thus, what would you
answer?"</P>
<P  >"That
does not apply, Master Gotama. The fire burned in dependence on its
fuel of grass and sticks. When that is used up, if it does not get
any more fuel, being without fuel, it is reckoned as extinguished."</P>
<P  >20.
"So too, Vaccha, the Tathagata has abandoned that material form by
which one describing the Tathagata might describe him;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote722anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote722sym"><SUP>dccxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, done away
with it so that it is no longer subject to future arising. The
Tathagata is liberated from reckoning in terms of material form,
Vaccha, he is profound, immeasurable, unfathomable like the ocean.
The term 'reappears' does not apply, the term 'does not
reappear' does not apply, [488] the term 'both reappears and does
not reappear' does not apply, the term 'neither reappears nor
does not reappear' does not apply.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote723anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote723sym"><SUP>dccxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
The Tathagata has abandoned that feeling by which one describing the
Tathagata might describe him ... has abandoned that perception by
which</P>
<P  >one
describing the Tathagata might describe him ... has abandoned those
formations by which one describing the Tathagata might describe him ...
has abandoned that consciousness by which one describing the
Tathagata might describe him; he has cut it off at the root, made it
like a palm stump, done away with it so that it is no longer subject
to future arising. The Tathagata is liberated from reckoning in terms
of consciousness, Vaccha; he is profound, immeasurable, unfathomable
like the ocean. The term 'reappears' does not apply, the term
'does not reappear' does not apply, the term 'both reappears
and does not reappear' does not apply, the term 'neither appears
nor does not appear' does not apply."</P>
<P  >21.
When this was said, the wanderer Vacchagotta said to the Blessed One:
"Master Gotama, suppose there were a great sala tree not far from a
village or town, and impermanence wore away its branches and foliage,
its bark and sapwood, so that on a later occasion, being divested of
branches and foliage, divested of bark and sapwood, it became pure,
consisting entirely of heartwood; so too, this discourse of Master
Gotama's is divested of branches and foliage, divested of bark and
sapwood, and is pure, consisting entirely of heartwood.</P>
<P  >22.
"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master
Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were
turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden,
showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark
[489] for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for
refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today
let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
for refuge for life."</P>
