8. Sallekha Sutta - Effacement</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote101anc" HREF="#sdendnote101sym"><SUP>ci</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthii in Jeta’s
Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Maha Cunda rose from
meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the
Blessed One he sat down at one side and said to him:</P>
<P  >3.
“Venerable sir, various views arise in the world associated either
with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote102anc" HREF="#sdendnote102sym"><SUP>cii</SUP></A></SUP>
Now does the abandoning and relinquishing of those views come about
in a bhikkhu who is attending only to the beginning [of his
meditative training]?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote103anc" HREF="#sdendnote103sym"><SUP>ciii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Cunda,
as to those various views that arise in the world associated either
with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world: if [the
object] in relation to which those views arise, which they underlie,
and which they are exercised upon<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote104anc" HREF="#sdendnote104sym"><SUP>civ</SUP></A></SUP>
is seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not
mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ then the abandoning and
relinquishing of those views comes about.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote105anc" HREF="#sdendnote105sym"><SUP>cv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(THE EIGHT ATTAINMENTS)</H3>
<P  >4.
“It is possible here, Cunda, that quite secluded from sensual
pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, some bhikkhu enters upon
and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He
might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But it is not
these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One’s
Discipline: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ [41
] in the Noble One’s Discipline.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote106anc" HREF="#sdendnote106sym"><SUP>cvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
“It is possible here that with the stilling of applied and
sustained thought, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second
jhana, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without
applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of
concentration. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’
But … these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the
Noble One’s Discipline.</P>
<P  >6.
“It is possible here that with the fading away as well of rapture,
some bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still
feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the
third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a
pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’ He might think
thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But … these are called
‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</P>
<P  >7.
“It is possible here that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain,
and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, some bhikkhu
enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’
But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in
the Noble One’s Discipline: these are called ‘pleasant abidings
here and now’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</P>
<P  >8.
“It is possible here that with the complete surmounting of
perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory
impact, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that
‘space is infinite,’ some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the
base of infinite space. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in
effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called
‘effacement’ in the Noble One’s Discipline: these are called
‘peaceful abidings’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</P>
<P  >9.
“It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of
infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite,’ some
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness.
He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But … these
are called ‘peaceful abidings’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</P>
<P  >10.
“It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of
infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ some
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness. He might
think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But … these are
called ‘peaceful abidings’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</P>
<P  >11.
“It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of
nothingness, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He might think thus: ‘I am
abiding in effacement.’ [42] But these attainments are not called
‘effacement’ in the Noble One’s Discipline: these are called
‘peaceful abidings’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</P>

<H3 >(INCLINATION OF MIND)</H3>
<P  >13.
“Cunda, I say that even the inclination of mind towards wholesome
states is of great benefit, so what should be said of bodily and
verbal acts conforming [to such a state of mind]?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote110anc" HREF="#sdendnote110sym"><SUP>cx</SUP></A></SUP>

difficulty; we shall not adhere to our own views or hold on to them
tenaciously, but shall relinquish them easily.’</P>
<H3 >(AVOIDANCE)</H3>

“Cunda, that one who is himself sinking in the mud should pull out
another who is sinking in the mud is impossible; that one who is not
himself sinking in the mud should pull out another who is sinking in
the mud is possible. That one who is himself untamed, undisciplined,
[with defilements] unextinguished, should tame another, discipline
him, and help extinguish [his defilements] is impossible; that one
who is himself tamed, disciplined, [with defilements] extinguished,
should tame another, discipline him, and help extinguish [his
defilements] is possible.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote111anc" HREF="#sdendnote111sym"><SUP>cxi</SUP></A></SUP>

<H3 >(CONCLUSION)</H3>
<P  >17.
“So, Cunda, the way of effacement has been taught by me, the way of
inclining the mind has been taught by me, the way of avoidance has
been taught by me, the way leading upwards has been taught by me, and
the way of extinguishing has been taught by me.</P>
<P  >18.
“What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a
teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I
have done for you, Cunda.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote113anc" HREF="#sdendnote113sym"><SUP>cxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
There are these roots of trees, these empty huts. Meditate, Cunda, do
not delay or else you will regret it later. This is our instruction
to you.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Maha Cunda was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
