49. Brahmanimantanika Sutta - The Invitation of a Brahma</H2>
<P  >[326]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatth-1 in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, on one occasion I was living at Ukkattha in the Subhaga
Grove at the root of a royal sala tree.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote499anc" HREF="#sdendnote499sym"><SUP>cdxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
Now on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in Baka the Brahma
thus: 'This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal,
this is total, this is not subject to pass away; for this neither is
born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor reappears, and beyond this
there is no escape.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote500anc" HREF="#sdendnote500sym"><SUP>d</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
"1 knew with my mind the thought in the mind of Baka the Brahma, so
just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex
his extended arm, I vanished from the root of the royal sala tree in
the Subhaga Grove at Ukkattha and appeared in that Brahma-world. Baka
the Brahma saw me coming in the distance and said: 'Come, good sir!
Welcome, good sir! It is long, good sir, since you found an
opportunity to come here. Now, good sir, this is permanent, this is
everlasting, this is eternal, this is total, this is not subject to
pass away; for this neither is born nor ages nor dies nor passes away
nor reappears, and beyond this there is no escape.'</P>
<P  >4.
"When this was said, I told Baka the Brahma: 'The worthy Baka the
Brahma has lapsed into ignorance; he has lapsed into ignorance in
that he says of the impermanent that it is permanent, of the
transient that it is everlasting, of the non-eternal that it is
eternal, of the incomplete that it is total, of what is subject to
pass away that it is not subject to pass away, of what is born, ages,
dies, passes away, and reappears, that it neither is born nor ages
nor dies nor passes away nor reappears; and when there is an escape
beyond this, he says that there is no escape beyond this.'</P>
<P  >5.
"Then Mara the Evil One took possession of a member of the Brahma's
Assembly,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote501anc" HREF="#sdendnote501sym"><SUP>di</SUP></A></SUP>
and he told me: 'Bhikkhu, bhikkhu, do not disbelieve him, do not
disbelieve him; for this Brahma is the Great Brahma, [327] the
Overlord, the Untranscended, of Infallible Vision, Wielder of
Mastery, Lord Maker and Creator, Most High Providence, Master and
Father of those that are and ever can be. Before your time, bhikkhu,
there were recluses and brahmins in the world who condemned earth
through disgust with earth,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote502anc" HREF="#sdendnote502sym"><SUP>dii</SUP></A></SUP>
who condemned water through disgust with water, who condemned fire
through disgust with fire, who condemned air through disgust with
air, who condemned beings through disgust with beings, who condemned
gods through disgust with gods, who condemned Pajapati through
disgust with Pajapati, who condemned Brahma through disgust with
Brahma; and on the dissolution of the body, when their life was cut
off, they became established in an inferior body.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote503anc" HREF="#sdendnote503sym"><SUP>diii</SUP></A></SUP>
Before your time, bhikkhu, there were also recluses and brahmins in
the world who lauded earth through delight in earth'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote504anc" HREF="#sdendnote504sym"><SUP>div</SUP></A></SUP>
who lauded water through delight in water, who lauded fire through
delight in fire, who lauded air through delight in air, who lauded
beings through delight in beings, who lauded gods through delight in
gods, who lauded Pajapati through delight in Pajapati, who lauded
Brahma through delight in Brahma; and on the dissolution of the body,
when their life was cut off, they became established in a superior
body.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote505anc" HREF="#sdendnote505sym"><SUP>dv</SUP></A></SUP>
So, bhikkhu, I tell you this: Be sure, good sir, to do only as the
Brahma says; never overstep the word of the Brahma. If you overstep
the word of the Brahma, bhikkhu, then, like a man trying to deflect
an approaching beam of light with a stick, or like a man losing his
hold on the earth with his hands and feet as he slips into a deep
chasm, so it will befall you, bhikkhu. Be sure, good sir, to do only
as the Brahma says; never overstep the word of the Brahma. Do you not
see the Brahma's Assembly seated here, bhikkhu?' And Mara the
Evil One thus called to witness the Brahma's Assembly.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote506anc" HREF="#sdendnote506sym"><SUP>dvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
"When this was said, I told Mara the Evil One: 'I know you, Evil
One. Do not think: "He does not know me." You are Mara, Evil One,
and the Brahma and the Brahma's Assembly and the members of the
Brahma's Assembly have all fallen into your hands, they have all
fallen into your power. You, Evil One, think: "This one too has
fallen into my hands, he too has fallen into my power"; but I have
not fallen into your hands, Evil One, I have not fallen into your
power.'</P>
<P  >7.
"When this was said, Baka the Brahma told me: 'Good sir, I say of
the permanent that it is permanent, [328] of the everlasting that it
is everlasting, of the eternal that it is eternal, of the total that
it is total, of what is not subject to pass away that it is not
subject to pass away, of what neither is born nor ages nor dies nor
passes away nor reappears that it neither is born nor ages nor dies
nor passes away nor reappears; and when there is no escape beyond
this, I say that there is no escape beyond this. Before your time,
bhikkhu, there were recluses and brahmins in the world whose
asceticism lasted as long as your whole life. They knew, when there
is an escape beyond, that there is an escape beyond, and when there
is no escape beyond, that there is no escape beyond. So, bhikkhu, I
tell you this: You will find no escape beyond, and eventually you
will reap only weariness and disappointment. If you will hold to
earth, you will be close to me, within my domain, for me to work my
will upon and punish.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote507anc" HREF="#sdendnote507sym"><SUP>dvii</SUP></A></SUP>
If you hold to water … to fire … to air … to beings … to gods
… to Pajapati … to Brahma, you will be close to me, within my
domain, for me to work my will upon and punish.'</P>
<P  >8.
"'I know that too, Brahma. If I will hold to earth, I shall be
close to you, within your domain, for you to work your will upon and
punish. If I will hold to water … to fire … to air … to beings
… to gods … to Pajapati … to Brahma, I shall be close to you,
within your domain, for you to work your will upon and punish.
Further, I understand your reach and your sway to extend thus: Baka
the Brahma has this much power, this much might, this much
influence.'</P>
<P  >"'Now,
good sir, how far do you understand my reach and my sway to extend?'</P>
<P  >9.
"'As far as moon and sun revolve</P>
<P >
Shining and lighting up the quarters,</P>
<P >
Over a thousandfold such world</P>
<P >
Does your sovereignty extend.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
And there you know the high and low,</P>
<P >
And those with lust and free from lust,</P>
<P >
The state that is thus and otherwise,</P>
<P >
The coming and going of beings.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >Brahma,
I understand your reach and your sway to extend thus: Baka the Brahma
has this much power, this much might, [329] this much influence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote508anc" HREF="#sdendnote508sym"><SUP>dviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >10.
"'But, Brahma, there are three other bodies, which you neither
know nor see, and which I know and see. There is the body called [the
gods of] Streaming Radiance, from which you passed away and
reappeared here.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote509anc" HREF="#sdendnote509sym"><SUP>dix</SUP></A></SUP>
Because you have dwelt here long, your memory of that has lapsed, and
hence you do not know or see it, but I know and see it. Thus, Brahma,
in regard to direct knowledge I do not stand merely at the same level
as you, how then could I know less? Rather, I know more than you.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote510anc" HREF="#sdendnote510sym"><SUP>dx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"'There
is the body called [the gods of] Refulgent Glory … There is the
body called [the gods of] Great Fruit. You do not know or see that,
but I know and see it. Thus, Brahma, in regard to direct knowledge I
do not stand merely at the same level as you, how then could I know
less? Rather, I know more than you.</P>
<P  >11.
"'Brahma, having directly known earth as earth, and having
directly known that which is not commensurate with the earthness of
earth, I did not claim to be earth, I did not claim to be in earth, I
did not claim to be apart from earth, I did not claim earth to be
"mine," I did not affirm earth.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote511anc" HREF="#sdendnote511sym"><SUP>dxi</SUP></A></SUP>
Thus, Brahma, in regard to direct knowledge I do not stand merely at
the same level as you, how then could I know less? Rather, I know
more than you.</P>
<P  >12-23.
"'Brahma, having directly known water as water … fire as fire …
air as air … beings as beings … gods as gods … Pajapati as
Pajapati … Brahma as Brahma … the gods of Streaming Radiance as
the gods of Streaming Radiance … the gods of Refulgent Glory as the
gods of Refulgent Glory … the gods of Great Fruit as the gods of
Great Fruit … the Overlord as the Overlord … all as all, and
having directly known that which is not commensurate with the allness
of all, I did not claim to be all, I did not claim to be in all, I
did not claim to be apart from all, I did not claim all to be "mine,"
I did not affirm all. Thus, Brahma, in regard to direct knowledge, I
do not stand merely at the same level as you, how then could I know
less? Rather, I know more than you.'</P>
<P  >24.
"'Good sir, [if you claim to directly know] that which is not
commensurate with the allness of all, may your claim not turn out to
be vain and empty!'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote512anc" HREF="#sdendnote512sym"><SUP>dxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >25.
"'The consciousness that makes no showing,</P>
<P >
Nor has to do with finiteness,</P>
<P >
Not claiming being with respect to all:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote513anc" HREF="#sdendnote513sym"><SUP>dxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >that
is not commensurate with the earthness of earth, that is not
commensurate with the waterness of water … [330] … that is not
commensurate with the allness of all.'</P>
<P  >26.
"'Good sir, I shall vanish from you.'</P>
<P  >"'Vanish
from me if you can, Brahma.'</P>
<P  >"Then
Baka the Brahma, saying: 'I shall vanish from the recluse Gotama, I
shall vanish from the recluse Gotama,' was unable to vanish.
Thereupon I said: 'Brahma, I shall vanish from you.'</P>
<P  >"'Vanish
from me if you can, good sir.'</P>
<P  >"Then
I performed such a feat of supernormal power that the Brahma and the
Brahma's Assembly and the members of the Brahma's Assembly could
hear my voice but could not see me. After I had vanished, I uttered
this stanza:</P>
<P  >27.
"'Having seen fear in every mode of being</P>
<P >
And in being seeking for non-being,</P>
<P >
I did not affirm any mode of being,</P>
<P >
Nor did I cling to any delight [in being].'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote514anc" HREF="#sdendnote514sym"><SUP>dxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >28.
"At that the Brahma and the Brahma's Assembly and the members of
the Brahma's Assembly were struck with wonder and amazement,
saying: 'It is wonderful, sirs, it is marvellous, the great power
and great might of the recluse Gotama! We have never before seen or
heard of any other recluse or brahmin who had such great power and
such great might as has this recluse Gotama, who went forth from a
Sakyan clan. Sirs, though living in a generation that delights in
being, that takes delight in being, that rejoices in being, he has
extirpated being together with its root.'</P>
<P  >29.
"Then Mara the Evil One took possession of a member of the Brahma's
Assembly, and he said to me: 'Good sir, if that is what you know,
if that is what you have discovered, do not guide your [lay]
disciples or those gone forth, do not teach the Dhamma to your [lay]
disciples or to those gone forth, create no yearning in your [lay]
disciples or in those gone forth. Before your time, bhikkhu, there
were recluses and brahmins in the world claiming to be accomplished
and fully enlightened, and they guided their [lay] disciples and
those gone forth; they taught the Dhamma to their [lay] disciples and
to those gone forth; they created yearning in their [lay] disciples
and in those gone forth; and on the dissolution of the body, when
their life was cut off, they became established in an inferior body.
Before your time, bhikkhu, there were also recluses and brahmins in
the world claiming to be accomplished and fully enlightened,</P>
<P  >[331]
and they did not guide their [lay] disciples or those gone forth;
they did not teach the Dhamma to their [lay] disciples or to those
gone forth; they created no yearning in their [lay] disciples or in
those gone forth; and on the dissolution of the body, when their life
was cut off, they became established in a superior body. So, bhikkhu,
I tell you this: Be sure, good sir, to abide inactive, devoted to a
pleasant abiding here and now; this is better left undeclared, and
so, good sir, inform no one else.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote515anc" HREF="#sdendnote515sym"><SUP>dxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >30.
"When this was said, I told Mara the Evil One: 'I know you, Evil
One. Do not think: "He does not know me." You are Mara, Evil One.
It is not out of compassion for their welfare that you speak thus, it
is without compassion for their welfare that you speak thus. You
think thus, Evil One: "Those to whom the recluse Gotama teaches the
Dhamma will escape from my sphere." Those recluses and brahmins of
yours, Evil One, who claimed to be accomplished and fully
enlightened, were not accomplished and fully enlightened. But I, who
claim to be accomplished and fully enlightened, am accomplished and
fully enlightened. If the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma to disciples
he is such, Evil One, and if the Tathagata does not teach the Dhamma
to disciples he is such.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote516anc" HREF="#sdendnote516sym"><SUP>dxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
If the Tathagata guides disciples he is such, Evil One, and if the
Tathagata does not guide disciples he is such. Why is that? Because
the Tathagata has abandoned the taints that defile, bring renewal of
being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth,
ageing, and death; he has cut them off at the root, made them like a
palm stump, done away with them so that they are no longer subject to
future arising. Just as a palm tree whose crown is cut off is
incapable of further growth, so too, the Tathagata has abandoned the
taints that defile … cut them off at the root, made them like a
palm stump, done away with them so that they are no longer subject to
future arising.'"</P>
<P  >31.
Thus, because Mara was unable to reply, and because [it began] with
the Brahma's invitation, this discourse is entitled "On the
Invitation of a Brahma."</P>
