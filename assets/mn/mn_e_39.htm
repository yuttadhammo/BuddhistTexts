39. Maha-Assapura Sutta - The Greater Discourse at Assapura</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Angan country at a town of the Angans named Assapura. There the
Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable
sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"'Recluses, recluses,' bhikkhus, that is how people perceive
you. And when you are asked, 'What are you?', you claim that you
are recluses. Since that is what you are designated and what you
claim to be, you should train thus: 'We will undertake and practise
those things that make one a recluse, that make one a brahmin,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote415anc" HREF="#sdendnote415sym"><SUP>cdxv</SUP></A></SUP>
so that our designations may be true and our claims genuine, and so
that the services of those whose robes, almsfood, resting place, and
medicinal requisites we use shall bring them great fruit and benefit,
and so that our going forth shall not be in vain but fruitful and
fertile.'</P>
<H3 >(CONDUCT AND LIVELIHOOD)</H3>
<P  >3.
"And what, bhikkhus, are the things that make one a recluse, that
make one a brahmin? Bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'We will be
possessed of shame and fear of wrongdoing.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote416anc" HREF="#sdendnote416sym"><SUP>cdxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Now, bhikkhus, you may think thus: 'We are possessed of shame and
fear of wrongdoing. That much is enough, that much has been done, the
goal of recluseship has been reached, there is nothing more for us to
do'; and you may rest content with that much. Bhikkhus, I inform
you, I declare to you: You who seek the recluse's status, do not
fall short of the goal of recluseship while there is more to be
done.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote417anc" HREF="#sdendnote417sym"><SUP>cdxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
"What more is to be done? [272] Bhikkhus, you should train thus:
'Our bodily conduct shall be purified, clear and open, flawless and
restrained, and we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on
account of that purified bodily conduct.' Now, bhikkhus, you may
think thus: 'We are possessed of shame and fear of wrongdoing and
our bodily conduct has been purified.</P>
<P  >That
much is enough, that much has been done, the goal of recluseship has
been reached, there is nothing more for us to do'; and you may rest
content with that much. Bhikkhus, I inform you, I declare to you: You
who seek the recluse's status, do not fall short of the goal of
recluseship while there is more to be done.</P>
<P  >5.
"What more is to be done? Bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'Our
verbal conduct shall be purified, clear and open, flawless and
restrained, and we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on
account of that purified verbal conduct.'</P>
<P  >Now,
bhikkhus, you may think thus: 'We are possessed of shame and fear
of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct has been purified, and our verbal
conduct has been purified. That much is enough … '; and you may
rest content with that much. Bhikkhus, I inform you, I declare to
you: You who seek the recluse's status, do not fall short of the
goal of recluseship while there is more to be done.</P>
<P  >6.
"What more is to be done? Bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'Our
mental conduct shall be purified, clear and open, flawless and
restrained, and we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on
account of that purified mental conduct.' Now, bhikkhus, you may
think thus: 'We are possessed of shame and fear of wrongdoing, our
bodily conduct and verbal conduct have been purified, and our mental
conduct has been purified. That much is enough … '; and you may
rest content with that much. Bhikkhus, I inform you, I declare to
you: You who seek the recluse's status, do not fall short of the
goal of recluseship while there is more to be done.</P>
<P  >7.
"What more is to be done? Bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'Our
livelihood shall be purified, clear and open, flawless and
restrained, and we will not laud ourselves and disparage others on
account of that purified livelihood.' Now, bhikkhus, you may think
thus: 'We are possessed of shame and fear of wrongdoing, our bodily
conduct, verbal conduct, and mental conduct have been purified, and
our livelihood has been purified. [273] That much is enough … ';
and you may rest content with that much.</P>
<P  >Bhikkhus,
I inform you, I declare to you: You who seek the recluse's status,
do not fall short of the goal of recluseship while there is more to
be done.</P>
<H3 >(RESTRAINT OF THE SENSES)</H3>
<P  >8.
"What more is to be done? Bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'We
will guard the doors of our sense faculties. On seeing a form with
the eye, we will not grasp at its signs and features. Since, if we
left the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of
covetousness and grief might invade us, we will practise the way of
its restraint, we will guard the eye faculty, we will undertake the
restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear … On
smelling an odour with the nose … On tasting a flavour with the
tongue … On touching a tangible with the body … On cognizing a
mind-object with the mind, we will not grasp at its signs and
features. Since, if we left the mind faculty unguarded, evil
unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might invade us, we will
practise the way of its restraint, we will guard the mind faculty, we
will undertake the restraint of the mind faculty.' Now, bhikkhus,
you may think thus: 'We are possessed of shame and fear of
wrongdoing, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, and
livelihood have been purified, and we guard the doors of our sense
faculties. That much is enough … '; and you may rest content with
that much. Bhikkhus, I inform you, I declare to you: You who seek the
recluse's status, do not fall short of the goal of recluseship
while there is more to be done.</P>
<H3 >(MODERATION IN EATING)</H3>
<P  >9.
"What more is to be done? Bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'We
will be moderate in eating. Reflecting wisely, we will take food
neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for the sake of
physical beauty and attractiveness, but only for the endurance and
continuance of this body, for ending discomfort, and for assisting
the holy life, considering: "Thus I shall terminate old feelings
without arousing new feelings and I shall be healthy and blameless
and shall live in comfort.'"Now, bhikkhus, you may think thus:
'We are possessed of shame and fear of wrongdoing, our bodily
conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct, and livelihood have been
purified, we guard the doors of our sense faculties, and we are
moderate in eating. That much is enough … '; and you may rest
content with that much. Bhikkhus, I inform you, I declare to you: You
who seek the recluse's status, do not fall short of the goal of
recluseship while there is more to be done.</P>
<H3 >(WAKEFULNESS)</H3>
<P  >10.
"What more is to be done? Bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'We
will be devoted to wakefulness. During the day, while walking back
and forth and sitting, we will purify our minds of obstructive
states. In the first watch of the night, [274] while walking back and
forth and sitting, we will purify our minds of obstructive states. In
the middle watch of the night we will lie down on the right side in
the lion's pose with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and
fully aware, after noting in our minds the time for rising. After
rising, in the third watch of the night, while walking back and forth
and sitting, we will purify our minds of obstructive states.' Now,
bhikkhus, you may think thus: 'We are possessed of shame and fear
of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental conduct,
and livelihood have been purified, we guard the doors of our sense
faculties, we are moderate in eating, and we are devoted to
wakefulness. That much is enough … '; and you may rest content
with that much. Bhikkhus, I inform you, I declare to you: You who
seek the recluse's status, do not fall short of the goal of
recluseship while there is more to be done.</P>
<H3 >(MINDFULNESS AND FULL AWARENESS)</H3>
<P  >11.
"What more is to be done? Bhikkhus, you should train thus: 'We
will be possessed of mindfulness and full awareness. We will act in
full awareness when going forward and returning; we will act in full
awareness when looking ahead and looking away; we will act in full
awareness when flexing and extending our limbs; we will act in full
awareness when wearing our robes and carrying our outer robe and
bowl; we will act in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming
food, and tasting; we will act in full awareness when defecating and
urinating; we will act in full awareness when walking, standing,
sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.'
Now, bhikkhus, you may think thus: 'We are possessed of shame and
fear of wrongdoing, our bodily conduct, verbal conduct, mental
conduct, and livelihood have been purified, we guard the doors of our
sense faculties, we are moderate in eating, we are devoted to
wakefulness, and we are possessed of mindfulness and full awareness.
That much is enough, that much has been done, the goal of recluseship
has been reached, there is nothing more for us to do'; and you may
rest content with that much. Bhikkhus, I inform you, I declare to
you: You who seek the recluse's status, do not fall short of the
goal of recluseship while there is more to be done.</P>
<H3 >(ABANDONING OF THE HINDRANCES)</H3>
<P  >12.
"What more is to be done? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu resorts to a
secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a
ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open
space, a heap of straw.</P>
<P  >13.
"On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down,
folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect and establishing
mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he
abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from
covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind
free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living
beings; [275] he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred.
Abandoning sloth and torpor, he abides free from sloth and torpor,
percipient of light, mindful and fully aware; he purifies his mind
from sloth and torpor. Abandoning restlessness and remorse, he abides
unagitated with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from
restlessness and remorse. Abandoning doubt, he abides having gone
beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his
mind from doubt.</P>
<P  >14.
"Bhikkhus, suppose a man were to take a loan and undertake business
and his business were to succeed so that he could repay all the money
of the old loan and there would remain enough extra to maintain a
wife; then on considering this, he would be glad and full of joy. Or
suppose a man were afflicted, suffering and gravely ill, and his food
would not agree with him and his body had no strength, but later he
would recover from the affliction and his food would agree with him
and his body would regain strength; then on considering this, he
would be glad and full of joy. Or suppose a man were imprisoned in a
prisonhouse, but later he would be released from prison, safe and
secure, with no loss to his property; then on considering this, he
would be glad and full of joy. Or suppose a man were a slave, not
self-dependent but dependent on others, unable to go where he wants,
but later on he would be released from slavery, self-dependent,
independent of others, a freed man able to go where he wants; then on
considering this, [276] he would be glad and full of joy. Or suppose
a man with wealth and property were to enter a road across a desert,
but later on he would cross over the desert, safe and secure, with no
loss to his property; then on considering this, he would be glad and
full of joy. So too, bhikkhus, when these five hindrances are
unabandoned in himself, a bhikkhu sees them respectively as a debt, a
disease, a prisonhouse, slavery, and a road across a desert. But when
these five hindrances have been abandoned in himself, he sees that as
freedom from debt, healthiness, release from prison, freedom from
slavery, and a land of safety.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote418anc" HREF="#sdendnote418sym"><SUP>cdxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(THE FOUR JHANAS)</H3>
<P  >15.
"Having abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the mind
that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the first
jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He makes the rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and pervade this
body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. Just as a skilled bath man or
a bath man's apprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basin and,
sprinkling it gradually with water, kneads it until the moisture wets
his ball of bath powder, soaks it, and pervades it inside and out,
yet the ball itself does not ooze; so too, a bhikkhu makes the
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion drench, steep, fill, and
pervade this body, so that there is no part of his whole body
unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</P>
<P  >16.
"Again, bhikkhus, with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which
has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.
He makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration drench,
steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part of his
whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of
concentration. Just as though there were a lake whose waters welled
up from below [277] and it had no inflow from east, west, north, or
south, and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of
rain, then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make
the cool water drench, steep, fill, and pervade the lake, so that
there would be no part of the whole lake unpervaded by cool water; so
too, a bhikkhu makes the rapture and pleasure born of concentration
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure born of
concentration.</P>
<P  >17.
"Again, bhikkhus, with the fading away as well of rapture, a
bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still
feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the
third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a
pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.' He makes the
pleasure divested of rapture drench, steep, fill, and pervade this
body, so that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the
pleasure divested of rapture. Just as, in a pond of blue or red or
white lotuses, some lotuses that are born and grow in the water
thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it, and cool water
drenches, steeps, fills, and pervades them to their tips and their
roots, so that there is no part of all those lotuses unpervaded by
cool water; so too, a bhikkhu makes the pleasure divested of rapture
drench, steep, fill, and pervade this body, so that there is no part
of his whole body unpervaded by the pleasure divested of rapture.</P>
<P  >18.
"Again, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and
with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity. He sits pervading this body with a pure bright mind, so
that there is no part of his whole body unpervaded by the pure bright
mind. Just as though a man were sitting covered from the head down
with a white cloth, so that there would be no part of his whole [278]
body unpervaded by the white cloth; so too, a bhikkhu sits pervading
this body with a pure bright mind, so that there is no part of his
whole body unpervaded by the pure bright mind.</P>
<H3 >(THE THREE TRUE KNOWLEDGES)</H3>
<P  >19.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one
birth, two births … (as Sutta 4, §27) … Thus with their aspects
and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. Just as a man
might go from his own village to another village and then back again
to his own village, he might think: 'I went from my own village to
that village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way,
spoke in such a way, kept silent in such a way; and from that village
I went to that other village, and there I stood in such a way, sat in
such a way, spoke in such a way, kept silent in such a way; and from
that village I came back again to my own village.' So too, a
bhikkhu recollects his manifold past lives … Thus with their
aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives.</P>
<P  >20.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings … (as Sutta 4, §29) [279] … Thus with the
divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings
passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly,
fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on
according to their actions. Just as though there were two houses with
doors and a man with good sight standing there between them saw
people entering the houses and coming out and passing to and fro, so
too, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human,
a bhikkhu sees beings passing away and reappearing … and he
understands how beings pass on according to their actions.</P>
<P  >21.
"When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to
imperturbability, he directs it to knowledge of the destruction of
the taints. He understands as it actually is: 'This is suffering';
… 'This is the origin of suffering'; … 'This is the
cessation of suffering'; … 'This is the way leading to the
cessation of suffering'; … 'These are the taints'; … 'This
is the origin of the taints'; … 'This is the cessation of the
taints'; … 'This is the way leading to the cessation of the
taints.'</P>
<P  >"When
he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of
sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: 'It is
liberated.' He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being.'</P>
<P  >"Just
as if there were a lake in a mountain recess, clear, limpid, and
undisturbed, so that a man with good sight standing on the bank could
see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming
about and resting, he might think: 'There is this lake, clear,
limpid, and undisturbed, and there are these [280] shells, gravel,
and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about and
resting.' So too, a bhikkhu understands as it actually is: 'This
is suffering.' … He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the holy
life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no
more coming to any state of being.'</P>
<H3 >(THE ARAHANT)</H3>
<P  >22.
"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu such as this is called a recluse, a brahmin,
one who has been washed, one who has attained to knowledge, a holy
scholar, a noble one, an arahant.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote419anc" HREF="#sdendnote419sym"><SUP>cdxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
"And how is a bhikkhu a recluse? He has quieted down evil
unwholesome states that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble,
ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death. That
is how a bhikkhu is a recluse.</P>
<P  >24.
"And how is a bhikkhu a brahmin? He has expelled evil unwholesome
states that defile … and lead to future birth, ageing, and death.
That is how a bhikkhu is a brahmin.</P>
<P  >25.
"And how is a bhikkhu one who has been washed?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote420anc" HREF="#sdendnote420sym"><SUP>cdxx</SUP></A></SUP>
He has washed off evil unwholesome states that defile … and lead to
future birth, ageing, and death. That is how a bhikkhu is one who has
been washed.</P>
<P  >26.
"And how is a bhikkhu one who has attained to knowledge? He has
known evil unwholesome states that defile … and lead to future
birth, ageing, and death. That is how a bhikkhu is one who has
attained to knowledge.</P>
<P  >27.
"And how is a bhikkhu a holy scholar?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote421anc" HREF="#sdendnote421sym"><SUP>cdxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
The evil unwholesome states that defile … and lead to future birth,
ageing, and death, have streamed away from him. That is how a bhikkhu
is a holy scholar.</P>
<P  >28.
"And how is a bhikkhu a noble one? Evil unwholesome states that
defile … and lead to future birth, ageing, and death, are far away
from him. That is how a bhikkhu is a noble one.</P>
<P  >29.
"And how is a bhikkhu an arahant? Evil unwholesome states that
defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and
lead to future birth, ageing, and death, are far away from him. That
is how a bhikkhu is an arahant."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
