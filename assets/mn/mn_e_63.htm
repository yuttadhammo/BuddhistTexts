63. Culamalunkya Sutta - The Shorter Discourse to<BR>Malunkyaputta</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, while the venerable Malunkyaputta was alone in meditation, the
following thought arose in his mind:</P>
<P  >“These
speculative views have been undeclared by the Blessed One, set aside
and rejected by him, namely: ‘the world is eternal’ and ‘the
world is not eternal’; ‘the world is finite’ and ‘the world
is infinite’; ‘the soul is the same as the body’ and ‘the
soul is one thing and the body another’; and ‘after death a
Tathagata exists’ and ‘after death a Tathagata does not exist’
and ‘after death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist’ and
‘after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist.’ The
Blessed One does not declare these to me, and I do not approve of and
accept the fact that he does not declare these to me, so I shall go
to the Blessed One and ask him the meaning of this. If he declares to
me either ‘the world is eternal’ or ‘the world is not eternal’
… or ‘after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist,’
then I will lead the holy life under him; if he does not declare
these to me, then I will abandon the training and return to the low
life.” [427]</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Malunkyaputta rose from
meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him,
he sat down at one side and told him:</P>
<P  >“Here,
venerable sir, while I was alone in meditation, the following thought
arose in my mind: ‘These speculative views have been undeclared by
the Blessed One … If he does not declare these to me, then I will
abandon the training and return to the low life.’ If the Blessed
One knows ‘the world is eternal,’ let the Blessed One declare to
me ‘the world is eternal’; if the</P>
<P  >Blessed
One knows ‘the world is not eternal,’ let the Blessed One declare
to me ‘the world is not eternal.’ If the Blessed One does not
know either ‘the world is eternal’ or ‘the world is not
eternal,’ then it is straightforward for one who does not know and
does not see to say: ‘I do not know, I do not see.’</P>
<P  >“If
the Blessed One knows ‘the world is finite,’ … ’the world is
infinite,’ … ’the soul is the same as the body,’ … ’the
soul is one thing and the body another,’ … ’after death a
Tathagata exists,’ [428] … ’after death a Tathagata does not
exist,’.. .If the Blessed One knows ‘after death a Tathagata both
exists and does not exist,’ let the Blessed One declare that to me;
if the Blessed One knows ‘after death a Tathagata neither exists
nor does not exist,’ let the Blessed One declare that to me. If the
Blessed One does not know either ‘after death a Tathagata both
exists and does not exist’ or ‘after death a Tathagata neither
exists nor does not exist,’ then it is straightforward for one who
does not know and does not see to say: ‘I do not know, I do not
see.’“</P>
<P  >4.
“How then, Malunkyaputta, did I ever say to you: ‘Come,
Malunkyaputta, lead the holy life under me and I will declare to you
“the world is eternal” … or “after death a Tathagata neither
exists nor does not exist’”?” - “No, venerable sir.” - “Did
you ever tell me: ‘I will lead the holy life under the Blessed One,
and the Blessed One will declare to me “the world is eternal” …
or “after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist’”?”
- “No, venerable sir.” - “That being so, misguided man, who are
you and what are you abandoning?</P>
<P  >5.
“If anyone should say thus: ‘I will not lead the holy life under
the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me “the world is
eternal” … or “after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does
not exist,’“[429] that would still remain undeclared by the
Tathagata and meanwhile that person would die. Suppose,
Malunkyaputta, a man were wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with
poison, and his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives,
brought a surgeon to treat him. The man would say: ‘I will not let
the surgeon pull out this arrow until I know whether the man who
wounded me was a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a worker.’ And
he would say: ‘I will not let the surgeon pull out this arrow until
I know the name and clan of the man who wounded me; … until I know
whether the man who wounded me was tall or short or of middle height;
… until I know whether the man who wounded me was dark or brown or
golden-skinned; … until I know whether the man who wounded me lives
in such a village or town or city; … until I know whether the bow
that wounded me was a long bow or a crossbow; … until I know
whether the bowstring that wounded me was fibre or reed or sinew or
hemp or bark; … until I know whether the shaft that wounded me was
wild or cultivated; … until I know with what kind of feathers the
shaft that wounded me was fitted - whether those of a vulture or a
crow or a hawk or a peacock or a stork; … until I know with what
kind of sinew the shaft that wounded me was bound - whether that of
an ox or a buffalo or a lion or a monkey; … until I know what kind
of arrow it was that wounded me - whether it was hoof-tipped or
curved or barbed or calf-toothed or oleander.’ [430]</P>
<P  >“All
this would still not be known to that man and meanwhile he would die.
So too, Malunkyaputta, if anyone should say thus: ‘I will not lead
the holy life under the Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to
me: “the world is eternal” … or “after death a Tathagata
neither exists nor does not exist,’“that would still remain
undeclared by the Tathagata and meanwhile that person would die.</P>
<P  >6.
“Malunkyaputta, if there is the view ‘the world is eternal,’
the holy life cannot be lived; and if there is the view ‘the world
is not eternal,’ the holy life cannot be lived. Whether there is
the view ‘the world is eternal’ or the view ‘the world is not
eternal,’ there is birth, there is ageing, there is death, there
are sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair, the destruction of
which I prescribe here and now.</P>
<P  >“If
there is the view ‘the world is finite,’ … ‘the world is
infinite,’ … ’the soul is the same as the body,’ … ’the
soul is one thing and the body another,’ … ‘after death a
Tathagata exists,’ … ’after death a Tathagata does not exist,’
the holy life cannot be lived … [431] If there is the view ‘after
death a Tathagata both exists and does not exist,’ the holy life
cannot be lived; and if there is the view ‘after death a Tathagata
neither exists nor does not exist,’ the holy life cannot be lived.
Whether there is the view ‘after death a Tathagata both exists and
does not exist’ or the view ‘after death a Tathagata neither
exists nor does not exist,’ there is birth, there is ageing, there
is death, there are sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair,
the destruction of which I prescribe here and now.</P>
<P  >7.
“Therefore, Malunkyaputta, remember what I have left undeclared as
undeclared, and remember what I have declared as declared. And what
have I left undeclared? ‘The world is eternal’ - I have left
undeclared. ‘The world is not eternal’ - I have left undeclared.
‘The world is finite’ - I have left undeclared. ‘The world is
infinite’ - I have left undeclared. ‘The soul is the same as the
body’ - I have left undeclared. ‘The soul is one thing and the
body another’ - I have left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathagata
exists’ - I have left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathagata does
not exist’ - I have left undeclared. ‘After death a Tathagata
both exists and does not exist’ - I have left undeclared. ‘After
death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist’ - I have left
undeclared.</P>
<P  >8.
“Why have I left that undeclared? Because it is unbeneficial, it
does not belong to the fundamentals of the holy life, it does not
lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to
direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. That is why I have
left it undeclared.</P>
<P  >9.
“And what have I declared? ‘This is suffering’ - I have
declared. ‘This is the origin of suffering’ - I have declared.
‘This is the cessation of suffering’ - I have declared. ‘This
is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’ - I have
declared.</P>
<P  >10.
“Why have I declared that? Because it is beneficial, it belongs to
the fundamentals of the holy life, it leads to disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana. That is why I have declared it.</P>
<P  >“Therefore,
Malunkyaputta, [432] remember what I have left undeclared as
undeclared, and remember what I have declared as declared.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Malunkyaputta was
satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote648anc" HREF="#sdendnote648sym"><SUP>dcxlviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
