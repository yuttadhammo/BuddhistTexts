42. Veranjaka Sutta - The Brahmins of Veranja</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion some brahmin householders of Veranja were on a
visit to Savatthi for some business or other. [291]</P>
<P  >3-44.
[The text of this sutta is the same as that of Sutta 41, except that
where the preceding sutta is phrased in terms of "conduct not in
accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct" (§§7-10) and
"conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct"
(§§11-14), this sutta is phrased in terms of "one who does not
observe conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, one of unrighteous
conduct" and "one who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, one of righteous conduct"; substitute "Veranja" for
"Sala" throughout.]</P>
