124. Bakkula Sutta - Bakkula</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the venerable Bakkula was living
at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1167anc" HREF="#sdendnote1167sym"><SUP>mclxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >2.
Then Acela Kassapa, a former companion of the venerable Bakkula in
his lay life, [125] went to the venerable Bakkula and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and asked the venerable Bakkula:</P>
<P  >3.
"Friend Bakkula, how long is it since you went forth?"</P>
<P  >"It
is eighty years since I went forth, friend."</P>
<P  >"Friend
Bakkula, in these eighty years how many times have you engaged in
sexual intercourse?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Kassapa, you should not ask me such a question as that. You should
ask me such a question as this: 'Friend Bakkula, in these eighty
years how many times have perceptions of sensual desire arisen in
you?'"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Bakkula, in these eighty years how many times have perceptions of
sensual desire arisen in you?"</P>
<P  >"Friend
Kassapa, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any
perception of sensual desire to have ever arisen in me."</P>
<P  >[That
in the eighty years since he went forth the venerable Bakkula did not
recall any perception of sensual desire to have ever arisen in him -
this we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula. ]<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1168anc" HREF="#sdendnote1168sym"><SUP>mclxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4-5.
"Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any
perception of ill will … any perception of cruelty to have ever
arisen in me."</P>
<P  >[That
in the eighty years since he went forth the venerable Bakkula did not
recall any perception of ill will … any perception of cruelty to
have ever arisen in him - this we remember as a wonderful and
marvellous quality of the venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >6.
"Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any
thought of sensual desire to have ever arisen in me."</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >7-8.
"Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall any
thought of ill will … any thought of cruelty to have ever arisen in
me."</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.] [126]</P>
<P  >9-15.
"Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall
ever having accepted a robe from a householder<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1169anc" HREF="#sdendnote1169sym"><SUP>mclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
… ever having worn a robe given by a householder … ever having
cut a robe with a cutter … ever having sewn a robe with a needle …
ever having coloured a robe with dye … ever having sewn a robe at
the kathina time … ever having worked on making robes for my
companions in the holy life."</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >16-19.
"Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall
ever having accepted an invitation to a meal … ever having given
rise to the thought: 'Oh, may someone invite me to a meal!' …
ever having sat down inside a house … ever having eaten inside a
house."</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >20-25.
"Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall
ever having grasped at the signs and features of a woman … ever
having taught the Dhamma to a woman, even as much as a four-line
stanza … ever having gone to the bhikkhunis' quarters … ever
having taught the Dhamma to a bhikkhuni … ever having taught the
Dhamma to a female probationer … ever having taught the Dhamma to a
female novice."</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >26-29.
"Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall
ever having given the going forth … ever having given the full
admission … ever having given dependence … ever having had a
novice wait on me."</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >30-37.
"Friend, in the eighty years since I went forth I do not recall
ever having bathed in a bath house. ..ever having bathed with bath
powder … ever having undertaking the work of massaging the limbs of
my companions in the holy life [127] … ever having had an
affliction arise in me even for as long as it takes to milk a cow …
ever having taken medicine, even as much as a piece of gallnut …
ever having used a bolster … ever having made up a bed … ever
having entered upon residence for the Rains in a resting place inside
a village."</P>
<P  >[ …
this too we remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the
venerable Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >38.
"Friend, for seven days after going forth I ate the country's
almsfood as a debtor; on the eighth day final knowledge</P>
<P  >arose."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1170anc" HREF="#sdendnote1170sym"><SUP>mclxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >[That
for seven days the venerable Bakkula ate the country's almsfood as
a debtor, and on the eighth day final knowledge arose - this too we
remember as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the venerable
Bakkula.]</P>
<P  >39.
[Then Acela Kassapa said:] "I would receive the going forth in this
Dhamma and Discipline, I would receive the full admission." And
Acela Kassapa received the going forth in this Dhamma and Discipline,
he received the full admission.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1171anc" HREF="#sdendnote1171sym"><SUP>mclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
And soon, not long after his full admission, dwelling alone,
withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Kassapa, by
realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered
upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of
which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness.
He knew directly: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being." And the venerable Kassapa became one of the
arahants.</P>
<P  >40.
Then, on a later occasion, the venerable Bakkula took a key and went
from cell to cell, saying: "Come forth, venerable sirs; come forth,
venerable sirs. Today I shall attain final Nibbana."</P>
<P  >[That
the venerable Bakkula took a key and went from cell to cell saying:
"Come forth, venerable sirs; come forth, venerable sirs. Today I
shall attain final Nibbana" - this too we remember as a wonderful
and marvellous quality of the venerable Bakkula.] [128]</P>
<P  >41.
Then, seated in the midst of the Sangha of bhikkhus, the venerable
Bakkula attained final Nibbana.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1172anc" HREF="#sdendnote1172sym"><SUP>mclxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
