141. Saccavibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of the Truths</H2>
<P  >[248]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There he addressed the
bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,” they replied.
The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“At Benares, bhikkhus, in the Deer Park at Isipatana the Tathagata,
accomplished and fully enlightened, set rolling the matchless Wheel
of the Dhamma,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1288anc" HREF="#sdendnote1288sym"><SUP>mcclxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
which cannot be stopped by any recluse or brahmin or god or Mara or
Brahma or anyone in the world - that is, the announcing, teaching,
describing, establishing, revealing, expounding, and exhibiting of
the Four Noble Truths. Of what four?</P>
<P  >3.
“The announcing, teaching, describing, establishing, revealing,
expounding, and exhibiting of the noble truth of suffering. The
announcing, teaching, describing, establishing, revealing,
expounding, and exhibiting of the noble truth of the origin of
suffering … of the noble truth of the cessation of suffering … of
the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</P>
<P  >4.
“At Benares, bhikkhus, in the Deer Park at Isipatana the Tathagata,
accomplished and fully enlightened, set rolling the matchless Wheel
of the Dhamma, which cannot be stopped by any recluse or brahmin or
god or Mara or Brahma or anyone in the world - that is, the
announcing, teaching, describing, establishing, revealing,
expounding, and exhibiting of these Four Noble Truths.</P>
<P  >5.
“Cultivate the friendship of Sariputta and Moggallana, bhikkhus;
associate with Sariputta and Moggallana. They are wise and helpful to
their companions in the holy life. Sariputta is like a mother;
Moggallana is like a nurse. Sariputta trains others for the fruit of
stream-entry, Moggallana for the supreme goal.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1289anc" HREF="#sdendnote1289sym"><SUP>mcclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Sariputta, bhikkhus, is able to announce, teach, describe, establish,
reveal, expound, and exhibit the Four Noble Truths.”</P>
<P  >6.
So the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One rose from
his seat and went into his dwelling. [249]</P>
<P  >7.
Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the venerable Sariputta
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Friends, bhikkhus.” - “Friend,”
the bhikkhus replied to the venerable Sariputta. The venerable
Sariputta said this:</P>
<P  >8.
“At Benares, friends, in the Deer Park at Isipatana the Tathagata,
accomplished and fully enlightened, set rolling the matchless Wheel
of the Dhamma … and exhibiting of the Four Noble Truths. Of what
four?</P>
<P  >9.
“The announcing … and exhibiting of the noble truth of suffering
… of the noble truth of the origin of suffering … of the noble
truth of the cessation of suffering … of the noble truth of the way
leading to the cessation of suffering.</P>
<P  >10.
“And what, friends, is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is
suffering; ageing is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are suffering; not to obtain
what one wants is suffering; in short, the five aggregates affected
by clinging are suffering.</P>
<P  >11.
“And what, friends, is birth?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1290anc" HREF="#sdendnote1290sym"><SUP>mccxc</SUP></A></SUP>
The birth of beings into the various orders of beings, their coming
to birth, precipitation [in a womb], generation, the manifestation of
the aggregates, obtaining the bases for contact - this is called
birth.</P>
<P  >12.
“And what, friends, is ageing? The ageing of beings in the various
orders of beings, their old age, brokenness of teeth, greyness of
hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of life, weakness of faculties -
this is called ageing.</P>
<P  >13.
“And what, friends, is death? The passing of beings out of the
various orders of beings, their passing away, dissolution,
disappearance, dying, completion of time, dissolution of aggregates,
laying down of the body - this is called death.</P>
<P  >14.
“And what, friends, is sorrow? The sorrow, sorrowing,
sorrowfulness, inner sorrow, inner sorriness, of one who has
encountered some misfortune or is affected by some painful state -
this is called sorrow.</P>
<P  >15.
“And what, friends, is lamentation? The wail and lament, wailing
and lamenting, [250] bewailing and lamentation, of one who has
encountered some misfortune or is affected by some painful state -
this is called lamentation.</P>
<P  >16.
“And what, friends, is pain? Bodily pain, bodily discomfort,
painful, uncomfortable feeling born of bodily contact - this is
called pain.</P>
<P  >17.
“And what, friends, is grief? Mental pain, mental discomfort,
painful, uncomfortable feeling born of mental contact - this is
called grief.</P>
<P  >18.
“And what, friends, is despair? The trouble and despair, the
tribulation and desperation, of one who has encountered some
misfortune or is affected by some painful state - this is called
despair.</P>
<P  >19.
“And what, friends, is ‘not to obtain what one wants is
suffering’? To beings subject to birth there comes the wish: ‘Oh,
that we were not subject to birth! That birth would not come to us!’
But this is not to be obtained by wishing, and not to obtain what one
wants is suffering. To beings subject to ageing. . .subject to
sickness … subject to death … subject to sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair, there comes the wish: ‘Oh, that we were
not subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair! That
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair would not come to us!’
But this is not to be obtained by wishing, and not to obtain what one
wants is suffering.</P>
<P  >20.
“And what, friends, are the five aggregates affected by clinging
that, in short, are suffering? They are: the material form aggregate
affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the
perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate
affected by clinging, and the consciousness aggregate affected by
clinging. These are the five aggregates affected by clinging that, in
short, are suffering. This is called the noble truth of suffering.</P>
<P  >21.
“And what, friends, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering?
It is craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by
delight and lust, and delights in this and that; that is, craving for
sensual pleasures, craving for being, [251] and craving for
non-being. This is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering.</P>
<P  >22.
“And what, friends, is the noble truth of the cessation of
suffering? It is the remainderless fading away and ceasing, the
giving up, relinquishing, letting go, and rejecting of that same
craving. This is called the noble truth of the cessation of
suffering.</P>
<P  >23.
“And what, friends, is the noble truth of the way leading to the
cessation of suffering? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that
is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.</P>
<P  >24.
“And what, friends, is right view? Knowledge of suffering,
knowledge of the origin of suffering, knowledge of the cessation of
suffering, and knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering - this is called right view.</P>
<P  >25.
“And what, friends, is right intention? Intention of renunciation,
intention of non-ill will, and intention of non-cruelty - this is
called right intention.</P>
<P  >26.
“And what, friends, is right speech? Abstaining from false speech,
abstaining from malicious speech, abstaining from harsh speech, and
abstaining from idle chatter - this is called right speech.</P>
<P  >27.
“And what, friends, is right action? Abstaining from killing living
beings, abstaining from taking what is not given, and abstaining from
misconduct in sensual pleasures - this is called right action.</P>
<P  >28.
“And what, friends, is right livelihood? Here a noble disciple,
having abandoned wrong livelihood, earns his living by right
livelihood - this is called right livelihood.</P>
<P  >29.
“And what, friends, is right effort? Here a bhikkhu awakens zeal
for the non-arising of unarisen evil unwholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. He awakens zeal
for the abandoning of arisen evil unwholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. He awakens zeal
for the arising of unarisen wholesome states, [252] and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. He awakens zeal
for the continuance, non-disappearance, strengthening, increase, and
fulfilment by development of arisen wholesome states, and he makes
effort, arouses energy, exerts his mind, and strives. This is called
right effort.</P>
<P  >30.
“And what, friends, is right mindfulness? Here a bhikkhu abides
contemplating the body as a body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful,
having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides
contemplating feelings as feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful,
having put away covetousness and</P>
<P  >grief
for the world. He abides contemplating mind as mind, ardent, fully
aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the
world. He abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent,
fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for
the world. This is called right mindfulness.</P>
<P  >31.
“And what, friends, is right concentration? Here, quite secluded
from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu
enters upon and abides in the first jhana, which is accompanied by
applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion. With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he
enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has self-confidence
and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of concentration. With the fading away as
well of rapture, he abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully
aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and
abides in the third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce:
‘He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’
With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous
disappearance of joy and grief, he enters upon and abides in the
fourth jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of
mindfulness due to equanimity. This is called right concentration.</P>
<P  >“This
is called the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.</P>
<P  >32.
“At Benares, friends, in the Deer Park at Isipatana the Tathagata,
accomplished and fully enlightened, set rolling the matchless Wheel
of the Dhamma, which cannot be stopped by any recluse or brahmin or
god or Mara or Brahma or anyone in the world - that is, the
announcing, teaching, describing, establishing, revealing,
expounding, and exhibiting of these Four Noble Truths.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the venerable Sariputta said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the venerable Sariputta’s words.</P>
