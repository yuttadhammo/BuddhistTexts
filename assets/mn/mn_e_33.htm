33. Mahagopalaka Sutta - The Greater Discourse on the Cowherd</H2>
<P  >[220]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, when a cowherd possesses eleven factors, he is incapable
of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle. What eleven? Here a cowherd
has no knowledge of form, he is unskilled in characteristics, he
fails to pick out flies' eggs, he fails to dress wounds, he fails
to smoke out the sheds, he does not know the watering place, he does
not know what it is to have drunk, he does not know the road, he is
unskilled in pastures, he milks dry, and he shows no extra veneration
to those bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. When a
cowherd possesses these eleven factors, he is incapable of keeping
and rearing a herd of cattle.</P>
<P  >3.
"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses eleven qualities, he is
incapable of growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and
Discipline. What eleven? Here a bhikkhu has no knowledge of form, he
is unskilled in characteristics, he fails to pick out flies' eggs,
he fails to dress wounds, he fails to smoke out the sheds, he does
not know the watering place, he does not know what it is to have
drunk, he does not know the road, he is unskilled in pastures, he
milks dry, and he shows no extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus
of long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of
the Sangha.</P>
<P  >4.
"How has a bhikkhu no knowledge of form? Here a bhikkhu does not
understand as it actually is thus: 'All material form of whatever
kind consists of the four great elements and the material form
derived from the four great elements.' That is how a bhikkhu has no
knowledge of form.</P>
<P  >5.
"How is a bhikkhu unskilled in characteristics? Here a bhikkhu does
not understand as it actually is thus: 'A fool is characterised by
his actions; a wise man is characterised by his actions.' That is
how a bhikkhu is unskilled in characteristics.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote364anc" HREF="#sdendnote364sym"><SUP>ccclxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
"How does a bhikkhu fail to pick out flies' eggs? Here, when a
thought of sensual desire has arisen, a bhikkhu tolerates it; he does
not abandon it, remove it, do away with it, and annihilate it. When a
thought of ill will has arisen … When a thought of cruelty has
arisen … When evil unwholesome states have arisen, a bhikkhu
tolerates them; [221] he does not abandon them, remove them, do away
with them, and annihilate them. That is how a bhikkhu fails to pick
out flies' eggs.</P>
<P  >7.
"How does a bhikkhu fail to dress wounds? Here, on seeing a form
with the eye, a bhikkhu grasps at its signs and features. Even
though, when he leaves the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome
states of covetousness and grief might invade him, he does not
practise the way of its restraint, he does not guard the eye faculty,
he does not undertake the restraint of the eye faculty. On hearing a
sound with the ear … On smelling an odour with the nose … On
tasting a flavour with the tongue … On touching a tangible with the
body … On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, he grasps at its
signs and features. Even though, when he leaves the mind faculty
unguarded, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and grief might
invade him, he does not practise the way of its restraint, he does
not guard the mind faculty, he does not undertake the restraint of
the mind faculty. That is how a bhikkhu fails to dress wounds.</P>
<P  >8.
"How does a bhikkhu fail to smoke out the sheds? Here a bhikkhu
does not teach others in detail the Dhamma as he has learned it and
mastered it. That is how a bhikkhu fails to smoke out the sheds.</P>
<P  >9.
"How does a bhikkhu not know the watering place? Here a bhikkhu
does not go from time to time to those bhikkhus who have learned
much, who are well versed in the tradition, who maintain the Dhamma,
the Discipline, and the Codes,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote365anc" HREF="#sdendnote365sym"><SUP>ccclxv</SUP></A></SUP>
and he does not enquire and ask questions of them thus: 'How is
this, venerable sir? What is the meaning of this?' These venerable
ones do not reveal to him what has not been revealed, do not clarify
what is not clear, or remove his doubts about the numerous things
that give rise to doubt. That is how a bhikkhu does not know the
watering place.</P>
<P  >10.
"How does a bhikkhu not know what it is to have drunk? Here, when
the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata is being
taught, a bhikkhu does not gain inspiration in the meaning, does not
gain inspiration in the Dhamma, does not gain gladness connected with
the Dhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote366anc" HREF="#sdendnote366sym"><SUP>ccclxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how a bhikkhu does not know what it is to have drunk.</P>
<P  >11.
"How does a bhikkhu not know the road? Here a bhikkhu does not
understand the Noble Eightfold Path as it actually is. That is how a
bhikkhu does not know the road.</P>
<P  >12.
"How is a bhikkhu unskilled in pastures? Here a bhikkhu does not
understand the four foundations of mindfulness as they actually are.
That is how [222] a bhikkhu is unskilled in pastures.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote367anc" HREF="#sdendnote367sym"><SUP>ccclxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
"How does a bhikkhu milk dry? Here, when faithful householders
invite a bhikkhu to take as much as he likes of robes, almsfood,
resting places, and medicinal requisites, the bhikkhu does not know
moderation in accepting. That is how a bhikkhu milks dry.</P>
<P  >14.
"How does a bhikkhu show no extra veneration to those elder
bhikkhus of long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and
leaders of the Sangha? Here a bhikkhu does not maintain bodily acts
of loving-kindness both openly and privately towards those elder
bhikkhus; he does not maintain verbal acts of loving-kindness towards
them both openly and privately; he does not maintain mental acts of
loving-kindness towards them both openly and privately. That is how a
bhikkhu shows no extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus of
long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of
the Sangha.</P>
<P  >"When
a bhikkhu possesses these eleven qualities, he is incapable of
growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline.</P>
<P  >15.
"Bhikkhus, when a cowherd possesses eleven factors, he is capable
of keeping and rearing a herd of cattle. What eleven? Here a cowherd
has knowledge of form, he is skilled in characteristics, he picks out
flies' eggs, he dresses wounds, he smokes out the sheds, he knows
the watering place, he knows what it is to have drunk, he knows the
road, he is skilled in pastures, he does not milk dry, and he shows
extra veneration to those bulls who are fathers and leaders of the
herd. When a cowherd possesses these eleven factors, he is capable of
keeping and rearing a herd of cattle.</P>
<P  >16.
"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses these eleven qualities,
he is capable of growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamrna and
Discipline. What eleven? Here a bhikkhu has knowledge of form, he is
skilled in characteristics, he picks out flies' eggs, he dresses
wounds, he smokes out the sheds, he knows the watering place, he
knows what it is to have drunk, he knows the road, he is skilled in
pastures, he does not milk dry, and he shows extra veneration to
those elder bhikkhus of longstanding who have long since gone forth,
the fathers and leaders of the Sangha.</P>
<P  >17.
"How does a bhikkhu have knowledge of form? Here a bhikkhu
understands as it actually is thus: 'All material form of whatever
kind consists of the four [223] great elements and the material form
derived from the four great elements.' That is how a bhikkhu has
knowledge of form.</P>
<P  >18.
"How is a bhikkhu skilled in characteristics? Here a bhikkhu
understands as it actually is thus: 'A fool is characterised by his
actions; a wise man is characterised by his actions.' That is how a
bhikkhu is skilled in characteristics.</P>
<P  >19.
"How does a bhikkhu pick out flies' eggs? Here, when a thought of
sensual desire has arisen, a bhikkhu does not tolerate it; he
abandons it, removes it, does away with it, and annihilates it. When
a thought of ill will has arisen … When a thought of cruelty has
arisen … When evil unwholesome states have arisen, a bhikkhu does
not tolerate them; he abandons them, removes them, does away with
them, and annihilates them. That is how a bhikkhu picks out flies'
eggs.</P>
<P  >20.
"How does a bhikkhu dress wounds? Here, on seeing a form with the
eye, a bhikkhu does not grasp at its signs and features. Since if he
left the eye faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of
covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its
restraint, he guards the eye faculty, he undertakes the restraint of
the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear … On smelling an
odour with the nose … On tasting a flavour with the tongue … On
touching a tangible with the body … On cognizing a mind-object with
the mind, a bhikkhu does not grasp at its signs and features. Since,
if he left the mind faculty unguarded, evil unwholesome states of
covetousness and grief might invade him, he practises the way of its
restraint, he guards the mind faculty, he undertakes the restraint of
the mind faculty. That is how a bhikkhu dresses wounds.</P>
<P  >21.
"How does a bhikkhu smoke out the sheds? Here a bhikkhu teaches
others in detail the Dhamma as he has learned it and mastered it.
That is how a bhikkhu smokes out the sheds.</P>
<P  >22.
"How does a bhikkhu know the watering place? Here a bhikkhu goes
from time to time to such bhikkhus who have learned much, who are
well versed in the tradition, who maintain the Dhamma, the
Discipline, and the Codes, and he enquires and asks questions of them
thus: 'How is this, venerable sir? What is the meaning of this?'
These venerable ones reveal to him what has not been revealed,
clarify what is not clear, and remove his doubts about the numerous
things that give rise to doubt. That is how a bhikkhu knows the
watering place.</P>
<P  >23.
"How does [224] a bhikkhu know what it is to have drunk? Here, when
the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata is being
taught, a bhikkhu gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration
in the Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the Dhamma. That is how
a bhikkhu knows what it is to have drunk.</P>
<P  >24.
"How does a bhikkhu know the road? Here a bhikkhu understands the
Noble Eightfold Path as it actually is. That is how a bhikkhu
understands the road.</P>
<P  >25.
"How is a bhikkhu skilled in pastures? Here a bhikkhu understands
the four foundations of mindfulness as they actually are. That is how
a bhikkhu is skilled in pastures.</P>
<P  >26.
"How does a bhikkhu not milk dry? Here, when faithful householders
invite a bhikkhu to take as much as he likes of robes, almsfood,
resting places, and medicinal requisites, the bhikkhu knows
moderation in accepting. That is how a bhikkhu does not milk dry.</P>
<P  >27.
"How does a bhikkhu show extra veneration to those elder bhikkhus
of long-standing who have long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of
the Sangha? Here a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of loving-kindness
both openly and privately towards those elder bhikkhus; he maintains
verbal acts of loving-kindness towards them both openly and
privately; he maintains mental acts of loving-kindness towards them
both openly and privately. That is how a bhikkhu shows extra
veneration to those elder bhikkhus of long-standing who have long
gone forth, the fathers and leaders of the Sangha.</P>
<P  >"When
a bhikkhu possesses these eleven qualities, he is capable of growth,
increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
