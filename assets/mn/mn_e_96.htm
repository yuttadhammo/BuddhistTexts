96. Esukari Sutta - To Esukari</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the brahmin Esukari went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said:</P>
<P  >3.
"Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four levels of service. They
prescribe the level of service towards a brahmin, the level of
service towards a noble, the level of service towards a merchant, and
the level of service towards a worker. Therein, Master Gotama, the
brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a brahmin: a
brahmin may serve a brahmin, a noble may serve a brahmin, a merchant
may serve a brahmin, and a worker may serve a brahmin. That is the
level of service towards a brahmin [178] that the brahmins prescribe.
Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe this as the level of service
towards a noble: a noble may serve a noble, a merchant may serve a
noble, and a worker may serve a noble. That is the level of service
towards a noble that the brahmins prescribe. Master Gotama, the
brahmins prescribe this as the level of service towards a merchant: a
merchant may serve a merchant and a worker may serve a merchant. That
is the level of service towards a merchant that the brahmins
prescribe. Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe this as the level of
service towards a worker: only a worker may serve a worker; for who
else could serve a worker? That is the level of service towards a
worker that the brahmins prescribe. What does Master Gotama say about
this?"</P>
<P  >4.
"Well, brahmin, has all the world authorised the brahmins to
prescribe these four levels of service?" - "No, Master Gotama."
- "Suppose, brahmin, they were to force a cut of meat upon a poor,
penniless, destitute man and tell him: 'Good man, you must eat this
meat and pay for it'; so too, without the consent of those [other]
recluses and brahmins, the brahmins nevertheless prescribe those four
levels of service.</P>
<P  >5.
"I do not say, brahmin, that all are to be served, nor do I say
that none are to be served. For if, when serving someone, one becomes
worse and not better because of that service, then I say that he
should not be served. And if, when serving someone, one becomes
better and not worse because of that service, then I say that he
should be served.</P>
<P  >6.
"If they were to ask a noble thus: 'Which of these should you
serve - one in whose service you become worse and not better when
serving him, or one in whose service you become better and not worse
when serving him: [179] answering rightly, a noble would answer thus:
'I should not serve the one in whose service I become worse and not
better when serving him; I should serve the one in whose service I
become better and not worse when serving him.'</P>
<P  >"If
they were to ask a brahmin … to ask a merchant … to ask a worker
… answering rightly, a worker would answer thus: 'I should not
serve the one in whose service I become worse and not better when
serving him; I should serve the one in whose service I become better
and not worse when serving him.'</P>
<P  >7.
"I do not say, brahmin, that one is better because one is from an
aristocratic family, nor do I say that one is worse because one is
from an aristocratic family. I do not say that one is better because
one is of great beauty, nor do I say that one is worse because one is
of great beauty. I do not say that one is better because one is of
great wealth, nor do I say that one is worse because one is of great
wealth.</P>
<P  >8.
"For here, brahmin, one from an aristocratic family may kill living
beings, take what is not given, misconduct himself in sensual
pleasures, speak falsely, speak maliciously, speak harshly, gossip,
be covetous, have a mind of ill will, and hold wrong view. Therefore
I do not say that one is better because one is from an aristocratic
family. But also, brahmin, one from an aristocratic family may
abstain from killing living beings, from taking what is not given,
from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from false speech, from
malicious speech, from harsh speech, and from gossip, and he may be
uncovetous, have a mind without ill will, and hold right view.
Therefore I do not say that one is worse because one is from an
aristocratic family.</P>
<P  >"Here,
brahmin, one of great beauty … one of great wealth may kill living
beings … and hold wrong view. Therefore I do not say that one is
better because one is of great beauty … of great wealth. But also,
brahmin, one of great beauty … of great wealth may abstain from
killing living beings … and hold right view. Therefore [180] I do
not say that one is worse because one is of great beauty … of great
wealth.</P>
<P  >9.
"1 do not say, brahmin, that all are to be served, nor do I say
that none are to be served. For if, when serving someone, one's
faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom increase in his
service, then I say that he should be served."</P>
<P  >10.
When this was said, the brahmin Esukari said to the Blessed One:
"Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four types of wealth. They
prescribe the wealth of a brahmin, the wealth of a noble, the wealth
of a merchant, and the wealth of a worker.</P>
<P  >"Therein,
Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a brahmin
- wandering for alms;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote894anc" HREF="#sdendnote894sym"><SUP>dcccxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
a brahmin who spurns his own wealth, wandering for alms, abuses his
duty like a guard who takes what has not been given. That is the
wealth of a brahmin which the brahmins prescribe. Master Gotama, the
brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a noble - the bow and
quiver; a noble who spurns his own wealth, the bow and quiver, abuses
his duty like a guard who takes what has not been given. That is the
wealth of a noble which the brahmins prescribe. Master Gotama, the
brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a merchant - farming and
cattle-breeding;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote895anc" HREF="#sdendnote895sym"><SUP>dcccxcv</SUP></A></SUP>
a merchant who spurns his own wealth, farming and cattle-breeding,
abuses his duty like a guard who takes what has not been given. That
is the wealth of a merchant which the brahmins prescribe. Master
Gotama, the brahmins prescribe this as the wealth of a worker - the
sickle and carrying-pole; a worker who spurns his own wealth, the
sickle and carrying-pole, abuses his duty like a guard who takes what
has not been given. That is the wealth of a worker which the brahmins
prescribe. What does Master Gotama say about this?"</P>
<P  >11.
"Well, brahmin, has all the world authorised the brahmins to
prescribe these four types of wealth?" - [181] "No, Master
Gotama." - "Suppose, brahmin, they were to force a cut of meat</P>
<P  >upon
a poor, penniless, destitute man and tell him: 'Good man, you must
eat this meat and pay for it'; so too, without the consent of those
[other] recluses and brahmins, the brahmins nevertheless prescribe
these four types of wealth.</P>
<P  >12.
"I, brahmin, declare the noble supramundane Dhamma as a person's
own wealth.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote896anc" HREF="#sdendnote896sym"><SUP>dcccxcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
But recollecting his ancient maternal and paternal family lineage, he
is reckoned according to wherever he is reborn.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote897anc" HREF="#sdendnote897sym"><SUP>dcccxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
If he is reborn in a clan of nobles, he is reckoned as a noble; if he
is reborn in a clan of brahmins, he is reckoned as a brahmin; if he
is reborn in a clan of merchants, he is reckoned as a merchant; if he
is reborn in a clan of workers, he is reckoned as a worker. Just as
fire is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it
burns - when fire burns dependent on logs, it is reckoned as a log
fire; when fire burns dependent on faggots, it is reckoned as a
faggot fire; when fire burns dependent on grass, it is reckoned as a
grass fire; when fire burns dependent on cowdung, it is reckoned as a
cowdung fire - so too, brahmin, I declare the noble supramundane
Dhamma as a person's own wealth. But recollecting his ancient
maternal and paternal lineage, he is reckoned according to wherever
he is reborn. If he is reborn … in a clan of workers, he is
reckoned as a worker.</P>
<P  >13.
"If, brahmin, anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth from the home
life into homelessness, and after encountering the Dhamma and
Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata, he abstains from killing
living beings, from taking what is not given, from incelibacy, from
false speech, from malicious speech, from harsh speech, and from
gossip, and is uncovetous, has a mind without ill will, and holds
right view, he is one who is accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma
that is wholesome. [182]</P>
<P  >"If,
brahmin, anyone from a clan of brahmins goes forth … If anyone from
a clan of merchants goes forth … If anyone from a clan of workers
goes forth from the home life into homelessness, and after
encountering the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata,
he abstains from killing living beings … and holds right view, he
is one who is accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma that is
wholesome.</P>
<P  >14.
"What do you think, brahmin? Is only a brahmin capable of
developing a mind of loving-kindness towards a certain region,
without hostility and without ill will, and not a noble, or a
merchant, or a worker?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Whether it be a noble, or a brahmin, or a merchant, or
a worker - those of all four castes are capable of developing a mind
of loving-kindness towards a certain region, without hostility and
without ill will."</P>
<P  >"So
too, brahmin, if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth … (repeat
§13) … he is one who is accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma
that is wholesome.</P>
<P  >15.
"What do you think, brahmin? Is only a brahmin capable of taking a
loofah and bath powder, going to the river, and washing off dust and
dirt, and not a noble, or a merchant, or a worker?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Whether it be a noble, or a brahmin, or a merchant,
[183] or a worker - those of all four castes are capable of taking a
loofah and bath powder, going to the river, and washing off dust and
dirt."</P>
<P  >"So
too, brahmin, if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth … (repeat
§13) … he is one who is accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma
that is wholesome.</P>
<P  >16.
"What do you think, brahmin? Suppose a head-anointed noble king
were to assemble here a hundred men of different birth" … (as
Sutta 93, §13) [184] … "For all fire has a flame, a colour, and
a radiance, and it is possible to use all fire for the purposes of
fire."</P>
<P  >"So
too, brahmin, if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth … (repeat
§13) … he is one who is accomplishing the true way, the Dhamma
that is wholesome."</P>
<P  >17.
When this was said, the brahmin Esukari said to the Blessed One:
"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! … From
today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to
him for refuge for life."</P>
