32. Mahagosinga Sutta - The Greater Discourse in Gosinga</H2>
<P  >[212]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Park of the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood together with a number of very
well-known elder disciples - the venerable Sariputta, the venerable
Maha Moggallana, the venerable Maha Kassapa, the venerable Anuruddha,
the venerable Revata, the venerable Ananda, and other very well-known
elder disciples.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Maha Moggallana rose from
meditation, went to the venerable Maha Kassapa, and said to him:
"Friend Kassapa, let us go to the venerable Sariputta to listen to
the Dhamma." - "Yes, friend," the venerable Maha Kassapa
replied. Then the venerable Maha Moggallana, the venerable Maha
Kassapa, and the venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Sariputta
to listen to the Dhamma.</P>
<P  >3.
The venerable Ananda saw them going to the venerable Sariputta to
listen to the Dhamma. Thereupon he went to the venerable Revata and
said to him: "Friend Revata, those true men are going to the
venerable Sariputta to listen to the Dhamma. Let us also go to the
venerable Sariputta to listen to the Dhamma." - "Yes, friend,"
the venerable Revata replied. Then the venerable Revata and the
venerable Ananda went to the venerable Sariputta to listen to the
Dhamma.</P>
<P  >4.
The venerable Sariputta saw the venerable Revata and the venerable
Ananda coming in the distance and said to the venerable Ananda: "Let
the venerable Ananda come, welcome to the venerable Ananda, the
Blessed One's attendant, who is always in the Blessed One's
presence. Friend Ananda, the Gosinga Salatree Wood is delightful, the
night is moonlit, the sala trees are all in blossom, and heavenly
scents seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend
Ananda, could illuminate the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
friend [213] Sariputta, a bhikkhu has learned much, remembers what he
has learned, and consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as
are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end,
with the right meaning and phrasing, and which affirm a holy life
that is utterly perfect and pure - such teachings as these he has
learned much of, remembered, mastered verbally, investigated with the
mind, and penetrated well by view. And he teaches the Dhamma to the
four assemblies with well-rounded and coherent statements and phrases
for the eradication of the underlying tendencies.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote357anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote357sym"><SUP>ccclvii</SUP></A></SUP>
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood."</P>
<P  >5.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta addressed the venerable
Revata thus: "Friend Revata, the venerable Ananda has spoken
according to his own inspiration.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote358anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote358sym"><SUP>ccclviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Now we ask the venerable Revata: Friend Revata, the Gosinga Sala-tree
Wood is delightful, the night is moonlit, the sala trees are all in
blossom, and heavenly scents seem to be floating in the air. What
kind of bhikkhu, friend Revata, could illuminate this Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
friend Sariputta, a bhikkhu delights in solitary meditation and takes
delight in solitary meditation; he is devoted to internal serenity of
mind, does not neglect meditation, possesses insight, and dwells in
empty huts.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote359anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote359sym"><SUP>ccclix</SUP></A></SUP>
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood."</P>
<P  >6.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta addressed the venerable
Anuruddha thus: "Friend Anuruddha, the venerable Revata has spoken
according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Anuruddha:
Friend Anuruddha, the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood is delightful ... What
kind of bhikkhu, friend Anuruddha, could illuminate this Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
friend Sariputta, with the divine eye, which is purified and
surpasses the human, a bhikkhu surveys a thousand worlds. Just as a
man with good sight, when he has ascended to the upper palace
chamber, might survey a thousand wheel-rims, so too, with the divine
eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, a bhikkhu surveys a
thousand worlds.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote360anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote360sym"><SUP>ccclx</SUP></A></SUP>
That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood."</P>
<P  >7.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta addressed the venerable
Maha Kassapa thus: "Friend Kassapa, the venerable Anuruddha has
spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable
Maha Kassapa: Friend Kassapa, the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood is
delightful ... What kind of bhikkhu, friend Kassapa, [214] could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
friend Sariputta, a bhikkhu is a forest dweller himself and speaks in
praise of forest dwelling; he is an almsfood eater himself and speaks
in praise of eating almsfood; he is a refuserag wearer himself and
speaks in praise of wearing refuse-rag robes; he is a triple-robe
wearer himself and speaks in praise of wearing the triple robe;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote361anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote361sym"><SUP>ccclxi</SUP></A></SUP>
he has few wishes himself and speaks in praise of fewness of wishes;
he is content himself and speaks in praise of contentment; he is
secluded himself and speaks in praise of seclusion; he is aloof from
society himself and speaks in praise of aloofness from society; he is
energetic himself and speaks in praise of arousing energy; he has
attained to virtue himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of
virtue; he has attained to concentration himself and speaks in praise
of the attainment of concentration; he has attained to wisdom himself
and speaks in praise of the attainment of wisdom; he has attained to
deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of
deliverance; he has attained to the knowledge and vision of
deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of the
knowledge and vision of deliverance. That kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood."</P>
<P  >8.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta addressed the venerable
Maha Moggallana thus: "Friend Moggallana, the venerable Maha
Kassapa has spoken according to his own inspiration. Now we ask the
venerable Maha Moggallana: Friend Moggallana, the Gosinga Sala-tree
Wood is delightful ... What kind of bhikkhu, friend Moggallana, could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
friend Sariputta, two bhikkhus engage in a talk on the higher Dhamma<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote362anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote362sym"><SUP>ccclxii</SUP></A></SUP>
and they question each other, and each being questioned by the other
answers without foundering, and their talk rolls on in accordance
with the Dhamma. That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood."</P>
<P  >9.
When this was said, the venerable Maha Moggallana addressed the
venerable Sariputta thus: "Friend Sariputta, we have all spoken
according to our own inspiration. Now we ask the venerable Sariputta:
Friend Sariputta, the Gosinga Sala-tree Wood is delightful, the night
is moonlit, the sala trees are all in blossom, and heavenly scents
seem to be floating in the air. What kind of bhikkhu, friend
Sariputta, could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
friend Moggallana, a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind, he does
not let the mind wield mastery over him. In the morning he abides in
whatever abiding or attainment he wants [215] to abide in during the
morning; at mid-day he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he
wants to abide in at mid-day; in the evening he abides in whatever
abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the evening.
Suppose a king or a king's minister had a chest full of variously
coloured garments. In the morning he could put on whatever pair of
garments he wanted to put on in the morning; at mid-day he could put
on whatever pair of garments he wanted to put on at mid-day; in the
evening he could put on whatever pair of garments he wanted to put on
in the evening. So too, a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind, he
does not let the mind wield mastery over him. In the morning ... at
mid-day ... in the evening he abides in whatever abiding or
attainment he wants to abide in during the evening. That kind of
bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood."</P>
<P  >10.
Then the venerable Sariputta addressed those venerable ones thus:
"Friends, we have all spoken according to our own inspiration. Let
us go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him. As the
Blessed One answers, so let us remember it." - "Yes, friend,"
they replied. Then those venerable ones went to the Blessed One, and
after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side. The venerable
Sariputta said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >11.
"Venerable sir, the venerable Revata and the venerable Ananda came
to me to listen to the Dhamma. I saw them coming in the distance and
[216] said to the venerable Ananda: 'Let the venerable Ananda come,
welcome to the venerable Ananda ... Friend Ananda, the Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood is delightful ... What kind of bhikkhu, friend Ananda,
could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?' When asked,
venerable sir, the venerable Ananda replied: 'Here, friend
Sariputta, a bhikkhu has learned much ... (as in §4) ... That kind
of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.'"</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, Sariputta. Ananda, speaking rightly, should speak just as he
did. For Ananda has learned much, remembers what he has learned, and
consolidates what he has learned. Such teachings as are good in the
beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right
meaning and phrasing, and which affirm a holy life that is utterly
perfect and pure - such teachings as these he has learned much of,
remembered, mastered verbally, investigated with the mind, and
penetrated well by view. And he teaches the Dhamma to the four
assemblies with well-rounded and coherent statements and phrases for
the eradication of the underlying tendencies."</P>
<P  >12.
"When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable
Revata thus: 'Friend Revata ... What kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?' And the venerable Revata
replied: 'Here, friend Sariputta, a bhikkhu delights in solitary
meditation ... (as in §5) ... That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate
this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.'"</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, Sariputta. Revata, speaking rightly, should speak just as he
did. For Revata delights in solitary meditation, takes delight in
solitary meditation, is devoted to internal serenity of mind, does
not neglect meditation, possesses insight, and dwells in empty huts."
[217]</P>
<P  >13.
"When that was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable
Anuruddha thus: 'Friend Anuruddha ... What kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?' And the venerable
Anuruddha replied: 'Here, friend Sariputta, with the divine eye ...
(as in §6) ... That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga
Sala-tree Wood.'"</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, Sariputta. Anuruddha, speaking rightly, should speak just as he
did. For with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the
human, Anuruddha surveys a thousand worlds."</P>
<P  >14.
"When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Maha
Kassapa thus: 'Friend Kassapa ... What kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?' And the venerable Maha
Kassapa replied: 'Here, friend Sariputta, a bhikkhu is a
forest-dweller himself ... (as in §7) ... That kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.'"[218]</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, Sariputta. Kassapa, speaking rightly, should speak just as he
did. For Kassapa is a forest-dweller himself and speaks in praise of
forest dwelling ... he has attained to the knowledge and vision of
deliverance himself and speaks in praise of the attainment of the
knowledge and vision of deliverance."</P>
<P  >15.
"When this was said, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Maha
Moggallana thus: 'Friend Moggallana ... What kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?' And the venerable Maha
Moggallana replied: 'Here, friend Sariputta, two bhikkhus engage in
a talk on the higher Dhamma ... (as in §8) ... That kind of bhikkhu
could illuminate this Gosinga Salatree Wood.'"</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, Sariputta. Moggallana, speaking rightly, should speak just as
he did. For Moggallana is one who talks on the Dhamma."</P>
<P  >16.
When that was said, the venerable Maha Moggallana told the Blessed
One: "Then, venerable sir, I addressed the venerable Sariputta
thus: 'Friend Sariputta ... What kind of bhikkhu could illuminate
this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood?' And the venerable Sariputta replied:
'Here, friend Moggallana, a bhikkhu wields mastery over his mind ...
[219] (as in §9) ... That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this
Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.'"</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, Moggallana. Sariputta, speaking rightly, should speak just as
he did. For Sariputta wields mastery over his mind, he does not let
the mind wield mastery over him. In the morning he abides in whatever
abiding or attainment he wants to abide in during the morning; at
mid-day he abides in whatever abiding or attainment he wants to abide
in at mid-day; in the evening he abides in whatever abiding or
attainment he wants to abide in during the evening."</P>
<P  >17.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta asked the Blessed One:
"Venerable sir, which of us has spoken well?"</P>
<P  >"You
have all spoken well, Sariputta, each in his own way. Hear also from
me what kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood.
Here, Sariputta, when a bhikkhu has returned from his almsround,
after his meal, he sits down, folds his legs crosswise, sets his body
erect, and establishing mindfulness in front of him, resolves: 'I
shall not break this sitting position until through not clinging my
mind is liberated from the taints.' That kind of bhikkhu could
illuminate this Gosinga Sala tree Wood."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote363anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote363sym"><SUP>ccclxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. Those venerable ones were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
