127. Anuruddha Sutta - Anuruddha</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the carpenter Pancakanga addressed a certain man thus: "Come,
good man, go to the venerable Anuruddha, [145] pay homage in my name
with your head at his feet, and say: 'Venerable sir, the carpenter
Pancakanga pays homage with his head at the venerable Anuruddha's
feet and says: "Venerable sir, let the venerable Anuruddha with
three others consent to accept tomorrow's meal from the carpenter
Pancakanga; and let the venerable Anuruddha arrive punctually as the
carpenter Pancakanga is very busy and has much work to do for the
king."'"</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," that man replied, and he went to the venerable Anuruddha.
After paying homage to the venerable Anuruddha, he sat down at one
side and delivered his message. The venerable Anuruddha consented in
silence.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, when the night had ended, it being morning, the venerable
Anuruddha dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went to the
carpenter Pancakanga's house and sat down on a seat made ready.
Then, with his own hands, the carpenter Pancakanga served and
satisfied the venerable Anuruddha with the various kinds of good
food. Then, when the venerable Anuruddha had eaten and had withdrawn
his hand from his bowl, the carpenter Pancakanga took a low seat, sat
down at one side, and said to the venerable Anuruddha:</P>
<P  >4.
"Here, venerable sir, elder bhikkhus have come to me and said:
'Householder, develop the immeasurable deliverance of mind'; and
some elders have said: 'Householder, develop the exalted
deliverance of mind.' Venerable sir, the immeasurable deliverance
of mind and the exalted deliverance of mind<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1180anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1180sym"><SUP>mclxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
-</P>
<P  >are
these states different in meaning and [146] different in name, or are
they one in meaning and different only in name?"</P>
<P  >5.
"Explain it as you see it, householder. Afterwards it will be
cleared up for you."</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, I think thus: the immeasurable deliverance of mind and the
exalted deliverance of mind - these states are one in meaning and
different only in name."</P>
<P  >6.
"Householder, the immeasurable deliverance of mind and the exalted
deliverance of mind - these states are different in meaning and
different in name. And it should be understood as follows how these
states are different in meaning and different in name.</P>
<P  >7.
"What, householder, is the immeasurable deliverance of mind? Here a
bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise
the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to
himself, he abides pervading the all encompassing world with a mind
imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without
hostility and without ill will. He abides pervading one quarter with
a mind imbued with compassion ... He abides pervading one quarter
with a mind imbued with appreciative joy ... He abides pervading one
quarter with a mind imbued with equanimity ... abundant, exalted,
immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will. This is called
the immeasurable deliverance of mind.</P>
<P  >8.
"And what, householder, is the exalted deliverance of mind? Here a
bhikkhu abides resolved upon an area the size of the root of one
tree, pervading it as exalted: this is called the exalted deliverance
of mind.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1181anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1181sym"><SUP>mclxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
Here a bhikkhu abides resolved upon an area the size of the roots of
two or three trees, pervading it as exalted: this too is called the
exalted deliverance of mind. Here a bhikkhu abides resolved upon an
area the size of one village, pervading it as exalted ... [147] ...
an area the size of two or three villages ... an area the size of one
major kingdom ... an area the size of two or three major kingdoms ...
an area the size of the earth bounded by the ocean, pervading it as
exalted: this too is called the exalted deliverance of mind. It is in
this way, householder, that it can be understood how these states are
different in meaning and different in name.</P>
<P  >9.
"There are, householder, these four kinds of reappearance [in a
future state of] being.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1182anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1182sym"><SUP>mclxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
What four? Here someone abides resolved upon and pervading 'limited
radiance'; on the dissolution of the body, after death, he
reappears in the company of the gods of Limited Radiance. Here
someone abides resolved upon and pervading 'immeasurable radiance';
on the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in the
company of the gods of Immeasurable Radiance. Here someone abides
resolved upon and pervading 'defiled radiance'; on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in the company of
the gods of Defiled Radiance. Here someone abides resolved upon and
pervading 'pure radiance'; on the dissolution of the body, after
death, he reappears in the company of the gods of Pure Radiance.
These are the four kinds of reappearance [in a future state of]
being.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1183anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1183sym"><SUP>mclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >10.
"There is an occasion, householder, when those deities assemble in
one place. When they have assembled in one place, a difference in
their colour can be discerned but no difference in their radiance.
Just as, if a man were to bring several oil-lamps into a house, a
difference in the flames of the lamps might be discerned but no
difference in their radiance; so too, there is an occasion when those
deities assemble in one place [148] ... but no difference in their
radiance.</P>
<P  >11.
"There is an occasion, householder, when those deities disperse
from there. When they have dispersed, a difference in their colours
can be discerned and also a difference in their radiance. Just as, if
the man were to remove those several oil-lamps from that house, a
difference might be discerned in the flames of the lamps and also a
difference in their radiance; so too, there is an occasion when those
deities disperse from there ... and also a difference in their
radiance.</P>
<P  >12.
"It does not occur to those deities: 'This [life] of ours is
permanent, everlasting, and eternal,' yet wherever those deities
settle down, there they find delight. Just as, when flies are being
carried along on a carrying-pole or on a basket, it does not occur to
them: 'This [life] of ours is permanent, everlasting, or eternal,'
yet wherever those flies settle down, there they find delight; so
too, it does not occur to those deities ... yet wherever they settle
down, there they find delight."</P>
<P  >13.
When this was said, the venerable Abhiya Kaccana said to the
venerable Anuruddha: "Good, venerable Anuruddha, yet I have
something further to ask:.Are all those radiant ones deities of
Limited Radiance, or are some of them deities of Immeasurable
Radiance?"</P>
<P  >"By
reason of the factor [responsible for rebirth], friend Kaccana, some
are deities of Limited Radiance, some deities of Immeasurable
Radiance."</P>
<P  >14.
"Venerable Anuruddha, what is the cause and reason why among those
deities that have reappeared in a single order of gods, [149] some
are deities of Limited Radiance, some deities of Immeasurable
Radiance?"</P>
<P  >"As
to that, friend Kaccana, I shall ask you a question in return. Answer
it as you choose. What do you think, friend Kaccana? When one bhikkhu
abides resolved upon an area the size of the root of one tree,
pervading it as exalted, and another bhikkhu abides resolved upon the
area the size of the roots of two or three trees, pervading it as
exalted - which of these types of mental development is more
exalted?" - "The second, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, friend Kaccana? When one bhikkhu abides resolved upon
an area the size of the roots of two or three trees, pervading it as
exalted, and another bhikkhu abides resolved upon an area the size of
one village, pervading it as exalted ... an area the size of one
village and an area the size of two or three villages ... an area the
size of two or three villages [150] and an area the size of one major
kingdom ... an area the size of one major kingdom and an area the
size of two or three major kingdoms ... an area the size of two or
three major kingdoms and an area the size of the earth bounded by the
ocean, pervading it as exalted - which of these two types of mental
development is more exalted?" - "The second, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"This
is the cause and reason, friend Kaccana, why among those deities that
have reappeared in a single order of gods, some are deities of
Limited Radiance, some deities of Immeasurable Radiance."</P>
<P  >15.
"Good, venerable Anuruddha, yet I have something further to ask:
Are all those radiant ones deities of Defiled Radiance, or are some
of them deities of Pure Radiance?" [151]</P>
<P  >"By
reason of the factor [responsible for rebirth], friend Kaccana, some
are deities of Defiled Radiance, some deities of Pure Radiance."</P>
<P  >16.
"Venerable Anuruddha, what is the cause and reason why among those
deities that have reappeared in a single order of gods, some are
deities of Defiled Radiance, some deities of Pure Radiance?"</P>
<P  >"As
to that, friend Kaccana, I shall give a simile, for some wise men
here understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile.
Suppose an oil-lamp is burning with impure oil and an impure wick;
because of the impurity of its oil and its wick it burns dimly. So
too, here a bhikkhu abides resolved upon and pervading [an area with]
a defiled radiance. His bodily inertia has not fully subsided, his
sloth and torpor have not been fully eliminated, his restlessness and
remorse have not been fully removed; because of this he meditates, as
it were, dimly.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1184anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1184sym"><SUP>mclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in the
company of the gods of Defiled Radiance.</P>
<P  >"Suppose
an oil-lamp is burning with pure oil and a pure wick; because of the
purity of its oil and its wick it does not burn dimly. So too, here a
bhikkhu abides resolved upon and pervading [an area with] a pure

<P  >"This
is the cause and reason, friend Kaccana, why among those deities that
have reappeared in the same order of gods, some are deities of
Defiled Radiance, some deities of Pure Radiance."</P>
<P  >17.
When this was said, the venerable Abhiya Kaccana said to the
venerable Anuruddha: "Good, venerable Anuruddha. The venerable
Anuruddha does not say: 'Thus have I heard' or 'It should be
thus.' Rather, the venerable Anuruddha says: 'These gods are thus
and those gods are such.' It occurs to me, venerable sir, that the
venerable Anuruddha certainly has associated with those deities and
talked with them and held conversations with them."</P>
<P  >"Certainly,
friend Kaccana, your words are offensive and discourteous, but still
I will answer you. Over a long time I have associated with those
deities and talked with them and held conversations with them."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1185anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1185sym"><SUP>mclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >18.
When this was said, the venerable Abhiya Kaccana said to the
carpenter Pancakanga: "It is a gain for you, householder, it is a
great gain for you that you have abandoned your state of doubt and
have had the opportunity to hear this discourse on the Dhamma."</P>
