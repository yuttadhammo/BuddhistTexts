68. Nalakapana Sutta - At Nalakapana</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Kosalan country at Nalakapana in the Palasa Grove.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion many very well-known clansmen had gone forth out
of faith from the home life into homelessness under the Blessed One -
the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya, the venerable
Kimbila, the venerable Bhagu, the venerable Kundadhana, the venerable
Revata, the venerable Ananda, and other very well-known clansmen.</P>
<P  >3.
And on that occasion the Blessed One was [463] seated in the open
surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, referring to those
clansmen, he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, those clansmen
who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness
under me - do they delight in the holy life?”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, those bhikkhus were silent.</P>
<P  >A
second and a third time, referring to those clansmen, he addressed
the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus, those clansmen who have gone forth
out of faith from the home life into homelessness under me - do they
delight in the holy life?”</P>
<P  >For
a second and third time, those bhikkhus were silent.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One considered thus: “Suppose I question those
clansmen?”</P>
<P  >Then
he addressed the venerable Anuruddha thus: “Anuruddha, do you all
delight in the holy life?”</P>
<P  >“Surely,
venerable sir, we delight in the holy life.”</P>
<P  >5.
“Good, good, Anuruddha! It is proper for all you clansmen who have
gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness to
delight in the holy life. As you are still endowed with the blessing
of youth, black-haired young men in the prime of life, you could have
indulged in sensual pleasures, yet you have gone forth from the home
life into homelessness. It is not because you have been driven by
kings that you have gone forth from the home life into homelessness,
or because you have been driven by thieves, or owing to debt, fear,
or want of a livelihood. Rather, did you not go forth out of faith
from the home life into homelessness after considering thus: ‘I am
a victim of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to suffering.
Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known’?”
- “Yes, venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >6.
“What should be done, Anuruddha, by a clansman who has gone forth
thus? While he still does not attain to the rapture and pleasure that
are secluded from sensual pleasures and secluded from unwholesome
states, or to something more peaceful than that,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote688anc" HREF="#sdendnote688sym"><SUP>dclxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
covetousness invades his mind and remains, ill will invades his mind
and remains, sloth and torpor invade his mind and remain,
restlessness and remorse invade his mind and remain, doubt invades
[464] his mind and remains, discontent invades his mind and remains,
weariness invades his mind and remains. That is so while he still
does not attain to the rapture and pleasure that are secluded from
sensual pleasures and secluded from unwholesome states, or to
something more peaceful than that. When he attains to the rapture and
pleasure that are secluded from sensual pleasures and secluded from
unwholesome states, or to something more peaceful than that,
covetousness does not invade his mind and remain, ill will … sloth
and torpor … restlessness and remorse … doubt … discontent …
weariness does not invade his mind and remain. That is so when he
attains to the rapture and pleasure that are secluded from sensual
pleasures and secluded from unwholesome states, or to something more
peaceful than that.</P>
<P  >7.
“How then, Anuruddha, do you all think of me in this way: ‘The
Tathagata has not abandoned the taints that defile, bring renewal of
being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth,
ageing, and death. That is why the Tathagata uses one thing after
reflecting, endures another thing after reflecting, avoids another
thing after reflecting, and removes another thing after
reflecting’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote689anc" HREF="#sdendnote689sym"><SUP>dclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir, we do not think of the Blessed One in that way. We
think of the Blessed One in this way: ‘The Tathagata has abandoned
the taints that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen
in suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death. That is
why the Tathagata uses one thing after reflecting, endures another
thing after reflecting, avoids another thing after reflecting, and
removes another thing after reflecting.”</P>
<P  >“Good,
good, Anuruddha! The Tathagata has abandoned the taints that defile,
bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to
future birth, ageing, and death; he has cut them off at the root,
made them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are no
longer subject to future arising. Just as a palm tree whose crown is
cut off is incapable of further growth, so too, the Tathagata has
abandoned the taints that defile … cut them off at the root, made
them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they are no
longer subject to future arising.</P>
<P  >8.
“What do you think, Anuruddha? What purpose does the Tathagata see
that when a disciple has died, he declares his reappearance thus:
‘So-and-so has reappeared in such-and-such a place; so-and-so has
reappeared in such-and-such a place’?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote690anc" HREF="#sdendnote690sym"><SUP>dcxc</SUP></A></SUP>
[465]</P>
<P  >“Venerable
sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the
Blessed One, have the Blessed One as their resort. It would be good
if the Blessed One would explain the meaning of these words. Having
heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it.”</P>
<P  >9.
“Anuruddha, it is not for the purpose of scheming to deceive people
or for the purpose of flattering people or for the purpose of gain,
honour, or renown, or with the thought, ‘Let people know me to be
thus,’ that when a disciple has died, the Tathagata declares his
reappearance thus: ‘So-and-so has reappeared in such-and-such a
place; so-and-so has reappeared in such-and-such a place.’ Rather,
it is because there are faithful clansmen inspired and gladdened by
what is lofty, who when they hear that, direct their minds to such a
state, and that leads to their welfare and happiness for a long time.</P>
<P  >10.
“Here a bhikkhu hears thus: ‘The bhikkhu named so-andso has died;
the Blessed One has declared of him: “He was established in final
knowledge.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote691anc" HREF="#sdendnote691sym"><SUP>dcxci</SUP></A></SUP>
And he has either seen that venerable one for himself or heard it
said of him: ‘That venerable one’s virtue was thus, his state [of
concentration] was thus, his wisdom was thus, his abiding [in
attainments] was thus, his deliverance was thus.’ Recollecting his
faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom, he directs his mind
to such a state. In this way a bhikkhu has a comfortable abiding.</P>
<P  >11.
“Here a bhikkhu hears thus: ‘The bhikkhu named so-andso has died;
the Blessed One has declared of him: “With the destruction of the
five lower fetters he has reappeared spontaneously [in the Pure
Abodes] and there will attain final Nibbana without ever returning
from that world.’“And he has either seen that venerable one for
himself … he directs his mind to such a state. In this way too a
bhikkhu has a comfortable abiding.</P>
<P  >12.
“Here a bhikkhu hears thus: ‘The bhikkhu named so-andso has died;
the Blessed One has declared of him: “With the destruction of three
fetters and with the attenuation of lust, hate, and delusion, he has

of suffering.’“And he has either seen that venerable one for
himself … [466] he directs his mind to such a state. In this way
too a bhikkhu has a comfortable abiding.</P>
<P  >13.
“Here a bhikkhu hears thus: ‘The bhikkhu named so-andso has died;
the Blessed One has declared of him: “With the destruction of three
fetters he has become a stream-enterer, no longer subject to
perdition, bound [for deliverance], headed for enlightenment.’“And
he has either seen that venerable one for himself … he directs his
mind to such a state. In this way too a bhikkhu has a comfortable
abiding.</P>
<P  >14.
“Here a bhikkhuni hears thus: ‘The bhikkhuni named soand-so has
died; the Blessed One has declared of her: “She was established in
final knowledge.’“And she has either seen that sister for herself
or heard it said of her: ‘That sister’s virtue was thus, her
state [of concentration] was thus, her wisdom was thus, her abiding
[in attainments] was thus, her deliverance was thus.’ Recollecting
her faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom, she directs her
mind to such a state. In this way a bhikkhuni has a comfortable
abiding.</P>
<P  >15.
“Here a bhikkhuni hears thus: ‘The bhikkhuni named so and-so has
died; the Blessed One has declared of her: “With the destruction of
the five lower fetters she has reappeared spontaneously [in the Pure
Abodes] and will there attain final Nibbana without ever returning
from that world.” …</P>
<P  >16.

And she has either seen that sister for herself … she directs her
mind to such a state. In this way too a bhikkhu i has a comfortable
abiding.</P>
<P  >18.
“Here a man lay follower hears thus: ‘The man lay follower named
so-and-so has died; the Blessed One has declared of him: “With the
destruction of the five lower fetters he has reappeared spontaneously
[in the Pure Abodes] and will there attain final Nibbana without ever
returning from that world.” …</P>

“So, Anuruddha, it is not for the purpose of scheming to deceive
people or for the purpose of flattering people or for the purpose of
gain, honour, and renown, or with the thought, ‘Let people know me
to be thus,’ that when a disciple has died, the Tathagata declares
his reappearance thus: ‘So-and-so has reappeared in such-and-such a
place; so-and-so has reappeared in such-and-such a place.’ Rather,
it is because there are faithful clansmen inspired and gladdened by
what is lofty, who when they hear that, direct their minds to such a
state, and that leads to their welfare and happiness for a long
time.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Anuruddha was satisfied
and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
