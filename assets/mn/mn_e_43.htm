43. Mahavedalla Sutta - The Greater Series of Questions and Answers</H2>
<P  >[292]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.</P>
<P  >Then,
when it was evening, the venerable Maha Kotthita rose from
meditation, went to the venerable Sariputta, and exchanged greetings
with him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote428anc" HREF="#sdendnote428sym"><SUP>cdxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and said to the venerable Sariputta:</P>
<H3 >(WISDOM)</H3>
<P  >2.
“‘One who is unwise, one who is unwise’ is said, friend. With
reference to what is this said, ‘one who is unwise’?”</P>
<P  >“‘One
does not wisely understand, one does not wisely understand,’
friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is unwise.’ And what
doesn’t one wisely understand? One does not wisely understand:
‘This is suffering’; one does not wisely understand: ‘This is
the origin of suffering’; one does not wisely understand: ‘This
is the cessation of suffering’; one does not wisely understand:
‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ ‘One
does not wisely understand, one does not wisely understand,’
friend; that is why it is said, ‘one who is unwise.’“</P>
<P  >Saying,
“Good, friend,” the venerable Maha Kotthita delighted and
rejoiced in the venerable Sariputta’s words. Then he asked him a
further question:</P>
<P  >3.
“‘One who is wise, one who is wise,’ is said, friend. With
reference to what is this said, ‘one who is wise’?”</P>
<P  >“‘One
wisely understands, one wisely understands,’ friend; that is why it
is said, ‘one who is wise.’ What does one wisely understand? One
wisely understands: ‘This is suffering’; one wisely understands:
‘This is the origin of suffering’; one wisely understands: ‘This
is the cessation of suffering’; one wisely understands: ‘This is
the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ ‘One wisely
understands, one wisely understands,’ friend; that is why it is
said, ‘one who is wise.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote429anc" HREF="#sdendnote429sym"><SUP>cdxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(CONSCIOUSNESS)</H3>
<P  >4.
“‘Consciousness, consciousness’ is said, friend. With reference
to what is ‘consciousness’ said?”</P>
<P  >“‘It
cognizes, it cognizes,’ friend; that is why ‘consciousness’ is
said.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote430anc" HREF="#sdendnote430sym"><SUP>cdxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
What does it cognize? It cognizes: ‘[This is] pleasant’; it
cognizes: ‘[This is] painful’; it cognizes: ‘[This is]
neitherpainful-nor-pleasant.’ ‘It cognizes, it cognizes,’
friend; that is why ‘consciousness’ is said.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote431anc" HREF="#sdendnote431sym"><SUP>cdxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
“Wisdom and consciousness, friend - are these states conjoined or
disjoined? And is it possible to separate each of these states from
the other in order to describe the difference between them?”</P>
<P  >“Wisdom
and consciousness, friend - these states are conjoined, not
disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states from
the other in order to describe the difference between them. For what
one wisely understands, that one cognizes, and what one cognizes,
that one wisely understands. [293] That is why these states are
conjoined, not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of
these states from the other in order to describe the difference
between them.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote432anc" HREF="#sdendnote432sym"><SUP>cdxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
“What is the difference, friend, between wisdom and consciousness,
these states that are conjoined, not disjoined?”</P>
<P  >“The
difference, friend, between wisdom and consciousness, these states
that are conjoined, not disjoined, is this: wisdom is to be
developed, consciousness is to be fully understood.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote433anc" HREF="#sdendnote433sym"><SUP>cdxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(FEELING)</H3>
<P  >7.
“‘Feeling, feeling’ is said, friend. With reference to what is
‘feeling’ said?”</P>
<P  >“‘It
feels, it feels,’ friend; that is why ‘feeling’ is said. What
does it feel? It feels pleasure, it feels pain, it feels
neither-pain-norpleasure. ‘It feels, it feels,’ friend, that is
why ‘feeling’ is said. “<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote434anc" HREF="#sdendnote434sym"><SUP>cdxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(PERCEPTION)</H3>
<P  >8.
“‘Perception, perception,’ is said, friend. With reference to
what is ‘perception’ said?”</P>
<P  >“‘It
perceives, it perceives,’ friend; that is why ‘perception’ is
said. What does it perceive? It perceives blue, it perceives yellow,
it perceives red, and it perceives white. ‘It perceives, it
perceives,’ friend; that is why ‘perception’ is said.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote435anc" HREF="#sdendnote435sym"><SUP>cdxxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9.
“Feeling, perception, and consciousness, friend - are these states
conjoined or disjoined? And is it possible to separate each of these
states from the others in order to describe the difference between
them?”</P>
<P  >“Feeling,
perception, and consciousness, friend - these states are conjoined,
not disjoined, and it is impossible to separate each of these states
from the others in order to describe the difference between them. For
what one feels, that one perceives; and what one perceives, that one
cognizes. That is why these states are conjoined, not disjoined, and
it is impossible to separate each of these states from the others in
order to describe the difference between them.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote436anc" HREF="#sdendnote436sym"><SUP>cdxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(KNOWABLE BY MIND ALONE)</H3>
<P  >10.
“Friend, what can be known by purified mind-consciousness released
from the five faculties?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
by purified mind-consciousness released from the five faculties the
base of infinite space can be known thus: ‘Space is infinite’;
the base of infinite consciousness can be known thus: ‘Consciousness
is infinite’; and the base of nothingness can be known thus: ‘There
is nothing.’”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote437anc" HREF="#sdendnote437sym"><SUP>cdxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
“Friend, with what does one understand a state that can be known?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
one understands a state that can be known with the eye of wisdom.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote438anc" HREF="#sdendnote438sym"><SUP>cdxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
“Friend, what is the purpose of wisdom?”</P>
<P  >“The
purpose of wisdom, friend, is direct knowledge, its purpose is full
understanding, its purpose is abandoning.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote439anc" HREF="#sdendnote439sym"><SUP>cdxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(RIGHT VIEW)</H3>
<P  >[294]
13. “Friend, how many conditions are there for the arising of right
view?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
there are two conditions for the arising of right view: the voice of
another and wise attention. These are the two conditions for the
arising of right view.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote440anc" HREF="#sdendnote440sym"><SUP>cdxl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
“Friend, by how many factors is right view assisted when it has
deliverance of mind for its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit
and benefit, when it has deliverance by wisdom for its fruit,
deliverance by wisdom for its fruit and benefit?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
right view is assisted by five factors when it has deliverance of
mind for its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit and benefit,
when it has deliverance by wisdom for its fruit, deliverance by
wisdom for its fruit and benefit. Here, friend, right view is
assisted by virtue, learning, discussion, serenity, and insight.
Right view assisted by these five factors has deliverance of mind for
its fruit, deliverance of mind for its fruit and benefit; it has
deliverance by wisdom for its fruit, deliverance by wisdom for its
fruit and benefit.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote441anc" HREF="#sdendnote441sym"><SUP>cdxli</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(BEING)</H3>
<P  >15.
“Friend, how many kinds of being are there?”</P>
<P  >“There
are these three kinds of being, friend: sense-sphere being,
fine-material being, and immaterial being.”</P>
<P  >16.
“Friend, how is renewal of being in the future generated?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
renewal of being in the future is generated through the delighting in
this and that on the part of beings who are hindered by ignorance and
fettered by craving.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote442anc" HREF="#sdendnote442sym"><SUP>cdxlii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >17.
“Friend, how is renewal of being in the future not generated?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
with the fading away of ignorance, with the arising of true
knowledge, and with the cessation of craving, renewal of being in the
future is not generated.”</P>
<H3 >(THE FIRST JHANA)</H3>
<P  >18.
“Friend, what is the first jhana?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
friend, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. This is called the first
jhana.”</P>
<P  >19.
“Friend, how many factors does the first jhana have?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
the first jhana has five factors. Here, when a bhikkhu has entered
upon the first jhana, there occur applied thought, sustained thought,
rapture, pleasure, and unification of mind. That is how the first
jhana has five factors.”</P>
<P  >20.
“Friend, how many factors are abandoned in the first jhana and how
many factors are possessed?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
in the first jhana five factors are abandoned and five factors are
possessed. Here, when a bhikkhu has entered upon the first jhana,
sensual desire is abandoned, ill will is abandoned, sloth and torpor
are abandoned, restlessness and remorse [295] are abandoned, and
doubt is abandoned; and there occur applied thought, sustained
thought, rapture, pleasure, and unification of mind. That is how in
the first jhana five factors are abandoned and five factors are
possessed.”</P>
<H3 >(THE FIVE FACULTIES)</H3>
<P  >21.
“Friend, these five faculties each have a separate field, a
separate domain, and do not experience each other’s field and
domain, that is, the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty,
the tongue faculty, and the body faculty. Now of these five
faculties, each having a separate field, a separate domain, not
experiencing each other’s field and domain, what is their resort,
what experiences their fields and domains?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote443anc" HREF="#sdendnote443sym"><SUP>cdxliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Friend,
these five faculties each have a separate field, a separate domain,
and do not experience each other’s field and domain, that is, the
eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty,
and the body faculty. Now these five faculties, each having a
separate field, a separate domain, not experiencing each other’s
field and domain, have mind as their resort, and mind experiences
their fields and domains.”</P>
<P  >22.
“Friend, as to these five faculties - that is, the eye faculty, the
ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, and the body
faculty - what do these five faculties stand in dependence on?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
as to these five faculties - that is, the eye faculty, the ear
faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, and the body faculty -
these five faculties stand in dependence on vitality.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote444anc" HREF="#sdendnote444sym"><SUP>cdxliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Friend,
what does vitality stand in dependence on?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
as to these five faculties - that is, the eye faculty, the ear
faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, and the body faculty -
these five faculties stand in dependence on vitality.’“</P>
<P  >“Friend,
what does vitality stand in dependence on?”</P>
<P  >“Vitality
stands in dependence on heat.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote445anc" HREF="#sdendnote445sym"><SUP>cdxlv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Friend,
what does heat stand in dependence on?”</P>
<P  >“Heat
stands in dependence on vitality.”</P>
<P  >“Just
now, friend, we understood the venerable Sariputta to have said:
‘Vitality stands in dependence on heat’; and now we understand
him to say: ‘Heat stands in dependence on vitality.’ How should
the meaning of these statements be regarded?”</P>
<P  >“In
that case, friend, I shall give you a simile, for some wise men here
understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile. Just as
when an oil-lamp is burning, its radiance is seen in dependence on
its flame and its flame is seen in dependence on its radiance; so
too, vitality stands in dependence on heat and heat stands in
dependence on vitality.”</P>
<H3 >(VITAL FORMATIONS)</H3>
<P  >23.
“Friend, are vital formations states of feeling or are vital
formations one thing and states of feeling another?” [296]</P>
<P  >“Vital
formations, friend, are not states of feeling.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote446anc" HREF="#sdendnote446sym"><SUP>cdxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
If vital formations were states of feeling, then when a bhikkhu has
entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling, he would not be
seen to emerge from it. Because vital formations are one thing and
states of feeling another, when a bhikkhu has entered upon the
cessation of perception and feeling, he can be seen to emerge from
it.”</P>
<P  >24.
“Friend, when this body is bereft of how many states is it then
discarded and forsaken, left lying senseless like a log?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote447anc" HREF="#sdendnote447sym"><SUP>cdxlvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Friend,
when this body is bereft of three states - vitality, heat, and
consciousness - it is then discarded and forsaken, left lying
senseless like a log.”</P>
<P  >25.
“Friend, what is the difference between one who is dead, who has
completed his time, and a bhikkhu who has entered upon the cessation
of perception and feeling?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
in the case of one who is dead, who has completed his time, his
bodily formations have ceased and subsided, his verbal formations
have ceased and subsided, his mental formations have ceased and
subsided, his vitality is exhausted, his heat has been dissipated,
and his faculties are fully broken up. In the case of a bhikkhu who
has entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling, his bodily
formations have ceased and subsided, his verbal formations have
ceased and subsided, his mental formations have ceased and subsided,
but his vitality is not exhausted, his heat has not been dissipated,
and his faculties become exceptionally clear.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote448anc" HREF="#sdendnote448sym"><SUP>cdxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the difference between one who is dead, who has completed his
time, and a bhikkhu who has entered upon the cessation of perception
and feeling.”</P>
<H3 >(DELIVERANCE OF MIND)</H3>
<P  >26.
“Friend, how many conditions are there for the attainment of the
neither-painful-nor-pleasant deliverance of mind?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
there are four conditions for the attainment of the
neither-painful-nor-pleasant deliverance of mind: here, with the
abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance
of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth
jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness
due to equanimity. These are the four conditions for the attainment
of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant deliverance of mind.”</P>
<P  >27.
“Friend, how many conditions are there for the attainment of the
signless deliverance of mind?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
there are two conditions for the attainment of the signless
deliverance of mind: non-attention to all signs and attention to the
signless element. These are the two conditions for the attainment of
the signless deliverance of mind.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote449anc" HREF="#sdendnote449sym"><SUP>cdxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >28.
“Friend, how many conditions are there for the persistence of the
signless deliverance of mind?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
there are three conditions for the persistence of the signless
deliverance of mind: [297] non-attention to all signs, attention to
the signless element, and the prior determination [of its duration].
These are the three conditions for the persistence of the signless
deliverance of mind.”</P>
<P  >29.
“Friend, how many conditions are there for emergence from the
signless deliverance of mind?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
there are two conditions for emergence from the signless deliverance
of mind: attention to all signs and non-attention to the signless
element. These are the two conditions for emergence from the signless
deliverance of mind.”</P>
<P  >30.
“Friend, the immeasurable deliverance of mind, the deliverance of
mind through nothingness, the deliverance of mind through voidness,
and the signless deliverance of mind: are these states different in
meaning and different in name, or are they one in meaning and
different only in name?”</P>
<P  >“Friend,
the immeasurable deliverance of mind, the deliverance of mind through
nothingness, the deliverance of mind through voidness, and the
signless deliverance of mind: there is a way in which these states
are different in meaning and different in name, and there is a way in
which they are one in meaning and different only in name.</P>
<P  >31.
“What, friend, is the way in which these states are different in
meaning and different in name? Here a bhikkhu abides pervading one
quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second,
likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and
everywhere, and to all as to himself, he abides pervading the
all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness,
abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill
will. He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with
compassion … He abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued
with appreciative joy … He abides pervading one quarter with a mind
imbued with equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third,
likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to
all as to himself, he abides pervading the all-encompassing world
with a mind imbued with equanimity, abundant, exalted, immeasurable,
without hostility and without ill will. This is called the
immeasurable deliverance of mind.</P>
<P  >32.
“And what, friend, is the deliverance of mind through nothingness?
Here, with the complete surmounting of the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the base of nothingness. This is called the
deliverance of mind through nothingness.</P>
<P  >33.
“And what, friend, is the deliverance of mind through voidness?
Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an
empty hut, reflects thus: ‘This is void of a self or of what
belongs to a self.’ [298] This is called the deliverance of mind
through voidness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote450anc" HREF="#sdendnote450sym"><SUP>cdl</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >34.
“And what, friend, is the signless deliverance of mind? Here, with
non-attention to all signs, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the
signless concentration of mind. This is called the signless
deliverance of mind.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote451anc" HREF="#sdendnote451sym"><SUP>cdli</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the way in which these states are different in meaning and
different in name.</P>
<P  >35.
“And what, friend, is the way in which these states are one in
meaning and different only in name? Lust is a maker of measurement,
hate is a maker of measurement, delusion is a maker of measurement.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote452anc" HREF="#sdendnote452sym"><SUP>cdlii</SUP></A></SUP>
In a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, these are abandoned, cut off
at the root, made like a palm stump, done away with so that they are
no longer subject to future arising. Of all the kinds of immeasurable
deliverance of mind, the unshakeable deliverance of mind is
pronounced the best. Now that unshakeable deliverance of mind is void
of lust, void of hate, void of delusion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote453anc" HREF="#sdendnote453sym"><SUP>cdliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >36.
“Lust is a something, hate is a something, delusion is a
something.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote454anc" HREF="#sdendnote454sym"><SUP>cdliv</SUP></A></SUP>
In a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, these are abandoned, cut off
at the root, made like a palm stump, done away with so that they are
no longer subject to future arising. Of all the kinds of deliverance
of mind through nothingness, the unshakeable deliverance of mind is
pronounced the best.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote455anc" HREF="#sdendnote455sym"><SUP>cdlv</SUP></A></SUP>Now
that unshakeable deliverance of mind is void of lust, void of hate,
void of delusion.</P>
<P  >37.
“Lust is a maker of signs, hate is a maker of signs, delusion is a
maker of signs.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote456anc" HREF="#sdendnote456sym"><SUP>cdlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
In a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed, these are abandoned, cut off
at the root, made like a palm stump, done away with so that they are
no longer subject to future arising. Of all the kinds of signless
deliverance of mind, the unshakeable deliverance of mind is
pronounced the best.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote457anc" HREF="#sdendnote457sym"><SUP>cdlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Now that unshakeable deliverance of mind is void of lust, void of
hate, void of delusion. This is the way in which these states are one
in meaning and different only in name.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote458anc" HREF="#sdendnote458sym"><SUP>cdlviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the venerable Sariputta said. The venerable Maha Kotthita was
satisfied and delighted in the venerable Sariputta’s words.</P>
