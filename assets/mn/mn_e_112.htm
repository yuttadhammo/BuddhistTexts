112. Chabbisodhana Sutta - The Sixfold Purity</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu makes a declaration of final knowledge
thus: 'I understand: Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to
any state of being.'</P>
<P  >3.
"That bhikkhu's words should neither be approved nor disapproved.
Without approving or disapproving, a question should be put thus:
'Friend, there are four kinds of expression rightly proclaimed by
the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully
enlightened. What four? Telling the seen as it is seen; telling the
heard as it is heard; telling the sensed as it is sensed; telling the
cognized as it is cognized.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1056anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1056sym"><SUP>mlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
[30] These, friend, are the four kinds of expression rightly
proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and
fully enlightened. How does the venerable one know, how does he see,
regarding these four kinds of expression, so that through not
clinging his mind is liberated from the taints?'</P>
<P  >4.
"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one with taints destroyed, who has
lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden,
reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is
completely liberated through final knowledge, this is the nature of
his answer:</P>
<P  >"'Friends,
regarding the seen I abide unattracted, unrepelled, independent,
detached, free, dissociated, with a mind rid of barriers.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1057anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1057sym"><SUP>mlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Regarding the heard ... Regarding the sensed.. Regarding the cognized
I abide unattracted, unrepelled, independent, detached, free,
dissociated, with a mind rid of barriers. It is by knowing thus,
seeing thus, regarding these four kinds of expression, that through
not clinging my mind is liberated from the taints.'</P>
<P  >5.
"Saying 'good,' one may delight and rejoice in that bhikkhu's
words. Having done so, a further question may be put thus:</P>
<P  >"'Friend,
there are these five aggregates affected by clinging, rightly
proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and
fully enlightened. What five? They are the material form aggregate
affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the
perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate
affected by clinging, and the consciousness aggregate affected by
clinging. These, friend, are the five aggregates affected by
clinging, rightly proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened. How does the venerable one know,
how does he see, regarding these five aggregates affected by
clinging, so that through not clinging his mind is liberated from the
taints?'</P>
<P  >6.
"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one with taints destroyed ... and is
completely liberated through final knowledge, this is the nature of
his answer:</P>
<P  >"'Friends,
having known material form to be feeble, fading away, and
comfortless, [31] with the destruction, fading away, cessation,
giving up, and relinquishing of attraction and clinging regarding
material form, of mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying
tendencies regarding material form,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1058anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1058sym"><SUP>mlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
I have understood that my mind is liberated.</P>
<P  >"'Friends,
having known feeling ... Having known perception ... Having known
formations ... Having known consciousness to be feeble, fading away,
and comfortless, with the destruction, fading away, cessation, giving
up, and relinquishing of attraction and clinging regarding
consciousness, of mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying
tendencies regarding consciousness, I have understood that my mind is
liberated.</P>
<P  >"'It
is by knowing thus, seeing thus, regarding these five aggregates
affected by clinging, that through not clinging my mind is liberated
from the taints.'</P>
<P  >7.
"Saying 'good,' one may delight and rejoice in that bhikkhu's
words. Having done so, a further question may be put thus:</P>
<P  >"'Friend,
there are these six elements rightly proclaimed by the Blessed One
who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened. What six?
They are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the
air element, the space element, and the consciousness element. These,
friend, are the six elements rightly proclaimed by the Blessed One
who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened. How does the
venerable one know, how does he see, regarding these six elements, so
that through not clinging his mind is liberated from the taints?'</P>
<P  >8.
"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one with taints destroyed ... and is
completely liberated through final knowledge, this is the nature of
his answer:</P>
<P  >"'Friends,
I have treated the earth element as not self, with no self based on
the earth element.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1059anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1059sym"><SUP>mlix</SUP></A></SUP>
And with the destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, and
relinquishing of attraction and clinging based on the earth element,
of mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying tendencies based on
the earth element, I have understood that my mind is liberated.</P>
<P  >"'Friends,
I have treated the water element ... the fire element ... the air
element ... the space element ... the consciousness element as not
self, with no self based on the consciousness element. And with the
destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of

thus:</P>
<P  >"'But,

tangibles, the mind and mindobjects. These, friend, are the six
internal and external bases rightly proclaimed by the Blessed One who

"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one with taints destroyed ... and is
completely liberated through final knowledge, this is the nature of
his answer:</P>
<P  >"'Friends,
formerly when I lived the home life I was ignorant. Then the
Tathagata or his disciple taught me the Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma
I acquired faith in the Tathagata. Possessing that faith, I
considered thus: "Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone
forth is wide open. It is not easy while living in a home to lead the
holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I
shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth
from the home life into homelessness." On a later occasion,
abandoning a small or a large fortune, abandoning a small or a large
circle of relations, I shaved off my hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness.</P>
<P  >13-17.
"'Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus' training
and way of life ... (as Sutta 51, §§14-19) [34, 35] ... I purified
my mind from doubt. [36]</P>
<P  >18.
"'Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of
the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, I entered upon and abided in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. With the stilling of
applied and sustained thought, I entered upon and abided in the
second jhana ... With the fading away as well of rapture ... I
entered upon and abided in the third jhana ... With the abandoning of
pleasure and pain ... I entered upon and abided in the fourth jhana,
which has neither-painnor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity.</P>
<P  >19.
"'When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright,
unblemished, rid of imperfections, malleable, wieldy, steady, and
attained to imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the
destruction of the taints.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1062anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1062sym"><SUP>mlxii</SUP></A></SUP>
I directly knew as it actually is: "This is suffering" ... "This
is the origin of suffering 
This is the cessation of suffering" ...
"This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering." I
directly knew as it actually is: "These are the taints" ... "This
is the origin of the taints 
This is the cessation of the taints
This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints."</P>
<P  >20.
"'When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint
of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it was liberated there came the knowledge: "It is
liberated." I directly knew: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life
has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more
coming to any state of being."</P>
<P  >"'It
is by knowing thus, seeing thus, friends, that in regard to this body
with its consciousness and all external signs, I-making, mine-making,
and the underlying tendency to conceit have been eradicated in me.'</P>
<P  >21.
"Saying 'good,' bhikkhus, one may delight and rejoice in that
bhikkhu's words. Having done so, one should say to him: 'It is a
gain for us, friend, [37] it is a great gain for us, friend, that we
see such a companion in the holy life as the venerable one.'"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1063anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1063sym"><SUP>mlxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
