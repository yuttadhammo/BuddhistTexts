138. Uddesavibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of a Summary</H2>
<P  >[223]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There the Blessed
One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a summary and an exposition. Listen
and attend closely to what I shall say.” - “Yes, venerable sir,”
the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should examine things in such a way that while
he is examining them, his consciousness is not distracted and
scattered externally nor stuck internally, and by not clinging he
does not become agitated. If his consciousness is not distracted and
scattered externally nor stuck internally, and if by not clinging he
does not become agitated, then for him there is no origination of
suffering - of birth, ageing, and death in the future.”</P>
<P  >4.
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One
rose from his seat and went into his dwelling.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1249anc" HREF="#sdendnote1249sym"><SUP>mccxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the bhikkhus considered:
“Now, friends, the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone
into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding
the detailed meaning. Now who will expound this in detail?” Then
they considered: “The venerable Maha Kaccana is praised by the
Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life. He is
capable of expounding the detailed meaning. Suppose we went to him
and asked him the meaning of this.”</P>
<P  >6-8.
[224, 225] (As at Sutta 133, §§8-10.)</P>
<P  >9.
“Then listen, friends, and attend closely to what I shall say.”
“Yes, friend,” the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Maha</P>
<P  >Kaccana
said this:</P>
<P  >10.
“How, friends, is consciousness called ‘distracted and scattered
externally’?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1250anc" HREF="#sdendnote1250sym"><SUP>mccl</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, when a bhikkhu has seen a form with the eye, if his
consciousness follows after the sign of form, is tied and shackled by
gratification in the sign of form,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1251anc" HREF="#sdendnote1251sym"><SUP>mccli</SUP></A></SUP>
is fettered by the fetter of gratification in the sign of form, then
his consciousness is called ‘distracted and scattered externally.’</P>
<P  >“When
he has heard a sound with the ear … smelt an odour with the nose …
tasted a flavour with the tongue … touched a tangible with the body
… cognized a mind-object with the mind, if his consciousness
follows after the sign of the mind-object, is tied and shackled by
gratification in the sign of the mind-object, is fettered by the
fetter of gratification in the sign of the mindobject, then his
consciousness is called ‘distracted and scattered externally.’</P>
<P  >11.
“And how, friends, is consciousness called ‘not distracted and
scattered externally’? Here, when a bhikkhu has seen a form with
the eye, if his consciousness does not follow after the sign of form,
is not tied and shackled by gratification in the sign of form, is not
fettered by the fetter of gratification in the sign of form, then his
consciousness is called ‘not distracted and scattered externally.’

<P  >“When
he has heard a sound with the ear … smelt an odour with the nose …
tasted a flavour with the tongue … touched a tangible with the body
… cognized a mind-object with the mind, if his consciousness does
not follow after the sign of the mindobject, is not tied and shackled
by gratification in the sign of the mind-object, is not fettered by
the fetter of gratification in the sign of the mind-object, then his
consciousness is called ‘not distracted and scattered externally.’</P>
<P  >12.
“And how, friends, is the mind called ‘stuck internally’?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1252anc" HREF="#sdendnote1252sym"><SUP>mcclii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with
rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. If his consciousness follows
after the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, is tied and
shackled by gratification in the rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion, then his mind is called ‘stuck internally.’</P>
<P  >13.
“Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which</P>
<P  >has
self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. If his
consciousness follows after the rapture and pleasure born of
concentration … then his mind is called ‘stuck internally.’</P>
<P  >14.
“Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu abides
in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure
with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on
account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding
who has equanimity and is mindful.’ If his consciousness follows
after the equanimity … then his mind is called ‘stuck
internally.’</P>
<P  >15.
“Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the’ fourth jhana, which has neitherpain-nor-pleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. If his consciousness follows
after the neither-pain-nor-pleasure, is tied and shackled by
gratification in the neither-pain-norpleasure, is fettered by the
fetter of gratification in the neitherpain-nor-pleasure, then his
mind is called ‘stuck internally.’ That is how the mind is called
‘stuck internally.’ [227]</P>
<P  >16.
“And how, friends, is the mind called ‘not stuck internally’?
Here, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana … If his consciousness does not follow after the rapture and
pleasure born of seclusion, is not tied and shackled by gratification
in the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, is not fettered by the
fetter of gratification in the rapture and pleasure born of
seclusion, then his mind is called ‘not stuck internally.’</P>
<P  >17.
“Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana … If his
consciousness does not follow after the rapture and pleasure born of
concentration … then his mind is called ‘not stuck internally.’</P>
<P  >18.
“Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu …
enters upon and abides in the third jhana … If his consciousness
does not follow after the equanimity … then his mind is called ‘not
stuck internally.’</P>
<P  >19.
“Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain … a bhikkhu
enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana … If his consciousness
does not follow after the neither-pain-nor-pleasure, is not tied and
shackled by gratification in the neither-pain-norpleasure, is not
fettered by the fetter of gratification in the
neitherpain-nor-pleasure, then his mind is called ‘not stuck
internally.’ That is how the mind is called ‘not stuck
internally.’</P>
<P  >20.
“How, friends, is there agitation due to clinging?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1253anc" HREF="#sdendnote1253sym"><SUP>mccliii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and
is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no regard for
true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards
material form as self, or self as possessed of material form, or
material form as in self, or self as in material form. That material
form of his changes and becomes otherwise. With the change and
becoming otherwise of that material form, his consciousness is
preoccupied with the change of material form. Agitated mental states
born of preoccupation with the change of material form arise
together<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1254anc" HREF="#sdendnote1254sym"><SUP>mccliv</SUP></A></SUP>
and remain obsessing his mind. Because his mind is obsessed, he is
anxious, distressed, and concerned, and due to clinging he becomes
agitated.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1255anc" HREF="#sdendnote1255sym"><SUP>mcclv</SUP></A></SUP>
[228]</P>
<P  >“He
regards feeling as self … He regards perception as self … He
regards formations as self … He regards consciousness as self, or
self as possessed of consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or
self as in consciousness. That consciousness of his changes and
becomes otherwise. With the change and becoming otherwise of that
consciousness, his consciousness is preoccupied with the change of
consciousness. Agitated states of mind born of preoccupation with the
change of consciousness arise together and remain obsessing his mind.
Because his mind is obsessed, he is anxious, distressed, and
concerned, and due to clinging he becomes agitated. That is how there
is agitation due to clinging.</P>
<P  >21.
“And how, friends, is there non-agitation due to non-clinging?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1256anc" HREF="#sdendnote1256sym"><SUP>mcclvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Here a well-taught noble disciple who has regard for noble ones and
is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for true
men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not regard
material form as self, or self as possessed of material form, or
material form as in self, or self as in material form. That material
form of his changes and becomes otherwise. With the change and
becoming otherwise of that material form, his consciousness is not
preoccupied with the change of material form. Agitated mental states
born of preoccupation with the change of material form do not arise
together and remain obsessing his mind. Because his mind is not
obsessed, he is not anxious, distressed, and concerned, and due to
non-clinging he does not become agitated.</P>
<P  >“He
does not regard feeling as self … He does not regard perception as
self … He does not regard formations as self … He does not regard
consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or
consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That
consciousness of his changes and becomes otherwise. With the change
and becoming otherwise of that consciousness, his consciousness is
not preoccupied with the change of consciousness. Agitated mental
states born of preoccupation with the change of consciousness do not
arise together and remain obsessing his mind. Because his mind is not
obsessed, he is not anxious, distressed, and concerned, and due to
non-clinging he does not become agitated. That is how there is
non-agitation due to non-clinging.</P>
<P  >22.
“Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his
dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the
detailed meaning, that is: ‘Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu should examine
things in such a way that while he is examining them, his
consciousness is not distracted and scattered externally nor stuck
internally, and by not clinging he does not become agitated. If his
consciousness is not distracted and scattered externally nor stuck
internally, and if by not clinging he does not become agitated, then
for him there is no origination of suffering - of birth, ageing, and
death in the future,’ I understand the detailed meaning of this
summary to be thus. [229] Now, friends, if you wish, go to the
Blessed One and ask him about the meaning of this. As the Blessed One
explains it to you, so you should remember it.”</P>
<P  >23.
Then the bhikkhus, having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable
Maha Kaccana’s words, rose from their seats and went to the Blessed
One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told
the Blessed One all that had taken place after he had left, adding:
“Then, venerable sir, we went to the venerable Maha Kaccana and
asked him about the meaning. The venerable Maha Kaccana expounded the
meaning to us with these terms, statements, and phrases.”</P>
<P  >24.
“Maha Kaccana is wise, bhikkhus, Maha Kaccana has great wisdom. If
you had asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to
you in the same way that Maha Kaccana has explained it. Such is its
meaning, and so you should remember it.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
