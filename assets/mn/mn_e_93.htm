93. Assalayana Sutta - To Assalayana</H2>
<P  >[147]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Now at that time five hundred brahmins from diverse provinces were
staying at Savatthi for some business or other. Then those brahmins
thought: "This recluse Gotama describes purification for all the
four castes.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote869anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote869sym"><SUP>dccclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Who is there able to dispute with him about this assertion?"</P>
<P  >3.
Now on that occasion a brahmin student named Assalayana was staying
at Savatthi. Young, shaven-headed, sixteen years old, he was a master
of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and
etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and
grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks
of a Great Man. Then the brahmins thought: "There is this young
brahmin student named Assalayana staying at Savatthi. Young ... fully
versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. He will
be able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion."</P>
<P  >4.
So the brahmins went to the brahmin student Assalayana and said to
him: "Master Assalayana, this recluse Gotama describes purification
for all the four castes. Let Master Assalayana come and dispute with
the recluse Gotama about this assertion."</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana replied: "Sirs, the
recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the
Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with
the recluse Gotama about this assertion."</P>
<P  >A
second time the brahmins said to him: "Master Assalayana, this
recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Let
Master Assalayana come [148] and dispute with the recluse Gotama
about this assertion. For the training of a wanderer has been
completed by Master Assalayana."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote870anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote870sym"><SUP>dccclxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >For
the second time the brahmin student Assalayana replied: "Sirs, the
recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the
Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with
the recluse Gotama about this assertion."</P>
<P  >A
third time the brahmins said to him: "Master Assalayana, this
recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Let
Master Assalayana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this
assertion. For the training of a wanderer has been completed by
Master Assalayana. Let not the Master Assalayana be defeated without
having even fought the battle."</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana replied: "Sirs, the
recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the
Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with
the recluse Gotama about this assertion. Still, sirs, at your bidding
I will go."</P>
<P  >5.
Then the brahmin student Assalayana went with a large number of
brahmin to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When
this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side
and said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, the brahmins say thus:
'Brahmins are the highest caste, those of any other caste are
inferior; brahmins are the fairest caste, those of any other caste
are dark; only brahmins are purified, not non-brahmins; brahmins
alone are the sons of Brahma, the offspring of Brahma, born of his
mouth, born of Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of Brahma.' What
does Master Gotama say about that?"</P>
<P  >"Now,
Assalayana, the brahmin women are seen having their periods, becoming
pregnant, giving birth, and giving suck.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote871anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote871sym"><SUP>dccclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
And yet those who are born from the wombs of the brahmin women say
thus: 'Brahmins are the highest caste ... brahmins alone are the
sons of Brahma, the offspring of Brahma, born of his mouth, born of
Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of Brahma.'"[149]</P>
<P  >6.
"Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus:
'Brahmins are the highest caste ... heirs of Brahma.'"</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Assalayana? Have you heard that in Yona and Kamboja<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote872anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote872sym"><SUP>dccclxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
and in other outland countries there are</P>
<P  >only
two castes, masters and slaves, and that masters become slaves and
slaves masters?"</P>
<P  >"So
I have heard, sir."</P>
<P  >"Then
on the strength of what [argument] or with the support of what
[authority] do the brahmins in this case say thus: 'Brahmins are
the highest caste ... heirs of Brahma'?"</P>
<P  >7.
"Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus:
'Brahmins are the highest caste ... heirs of Brahma.'"</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Assalayana?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote873anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote873sym"><SUP>dccclxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
Suppose a noble were to kill living beings, take what is not given,
misconduct himself in sensual pleasures, speak falsely, speak
maliciously, speak harshly, gossip, be covetous, have a mind of ill
will, and hold wrong view. On the dissolution of the body, after
death, would only he [be likely to] reappear in a state of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell -
and not a brahmin? Suppose a merchant ... a worker were to kill
living beings ... and hold wrong view. On the dissolution of the body
after death, would only he [be likely to] reappear in a state of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell -
and not a brahmin?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Whether it be a noble, or a brahmin, or a merchant, or
a worker - those of all four castes who kill living beings [150] ...
and hold wrong view, on the dissolution of the body, after death,
[are likely to] reappear in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy
destination, in perdition, even in hell."</P>
<P  >"Then
on the strength of what [argument] or with the support of what
[authority] do the brahmins in this case say thus: 'Brahmins are
the highest caste ... heirs of Brahma'?"</P>
<P  >8.
"Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus:
'Brahmins are the highest caste ... heirs of Brahma.'"</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Assalayana? Suppose a brahmin were to abstain from
killing living beings, from taking what is not given, from misconduct
in sensual pleasures, from false speech, from malicious speech, from
harsh speech, and from gossip, and were to be uncovetous, to have a
mind without ill will, and to hold right view. On the dissolution of
the body, after death, would only he [be likely to] reappear in a
happy destination, even in the heavenly world - and not a noble, or a
merchant, or a worker?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Whether it be a noble, or a brahmin, or a merchant, or
a worker - those of all four castes who abstain</P>
<P  >from
killing living beings ... and hold right view, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, [are likely to] reappear in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world."</P>
<P  >"Then
on the strength of what [argument] or with the support of what
[authority] do the brahmins in this case say thus: 'Brahmins are

<P  >9.
"Although Master Gotama says this, [151] still the brahmins think
thus: 'Brahmins are the highest caste ... heirs of Brahma.'"</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Assalayana? Is only a brahmin capable of developing a
mind of loving-kindness towards a certain region, without hostility
and without ill will, and not a noble, or a merchant, or a worker?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Whether it be a noble, or a brahmin, or a merchant, or
a worker - those of all four castes are capable of developing a mind
of loving-kindness towards a certain region, without hostility and
without ill will."</P>
<P  >"Then
on the strength of what [argument] or with the support of what
[authority] do the brahmins in this case say thus: 'Brahmins are

<P  >10.
"Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus:
'Brahmins are the highest caste ... heirs of Brahma.'"</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Assalayana? Is only a brahmin capable of taking a
loofah and bath powder, going to the river, and washing off dust and
dirt, and not a noble, or a merchant, or a worker?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. Whether it be a noble, or a brahmin, or a merchant, or
a worker - those of all four castes are capable of taking a loofah
and bath powder, going to the river, and washing off dust and dirt."</P>
<P  >"Then

<P  >11.
"Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus:
'Brahmins are the highest caste ... heirs of Brahma.'"</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Assalayana? [152] Suppose a headanointed noble king
were to assemble here a hundred men of different birth and say to
them: 'Come, sirs, let any here who have been born into a noble
clan or a brahmin clan or a royal clan take an upper fire-stick of
sala wood, salala wood, sandalwood, or padumaka wood and light a fire
and produce heat. And also let any who have been born into an outcast
clan, a trapper clan, a wicker workers' clan, a cartwrights'
clan, or a scavengers' clan take an upper fire-stick made from a
dog's drinking trough, from a pig's trough, from a dustbin, or
from castor-oil wood and light a fire and produce heat.'</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Assalayana? When a fire is lit and heat is produced by
someone in the first group, would that fire have a flame, a colour,
and a radiance, and would it be possible to use it for the purposes
of fire, while when a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone of
the second group, that fire would have no flame, no colour, and no
radiance, and it would not be possible to use it for the purposes of
fire?"</P>
<P  >"No,
Master Gotama. When a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone in
the first group, that fire would have a flame, a colour, and a
radiance, and it would be possible to use it for the purposes of
fire. And when a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone of the
second group, that fire too would have a flame, a colour, and a
radiance, and it would be possible to use it for the purposes of
fire. For all fire has a flame, [153] a colour, and a radiance, and
it is possible to use all fire for the purposes of fire."</P>
<P  >"Then
on the strength of what [argument] or with the support of what
[authority] do the brahmins in this case say thus: 'Brahmins are

<P  >12.
"Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus:
'Brahmins are the highest caste ... heirs of Brahma.'"</P>
<P  >"What
do you think, Assalayana? Suppose a noble youth were to cohabit with
a brahmin girl, and a son was born from their cohabitation. Should a
son born from a noble youth and a brahmin girl be called a noble
after the father or a brahmin after the mother?"</P>
<P  >"He
could be called both, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >13.
"What do you think, Assalayana? Suppose a brahmin youth here were
to cohabit with a noble girl, and a son were to be born from their
cohabitation. Should the son born from a brahmin youth and a noble
girl be called a noble after the mother or a brahmin after the
father?"</P>
<P  >"He
could be called both, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >14.
"What do you think, Assalayana? Suppose a mare were to be mated
with a male donkey, and a foal were to be born as the result. Should
the foal be called a horse after the mother or a donkey after the
father?"</P>
<P  >"It
is a mule, Master Gotama, since it does not belong to either kind.
[154] I see the difference in this last case, but I see no difference
in either of the former cases."</P>
<P  >15.
"What do you think, Assalayana? Suppose there were two brahmin
students who were brothers, born of the same mother, one studious and
acute, and one neither studious nor acute. Which of them would
brahmins feed first at a funeral feast, or at a ceremonial milk-rice
offering, or at a sacrificial feast, or at a feast for guests?"</P>
<P  >"On
such occasions, brahmins would feed first the one who was studious
and acute, Master Gotama; for how could what is given to one who is
neither studious nor acute bring great fruit?"</P>
<P  >16.
"What do you think, Assalayana? Suppose there were two brahmin
students who were brothers, born of the same mother, one studious and
acute, but immoral and of bad character, and one neither studious nor
acute, but virtuous and of good character. Which of them would
brahmins feed first at a funeral feast, or at a ceremonial milk-rice
offering, or at a sacrificial feast, or at a feast for guests?"</P>
<P  >"On
such occasions, brahmins would feed first the one who was neither
studious nor acute, but virtuous and of good character, Master
Gotama; for how could what is given to one who is immoral and of bad
character bring great fruit?"</P>
<P  >17.
"First, Assalayana, you took your stand on birth, and after that
you took your stand on scriptural learning, and after that you have
come to take your stand on the very ground that purification is for
all four castes, as I describe it."</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana sat silent and
dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and without
response. Knowing this, the Blessed One said to him:</P>
<P  >18.
"Once, Assalayana, when seven brahmin seers were dwelling in leaf
huts in the forest, this pernicious view arose in them: 'Brahmins
are the highest caste ... [155] ... heirs of Brahma.' Now the seer
Devala the Dark heard this.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote874anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote874sym"><SUP>dccclxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Then he arranged his hair and beard, dressed in ochre-coloured
garments, put on stout sandals, and taking a staff made of gold, he
appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers. Then, while
walking up and down the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers, the
seer Devala the Dark spoke thus: 'Where have those worthy Brahmin
seers gone? Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone?' Then the
seven brahmin seers thought: 'Who is walking up and down in the
courtyard of the seven brahmin seers like a village lout speaking
thus: "Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone? Where have those
worthy brahmin seers gone?" Let us curse him!' Then the seven
brahmin seers cursed the seer Devala the Dark thus: 'Be ashes, vile
one! Be ashes, vile one!' But the more the seven brahmin seers
cursed him, the more comely, beautiful, and handsome the seer Devala
the Dark became. Then the seven brahmin seers thought: 'Our
asceticism is in vain, our holy life is fruitless; for formerly when
we cursed anyone thus: "Be ashes, vile one! Be ashes, vile one!"
he always became ashes; but the more we curse this one, the more
comely, beautiful, and handsome he becomes.'</P>
<P  >"'Your
asceticism is not in vain, sirs, your holy life is not fruitless.
But, sirs, put away your hatred towards me.' [156]</P>
<P  >"'We
have put away our hatred towards you, sir. Who are you?'</P>
<P  >"'Have
you heard of the seer Devala the Dark, sirs?' - 'Yes, sir.' -'I
am he, sirs.'</P>
<P  >"Then
the seven brahmin seers went to the seer Devala the Dark and paid
homage to him. Then he said to them: 'Sirs, I heard that while the
seven brahmin seers were dwelling in leaf huts in the forest, this
pernicious view arose in them: "Brahmins are the highest caste ...
heirs of Brahma.'"-'That is so, sir.'</P>
<P  >But,
sirs, do you know if the mother who bore you went only with a brahmin
and never with a non-brahmin?' -'No, sir.'</P>
<P  >"'But,
sirs, do you know if your mother's mothers back to the seventh
generation went only with brahmins and never with non-brahmin?'
-'No, sir.'</P>
<P  >"'But,
sirs, do you know if the father who begot you went only with a
brahmin woman and never with a non-brahmin woman?' -'No, sir.'</P>
<P  >"'But,
sirs, do you know if your father's fathers back to the seventh
generation went only with brahmin women and never with non-brahmin
women?'-'No, sir.'</P>
<P  >"'But,
sirs, do you know how the conception of an embryo in a womb comes
about?'</P>
<P  >"'Sir,
we know how the conception of an embryo in a womb comes about. [157]
Here, there is a union of the mother and father, and it is the
mother's season, and the being to be reborn is present. Thus the
conception of an embryo in a womb comes about through the union of
these three things.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote875anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote875sym"><SUP>dccclxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"'Then,
sirs, do you know for sure whether that being to be reborn is a
noble, or a brahmin, or a merchant, or a worker?'</P>
<P  >"'Sir,
we do not know for sure whether that being to be reborn is a. noble,
or a brahmin, or a merchant, or a worker.'</P>
<P  >"'That
being so, sirs, then what are you?'</P>
<P  >"'That
being so, sir, we do not know what we are.'</P>
<P  >"Now,
Assalayana, even those seven brahmin seers, on being pressed and
questioned and cross-questioned by the seer Devala the Dark on their
own assertion about birth, were unable to support it. But how shall
you, on being pressed and questioned and cross-questioned by me now
on your assertion about birth, be able to support it? You, who rely
on the teachers' doctrines, are not [even fit to be] their
spoon-holder Punna."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote876anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote876sym"><SUP>dccclxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >19.
When this was said, the brahmin student Assalayana said to the
Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master
Gotama! ... (as Sutta 91, §37) ... From today let Master Gotama
remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for
life."</P>
