111. Anupada Sutta - One by One As They Occurred</H2>
<P  >[2511.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable, sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, Sariputta is wise; Sariputta has great wisdom; Sariputta
has wide wisdom; Sariputta has joyous wisdom; Sariputta has quick
wisdom; Sariputta has keen wisdom; Sariputta has penetrative wisdom.
During half a month, bhikkhus, Sariputta had insight into states one
by one as they occurred.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1046anc" HREF="#sdendnote1046sym"><SUP>mxlvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Now Sariputta's insight into states one by one as they occurred was
this:</P>
<P  >3.
"Here, bhikkhus, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unwholesome states, Sariputta entered upon and abided in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</P>
<P  >4.
"And the states in the first jhana - the applied thought, the
sustained thought, the rapture, the pleasure, and the unification of
mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal,
decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention - these
states were defined by him one by one as they occurred;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1047anc" HREF="#sdendnote1047sym"><SUP>mxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
known to him those states arose, known they were present, known they
disappeared. He understood thus: 'So indeed, these states, not
having been, come into being; having been, they vanish.' Regarding
those states, he abided unattracted, unrepelled, independent,
detached, free, dissociated, with a mind rid of barriers.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1048anc" HREF="#sdendnote1048sym"><SUP>mxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
He understood: 'There is an escape beyond,' and with the
cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed that there is.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1049anc" HREF="#sdendnote1049sym"><SUP>mxlix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
"Again, bhikkhus, with the stilling of applied and sustained
thought, Sariputta entered and abided in [26] the second jhana, which
has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and
sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.</P>
<P  >6.
"And the states in the second jhana - the self-confidence, the
rapture, the pleasure, and the unification of mind; the contact,
feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy,
mindfulness, equanimity, and attention - these states were defined by
him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose,
known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus:
… and with the cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed that
there is.</P>
<P  >7.
"Again, bhikkhus, with the fading away as well of rapture,
Sariputta abided in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still
feeling pleasure with the body, he entered upon and abided in the
third jhana, on account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a
pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.'</P>
<P  >8.
"And the states in the third jhana - the equanimity, the pleasure,
the mindfulness, the full awareness, and the unification of mind; the
contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision,
energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention - these states were
defined by him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states
arose, known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood
thus: … and with the cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed
that there is.</P>
<P  >9.
"Again, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and
with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, Sariputta entered
upon and abided in the fourth jhana, which has
neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to
equanimity.</P>
<P  >10.
"And the states in the fourth jhana - the equanimity, the
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, the mental unconcern due to
tranquillity,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1050anc" HREF="#sdendnote1050sym"><SUP>ml</SUP></A></SUP>
the purity of mindfulness, and the unification of mind; the contact,
feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy,
mindfulness, equanimity, and attention - these states were defined by
him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose,
known they were present, [27] known they disappeared. He understood
thus: … and with the cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed
that there is.</P>
<P  >11.
"Again, bhikkhus, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of
form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is
infinite,' Sariputta entered upon and abided in the base of
infinite space.</P>
<P  >12.
"And the states in the base of infinite space - the perception of
the base of infinite space and the unification of mind; the contact,
feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy,
mindfulness, equanimity, and attention - these states were defined by
him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose,
known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus:
… and with the cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed that
there is.</P>
<P  >13.
"Again, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite,' Sariputta entered
upon and abided in the base of infinite consciousness.</P>
<P  >14.
"And the states in the base of infinite consciousness - the
perception of the base of infinite consciousness and the unification
of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the
zeal, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention -
these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred; known
to him those states arose, known they were present, known they
disappeared. He understood thus: … and with the cultivation of that
[attainment], he confirmed that there is. [28]</P>
<P  >15.
"Again, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing,' Sariputta entered
upon and abided in the base of nothingness.</P>
<P  >16.
"And the states in the base of nothingness - the perception of the
base of nothingness and the unification of mind; the contact,
feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy,
mindfulness, equanimity, and attention - these states were defined by
him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose,
known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus:
… and with the cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed that
there is.</P>
<P  >17.
"Again, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of
nothingness, Sariputta entered upon and abided in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</P>
<P  >18.
"He emerged mindful from that attainment. Having done so, he
contemplated the past states, which had ceased and changed, thus: 'So
indeed, these states, not having been, come into being; having been,
they vanish.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1051anc" HREF="#sdendnote1051sym"><SUP>mli</SUP></A></SUP>
Regarding those states, he abided unattracted, unrepelled,
independent, detached, free, dissociated, with a mind rid of
barriers. He understood: 'There is an escape beyond,' and with
the cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed that there is.</P>
<P  >19.
"Again, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, Sariputta entered upon and
abided in the cessation of perception and feeling. And his taints
were destroyed by his seeing with wisdom.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1052anc" HREF="#sdendnote1052sym"><SUP>mlii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >20.
"He emerged mindful from that attainment. Having done so, he
recalled the past states, which had ceased and changed, thus: 'So
indeed, these states, not having been, come into being; having been,
they vanish.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1053anc" HREF="#sdendnote1053sym"><SUP>mliii</SUP></A></SUP>
Regarding those states, he abided unattracted, unrepelled,
independent, detached, free, dissociated, with a mind rid of
barriers. He understood: 'There is no escape beyond,' and with
the cultivation of that [attainment], he confirmed that there is
not.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1054anc" HREF="#sdendnote1054sym"><SUP>mliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >21.
"Bhikkhus, rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone: 'He
has attained mastery and perfection<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1055anc" HREF="#sdendnote1055sym"><SUP>mlv</SUP></A></SUP>
in noble virtue, [29] attained mastery and perfection in noble
concentration, attained mastery and perfection in noble wisdom,
attained mastery and perfection in noble deliverance,' it is of
Sariputta indeed that rightly speaking this should be said.</P>
<P  >22.
"Bhikkhus, rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone: 'He is
the son of the Blessed One, born of his breast, born of his mouth,
born of the Dhamma, created by the Dhamma, an heir in the Dhamma, not
an heir in material things,' it is of Sariputta indeed that rightly
speaking this should be said.</P>
<P  >23.
"Bhikkhus, the matchless Wheel of the Dhamma set rolling by the
Tathagata is kept rolling rightly by Sariputta."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
