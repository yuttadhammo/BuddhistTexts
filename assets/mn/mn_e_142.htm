142. Dakkhinavibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of Offerings</H2>
<P  >[253]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Mahapajapati Gotami took a new pair of cloths and went to the
Blessed One.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1291anc" HREF="#sdendnote1291sym"><SUP>mccxci</SUP></A></SUP>
After paying homage to him, she sat down at one side and said to the
Blessed One: “Venerable sir, this new pair of cloths has been spun
by me, woven by me, especially for the Blessed One. Venerable sir,
let the Blessed One accept it from me out of compassion.”</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the Blessed One told her: “Give it to the Sangha,
Gotami. When you give it to the Sangha, the offering will be made
both to me and to the Sangha.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1292anc" HREF="#sdendnote1292sym"><SUP>mccxcii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >A
second time and a third time she said to the Blessed One: “Venerable
sir, … accept it from me out of compassion.”</P>
<P  >A
second time and a third time the Blessed One told her: “Give it to
the Sangha, Gotami. When you give it to the Sangha, the offering will
be made both to me and to the Sangha.”</P>
<P  >3.
Then the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir,
let the Blessed One accept the new pair of cloths from Mahapajapati
Gotami. Mahapajapati Gotami has been very helpful to the Blessed One,
venerable sir. As his mother’s sister, she was his nurse, his
foster mother, the one who gave him milk. She suckled the Blessed One
when his own mother died. The Blessed One too has been very helpful
to Mahapajapati Gotami, venerable sir. It is owing to the Blessed One
that Mahapajapati Gotami has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the
Dhamma, and the Sangha. It is owing to the Blessed One that
Mahapajapati Gotami abstains from killing living beings, from taking
what is not given, from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from false
speech, and from wine, liquor, and intoxicants, which are the basis
of negligence. It is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati
Gotami possesses perfect confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and
the Sangha, and that she possesses [254] the virtues loved by noble
ones.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1293anc" HREF="#sdendnote1293sym"><SUP>mccxciii</SUP></A></SUP>
It is owing to the Blessed One that Mahapajapati Gotami is free from
doubt about suffering, about the origin of suffering, about the
cessation of suffering, and about the way leading to the cessation of
suffering. The Blessed One has been very helpful to Mahapajapati
Gotami.”</P>
<P  >4.
“That is so, Ananda, that is so! When one person, owing to another,
has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, I say
that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying
homage to him, rising up for him, according him reverential
salutation and polite services, and by providing robes, almsfood,
resting places, and medicinal requisites.</P>
<P  >“When
one person, owing to another, has come to abstain from killing living
beings, from taking what is not given, from misconduct in sensual
pleasures, from false speech, and from wine, liquor, and intoxicants,
which are the basis of negligence, I say that it is not easy for the
former to repay the latter by paying homage to him … and medicinal
requisites.</P>
<P  >“When
one person, owing to another, has come to possess perfect confidence
in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and to possess the virtues
loved by noble ones, I say that it is not easy for the former to
repay the latter by paying homage to him … and medicinal
requisites.</P>
<P  >“When
one person, owing to another, has become free from doubt about
suffering, about the origin of suffering, about the cessation of
suffering, and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering, I
say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying
homage to him … and medicinal requisites.</P>
<P  >5.
“There are fourteen kinds of personal offerings, Ananda.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1294anc" HREF="#sdendnote1294sym"><SUP>mccxciv</SUP></A></SUP>
One gives a gift to the Tathagata, accomplished and fully
enlightened; this is the first kind of personal offering. One gives a
gift to a paccekabuddha; this is the second kind of personal
offering. One gives a gift to an arahant disciple of the Tathagata;
this is the third kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to one
who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of
arahantship; this is the fourth kind of personal offering. One gives
a gift to a non-returner; this is the fifth kind of personal
offering. [255] One gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way
to the realisation of the fruit of non-return; this is the sixth kind
of personal offering. One gives a gift to a once-returner; this is
the seventh kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to one who
has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of
once-return; this is the eighth kind of personal offering. One gives
a gift to a stream-enterer; this is the ninth kind of personal
offering. One gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the
realisation of the fruit of stream-entry;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1295anc" HREF="#sdendnote1295sym"><SUP>mccxcv</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the tenth kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to one
outside [the Dispensation] who is free from lust for sensual
pleasures;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1296anc" HREF="#sdendnote1296sym"><SUP>mccxcvi</SUP></A></SUP>
this is the eleventh kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to a
virtuous ordinary person; this is the twelfth kind of personal
offering. One gives a gift to an immoral ordinary person; this is the
thirteenth kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to an animal;
this is the fourteenth kind of personal offering.</P>
<P  >6.
“Herein, Ananda, by giving a gift to an animal, the offering may be
expected to repay a hundredfold.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1297anc" HREF="#sdendnote1297sym"><SUP>mccxcvii</SUP></A></SUP>
By giving a gift to an immoral ordinary person, the offering may be
expected to repay a thousandfold. By giving a gift to a virtuous
ordinary person, the offering may be expected to repay a
hundred-thousandfold. By giving a gift to one outside [the
Dispensation] who is free from lust for sensual pleasures, the
offering may be expected to repay a hundred-thousand times a
hundred-thousandfold.</P>
<P  >“By
giving a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realisation
of the fruit of stream-entry, the offering may be expected to repay
incalculably, immeasurably. What, then, should be said about giving a
gift to a stream-enterer? What should be said about giving a gift to
one who has entered upon the way to the realisation of the fruit of
once-return … to a once-returner … to one who has entered upon
the way to the realisation of the fruit of non-return … to a
non-returner … to one who has entered upon the way to the
realisation of the fruit of arahantship … to an arahant … to a
paccekabuddha? What should be said about giving a gift to a
Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1298anc" HREF="#sdendnote1298sym"><SUP>mccxcviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >7.
“There are seven kinds of offerings made to the Sangha, Ananda. One
gives a gift to a Sangha of both [bhikkhus and bhikkhunis] headed by
the Buddha; this is the first kind of offering made to the Sangha.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1299anc" HREF="#sdendnote1299sym"><SUP>mccxcix</SUP></A></SUP>
One gives a gift to a Sangha of both [bhikkhus and bhikkhunis] after
the Tathagata has attained final Nibbana; this is the second kind of
offering made to the Sangha.</P>
<P  >One
gives a gift to a Sangha of bhikkhus; this is the third kind of
offering made to the Sangha. One gives a gift to a Sangha of
bhikkhunis; this is the fourth kind of offering made to the Sangha.
One gives a gift, saying: ‘Appoint so many bhikkhus and bhikkhunis
for me from the Sangha’; [256] this is the fifth kind of offering
made to the Sangha. One gives a gift, saying: ‘Appoint so many
bhikkhus for me from the Sangha’; this is the sixth kind of
offering made to the Sangha. One gives a gift, saying: ‘Appoint so
many bhikkhunis for me from the Sangha’; this is the seventh kind
of offering made to the Sangha.</P>
<P  >8.
“In future times, Ananda, there will be members of the clan who are
‘yellow-necks,’ immoral, of evil character.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1300anc" HREF="#sdendnote1300sym"><SUP>mccc</SUP></A></SUP>
People will give gifts to those immoral persons for the sake of the
Sangha. Even then, I say, an offering made to the Sangha is
incalculable, immeasurable.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1301anc" HREF="#sdendnote1301sym"><SUP>mccci</SUP></A></SUP>
And I say that in no way does a gift to a person individually ever
have greater fruit than an offering made to the Sangha.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1302anc" HREF="#sdendnote1302sym"><SUP>mcccii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9.
“There are four kinds of purification of offering. What four? There
is the offering that is purified by the giver, not by the receiver.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1303anc" HREF="#sdendnote1303sym"><SUP>mccciii</SUP></A></SUP>
There is the offering that is purified by the receiver, not by the
giver. There is the offering that is purified neither by the giver
nor by the receiver. There is the offering that is purified both by
the giver and by the receiver.</P>
<P  >10.
“And what is the offering that is purified by the giver, not by the
receiver? Here the giver is virtuous, of good character, and the
receiver is immoral, of evil character. Thus the offering is purified
by the giver, not by the receiver.</P>
<P  >11.
“And what is the offering that is purified by the receiver, not by
the giver? Here the giver is immoral, of evil character, and the
receiver is virtuous, of good character. Thus the offering is
purified by the receiver, not by the giver.</P>
<P  >12.
“And what is the offering that is purified neither by the giver nor
by the receiver? Here the giver is immoral, of evil character, and
the receiver is immoral, of evil character. Thus the offering is
purified neither by the giver nor by the receiver.</P>
<P  >13.
“And what is the offering that is purified both by the giver and by
the receiver? Here the giver is virtuous, of good character, and the
receiver is virtuous, of good character. [257] Thus the offering is
purified both by the giver and by the receiver. These are the four
kinds of purification of offering.”</P>
<P  >14.
That is what the Blessed One said. When the Sublime One had said
that, the Teacher said further:</P>
<P >
“When a virtuous person to an immoral person gives</P>
<P >
With trusting heart a gift righteously obtained,</P>
<P >
Placing faith that the fruit of action is great,</P>
<P >
The giver’s virtue purifies the offering.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
When an immoral person to a virtuous person gives</P>
<P >
With untrusting heart a gift unrighteously obtained,</P>
<P >
Nor places faith that the fruit of action is great,</P>
<P >
The receiver’s virtue purifies the offering.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
When an immoral person to an immoral person gives</P>
<P >
With untrusting heart a gift unrighteously obtained,</P>
<P >
Nor places faith that the fruit of action is great,</P>
<P >
Neither’s virtue purifies the offering.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
When a virtuous person to a virtuous person gives</P>
<P >
With trusting heart a gift righteously obtained,</P>
<P >
Placing faith that the fruit of action is great,</P>
<P >
That gift, I say, will come to full fruition.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
When a passionless person to a passionless person gives</P>
<P >
With trusting heart a gift righteously obtained,</P>
<P >
Placing faith that the fruit of action is great,</P>
<P >
That gift, I say, is the best of worldly gifts.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1304anc" HREF="#sdendnote1304sym"><SUP>mccciv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
