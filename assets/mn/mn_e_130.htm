130. Devaduta Sutta - The Divine Messengers</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, suppose there were two houses with doors and a man with
good sight standing there between them saw people going in and coming
out and passing to and fro. So too, with the divine eye, which is
purified and surpasses the human, I see beings passing away and
reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and
unfortunate. I understand how beings pass on according to their
actions thus: ‘These worthy beings who were well-conducted in body,
speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views,
giving effect to right views in their actions, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, have reappeared in a happy destination, even
in the heavenly world. Or these worthy beings who were well-conducted
in body, speech, and mind, not [179] revilers of noble ones, right in
their views, giving effect to right views in their actions, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared among human
beings. But these worthy beings who were ill-conducted in body,
speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views,
giving effect to wrong views in their actions, on the dissolution of
the body, after death, have reappeared in the realm of ghosts. Or
these worthy beings who were ill-conducted … on the dissolution of
the body, after death, have reappeared in the animal world. Or these
worthy beings who were illconducted.. .on the dissolution of the
body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in an
unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.’</P>
<P  >3.
“Now the wardens of hell seize such a being by the arms and present
him to King Yama,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1206anc" HREF="#sdendnote1206sym"><SUP>mccvi</SUP></A></SUP>
saying: ‘Sire, this man has illtreated his mother, ill-treated his
father, ill-treated recluses, illtreated brahmins; he has had no
respect for the elders of his clan. Let the king order his
punishment.’</P>
<P  >4.
“Then King Yama presses and questions and cross-questions him about
the first divine messenger: ‘Good man, did you not see the first
divine messenger to appear in the world?’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1207anc" HREF="#sdendnote1207sym"><SUP>mccvii</SUP></A></SUP>
He says: ‘I did not, venerable sir.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good
man, have you never seen in the world a young tender infant lying
prone, fouled in his own excrement and urine?’ He says: ‘I have,
venerable sir.’</P>
<P  >“Then
King Yama says: ‘Good man, did it never occur to you - an
intelligent and mature man - “I too am subject to birth, I am not
exempt from birth: surely I had better do good by body, speech, and
mind”?’ He says: ‘I was unable, venerable sir, I was
negligent.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good man, through negligence
you have failed to do good by body, speech, and mind. Certainly they
will deal with you according to your negligence. But this evil action
of yours was not done by your mother or your father, [180] or by your
brother or your sister, or by your friends and companions, or by your
kinsmen and relatives, or by recluses and brahmins, or by gods: this
evil action was done by you yourself, and you yourself will
experience its result.’</P>
<P  >5.
“Then, after pressing and questioning and cross-questioning him
about the first divine messenger, King Yama presses and questions and
cross-questions him about the second divine messenger: ‘Good man,
did you not see the second divine messenger to appear in the world?’
He says: ‘I did not, venerable sir.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good
man, have you never seen in the world a man - or a woman - at eighty,
ninety, or a hundred years, aged, as crooked as a roof bracket,
doubled up, supported by a walking stick, tottering, frail, youth
gone, teeth broken, grey-haired, scanty-haired, bald, wrinkled, with
limbs all blotchy?’ He says: ‘I have, venerable sir.’</P>
<P  >“Then
King Yama says: ‘Good man, did it never occur to you - an
intelligent and mature man - “I too am subject to ageing, I am not
exempt from ageing: surely I had better do good by body, speech, and
mind”?’ He says: ‘I was unable, venerable sir, I was
negligent.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good man, through negligence
you have failed to do good by body, speech, and mind. Certainly they
will deal with you according to your negligence. But this evil action
of yours was not done by your mother … or by gods: this evil action
was done by you yourself, and you yourself will experience its
result.’</P>
<P  >6.
“Then, after pressing and questioning and cross-questioning him
about the second divine messenger, King Yama presses and questions
and cross-questions him about the third divine messenger: [181] ‘Good
man, did you not see the third divine messenger to appear in the
world?’ He says: ‘I did not, venerable sir.’ Then King Yama
says: ‘Good man, have you never seen in the world a man - or a
woman - afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill, lying fouled in his
own excrement and urine, lifted up by some and set down by others?’
He says: ‘I have, venerable sir.’</P>
<P  >“Then
King Yama says: ‘Good man, did it never occur to you - an
intelligent and mature man - “I too am subject to sickness, I am
not exempt from sickness: surely I had better do good by body,
speech, and mind”?’ He says: ‘I was unable, venerable sir, I
was negligent.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good man, through
negligence you have failed to do good by body, speech, and mind.
Certainly they will deal with you according to your negligence. But
this evil action of yours was not done by your mother … or by gods:
this evil action was done by you yourself, and you yourself will
experience its result.’</P>
<P  >7.
“Then, after pressing and questioning and cross-questioning him
about the third divine messenger, King Yama presses and questions and
cross-questions him about the fourth divine messenger: ‘Good man,
did you not see the fourth divine messenger to appear in the world?’
He says: ‘I did not, venerable sir.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good
man, have you never seen in the world, when a robber culprit is
caught, kings having many kinds of tortures inflicted on him: having
him flogged with whips … (as Sutta 129, §4) … and having his
head cut off with a sword?’ He says: ‘I have, venerable sir.’</P>
<P  >“Then
King Yama says: ‘Good man, did it never occur to you - an
intelligent and mature man - “Those who do evil actions have such
tortures of various kinds inflicted on them here and now; [182] so
what in the hereafter? Surely I had better do good by body, speech,
and mind”?’ He says: ‘I was unable, venerable sir, I was
negligent.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good man, through negligence
you have failed to do good by body, speech, and mind. Certainly they
will deal with you according to your negligence. But this evil action
of yours was not done by your mother … or by gods: this evil action
was done by you yourself, and you yourself will experience its
result.’</P>
<P  >8.
“Then, after pressing and questioning and cross-questioning him
about the fourth divine messenger, King Yama presses and questions
and cross-questions him about the fifth divine messenger: ‘Good
man, did you not see the fifth divine messenger to appear in the
world?’ He says: ‘I did not, venerable sir.’ Then King Yama
says: ‘Good man, have you never seen in the world a man - or a
woman - one-day dead, two-days dead, three-days dead, bloated, livid,
and oozing with matter?’ He says: ‘I have, venerable sir.’</P>
<P  >“Then
King Yama says: ‘Good man, did it never occur to you - an
intelligent and mature man - “I too am subject to death, I am not
exempt from death: surely I had better do good by body, speech, and
mind”?’ He says: ‘I was unable, venerable sir, I was
negligent.’ Then King Yama says: ‘Good man, through negligence
you have failed to do good by body, speech, and mind. Certainly they
will deal with you according to your negligence. But this evil action
of yours was not done by your mother … or by gods: this evil action
was done by you yourself, and you yourself will experience its
result.’</P>
<P  >9.
“Then, after pressing and questioning and cross-questioning him
about the fifth divine messenger, King Yama is silent.</P>
<P  >10.
“Now the wardens of hell [183] torture him with the fivefold
transfixing.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1208anc" HREF="#sdendnote1208sym"><SUP>mccviii</SUP></A></SUP>
They drive a red-hot iron stake through one hand, they drive a
red-hot iron stake through the other hand, they drive a red-hot iron
stake through one foot, they drive a red-hot iron stake through the
other foot, they drive a red-hot iron stake through his belly. There
he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so
long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >11.
“Next the wardens of hell throw him down and pare him with axes.
There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not
die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >12.
“Next the wardens of hell set him with his feet up and his head
down and pare him with adzes. There he feels painful, racking,
piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so long as that evil action
has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >13.
“Next the wardens of hell harness him to a chariot and drive him
back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. There he
feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so
long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >14.
“Next the wardens of hell make him climb up and down a great mound
of burning coals, blazing and glowing. There he feels painful,
racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so long as that evil
action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >15.
“Next the wardens of hell take him feet up and head down and plunge
him into a red-hot metal cauldron, burning, blazing, and glowing. He
is cooked there in a swirl of froth. And as he is being cooked there
in a swirl of froth, he is swept now up, now down, and now across.
There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not
die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >16.
“Next the wardens of hell throw him into the Great Hell. Now as to
that Great Hell, bhikkhus:</P>
<P >
It has four corners and is built</P>
<P >
With four doors, one set in each side,</P>
<P >
Walled up with iron all around</P>
<P >
And shut in with an iron roof.</P>
<P >
Its floor as well is made of iron</P>
<P >
And heated till it glows with fire.</P>
<P >
The range is a full hundred leagues</P>
<P >
Which it covers all-pervasively.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >17.
“Now the flames that surge out from the Great Hell’s eastern wall
dash against its western wall. The flames that surge out from its
western wall dash against [184] its eastern wall. The flames that
surge out from its northern wall dash against its southern wall. The
flames that surge out from its southern wall dash against its
northern wall. The flames that dash out from the bottom dash against
the top. And the flames that surge out from the top dash against the
bottom. There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he
does not die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its
result.</P>
<P  >18.
“Some time or other, bhikkhus, at the end of a long period, there
comes an occasion when the Great Hell’s eastern door is opened. He
runs towards it, treading quickly. As he does so, his outer skin
burns, his inner skin burns, his flesh burns, his sinews burn, his
bones turn to smoke; and it is the same when his foot is uplifted.
When at long last he reaches the door, then it is shut. There he
feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so
long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >“Some
time or other, at the end of a long period, there comes an occasion
when the Great Hell’s western door is opened … when its northern
door is opened … when its southern door is opened. He runs towards
it, treading quickly … When at long last he reaches the door, then
it is shut. There he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet
he does not die so long as that evil action has not exhausted its
result.</P>
<P  >19.
“Some time or other, bhikkhus, at the end of a long period, there
comes an occasion when the Great Hell’s eastern door is opened. He
runs towards it, treading quickly. As he does so, his outer skin
burns, his inner skin burns, his flesh burns, his sinews burn, his
bones turn to smoke; and it is the same when his foot is uplifted. He
comes out by that door.</P>
<P  >20.
“Immediately next to the Great Hell [185] is the vast Hell of
Excrement. He falls into that. In that Hell of Excrement
needlemouthed creatures bore through his outer skin and bore through
his inner skin and bore through his flesh and bore through his sinews
and bore through his bones and devour his marrow. There he feels
painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so long as
that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >21.
“Immediately next to the Hell of Excrement is the vast Hell of Hot
Embers. He falls into that. There he feels painful, racking, piercing
feelings. Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not
exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >22.
“Immediately next to the Hell of Hot Embers is the vast Wood of
Simbali Trees, a league high, bristling with thorns sixteen
finger-breadths long, burning, blazing, and glowing. They make him
climb up and down those trees. There he feels painful, racking,
piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so long as that evil action
has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >23.
“Immediately next to the Wood of Simbali Trees is a vast Wood of
Sword-leaf Trees. He goes into that. The leaves, stirred</P>
<P  >by
the wind, cut off his hands and cut off his feet and cut off his
hands and feet; they cut off his ears and cut off his nose and cut
off his ears and nose. There he feels painful, racking, piercing
feelings. Yet he does not die so long as that evil action has not
exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >24.
“Immediately next to the Wood of Sword-leaf Trees is a great river
of caustic water. He falls into that. There he is swept upstream and
he is swept downstream and he is swept upstream and downstream. There
he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so
long as that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >25.
“Next the wardens of hell pull him out with a hook, [186] and
setting him on the ground, they ask him: ‘Good man, what do you
want?’ He says: ‘I am hungry, venerable sirs.’ Then the wardens
of hell prise open his mouth with red-hot iron tongs, burning,
blazing, and glowing, and they throw into his mouth a red-hot metal
ball, burning, blazing, and glowing. It burns his lips, it burns his
mouth, it burns his throat, it burns his stomach, and it passes out
below carrying with it his large and small intestines. There he feels
painful, racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so long as
that evil action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >26.
“Next the wardens of hell ask him: ‘Good man, what do you want?’
He says: ‘I am thirsty, venerable sirs.’ Then the wardens of hell
prise open his mouth with red-hot iron tongs, burning, blazing, and
glowing, and they pour into his mouth molten copper, burning,
blazing, and glowing. It burns his lips, it burns his mouth, it burns
his throat, it burns his stomach, and it passes out below carrying
with it his large and small intestines. There he feels painful,
racking, piercing feelings. Yet he does not die so long as that evil
action has not exhausted its result.</P>
<P  >27.
“Then the wardens of hell throw him back again into the Great Hell.</P>
<P  >28.
“It has happened that King Yama thought: ‘Those in the world who
do evil unwholesome actions indeed have all these many kinds of
tortures inflicted on them. Oh, that I might attain the human state,
that a Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened, might appear in
the world, that I might wait on that Blessed One, that the Blessed
One might teach me the Dhamma, and that I might come to understand
that Blessed One’s Dhamma!’</P>
<P  >29.
“Bhikkhus, I tell you this not as something I heard from another
recluse or brahmin. I tell you this as something that I have actually
known, seen, and discovered by myself.” [1871</P>
<P  >30.
That is what the Blessed One said. When the Sublime One had said
that, the Teacher said further:</P>
<P >
“Though warned by the divine messengers,</P>
<P >
Full many are the negligent,</P>
<P >
And people may sorrow long indeed</P>
<P >
Once gone down to the lower world.</P>
<P >
But when by the divine messengers</P>
<P >
Good people here in this life are warned,</P>
<P >
They do not dwell in ignorance</P>
<P >
But practise well the noble Dhamma.</P>
<P >
Clinging they look upon with fear</P>
<P >
For it produces birth and death;</P>
<P >
And by not clinging they are freed</P>
<P >
In the destruction of birth and death.</P>
<P >
They dwell in bliss for they are safe</P>
<P >
And reach Nibbana here and now.</P>
<P >
They are beyond all fear and hate;</P>
<P >
They have escaped all suffering.”</P>
