145. Punnovada Sutta - Advice to Punna</H2>
<P  >[267]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. Then, when it was
evening, the venerable Purina rose from meditation and went to the
Blessed One.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1315anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1315sym"><SUP>mcccxv</SUP></A></SUP>
After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side and
said to him:</P>
<P  >2.
"Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would give me
brief advice. Having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I will
abide alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute."</P>
<P  >"Well
then, Purina, listen and attend carefully to what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," the venerable Purina replied. The Blessed One said
this:</P>
<P  >3.
"Punna, there are forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. If a bhikkhu delights in them, welcomes them,
and remains holding to them, delight arises in him. With the arising
of delight, Punna, there is the arising of suffering, I say.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1316anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1316sym"><SUP>mcccxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
There are, Punna, sounds cognizable by the ear ... odours cognizable
by the nose ... flavours cognizable by the tongue ... tangibles
cognizable by the body ... mind-objects cognizable by the mind that
are wished for, desired, agreeable, and likeable, connected with
sensual desire [268] and provocative of lust. If a bhikkhu delights
in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, delight arises
in him. With the arising of delight, Punna, there is the arising of
suffering, I say.</P>
<P  >4.
"Punna, there are forms cognizable by the eye ... sounds cognizable

by the tongue ... tangibles cognizable by the body ... mind-objects
cognizable by the mind that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and
likeable, connected with sensual desire and provocative of lust. If a
bhikkhu does not delight in them, welcome them, and remain holding to
them, delight ceases in him. With the cessation of delight, Punna,
there is the cessation of suffering, I say.</P>
<P  >5.
"Now that I have given you this brief advice, Punna, in which
country will you dwell?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, now that the Blessed One has given me this brief advice, I am
going to dwell in the Sunaparanta country."</P>
<P  >"Punna,
the people of Sunaparanta are fierce and rough. If they abuse and
threaten you, what will you think then?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta abuse and threaten me, then I shall
think: 'These people of Sunaparanta are kind, truly kind, in that
they did not give me a blow with the fist.' Then I shall think
thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime One."</P>
<P  >"But,
Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with the fist,
what will you think then?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with the fist,
then I shall think: 'These people of Sunaparanta are kind, truly
kind, in that they did not give me a blow with a clod.' Then I
shall think thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime One."</P>
<P  >"But,
Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a clod,
what will you think then?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with a clod, then
I shall think: 'These people of Sunaparanta are kind, truly kind,
in that they did not give me a blow with a stick.' Then I shall
think thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime One."
[269]</P>
<P  >"But,
Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a stick,
what will you think then?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with a stick,
then I shall think: 'These people of Sunaparanta are kind, truly
kind, in that they did not give me a blow with a knife.' Then I
shall think thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime One."</P>
<P  >"But,
Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta do give you a blow with a knife,
what will you think then?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta do give me a blow with a knife,
then I shall think: 'These people of Sunaparanta are kind, truly
kind, in that they have not taken my life with a sharp knife.' Then
I shall think thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime
One."</P>
<P  >"But,
Punna, if the people of Sunaparanta do take your life with a sharp
knife, what will you think then?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, if the people of Sunaparanta do take my life with a sharp knife,
then I shall think thus: 'There have been disciples of the Blessed
One who, being humiliated and disgusted by the body and by life,
sought to have their lives deprived by the knife. But I have had my
life deprived by the knife without seeking for it.' Then I shall
think thus, Blessed One; then I shall think thus, Sublime One."</P>
<P  >6.
"Good, good, Punna! Possessing such self-control and peacefulness,
you will be able to dwell in the Sunaparanta country. Now, Punna, it
is time to do as you think fit."</P>
<P  >7.
Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words, the
venerable Punna rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the
Blessed One, departed keeping him on his right. He then set his
resting place in order, took his bowl and outer robe, and set out to
wander towards the Sunaparanta country. Wandering by stages, he
eventually arrived in the Sunaparanta country, and there he lived.
Then, during that Rains, the venerable Punna established five hundred
men lay followers and five hundred women lay followers in the
practice, and he himself realised the three true knowledges. On a
later occasion, the venerable Punna attained final Nibbana.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1317anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1317sym"><SUP>mcccxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
Then a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him: "Venerable
sir, the clansman Punna, who [270] was given brief advice by the
Blessed One, has died. What is his destination? What is his future
course?"</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhus,
the clansman Punna was wise. He practised in accordance with the
Dhamma and did not trouble me in the interpretation of the Dhamma.
The clansman Punna has attained final Nibbana."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
