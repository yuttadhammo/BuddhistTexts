104. Samagama Sutta - At Samagama</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
Sakyan country at Samagama.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the Nigantha Nataputta had just died at Pava.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote976anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote976sym"><SUP>cmlxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
On his death the Niganthas divided, split into two; and they had
taken to quarrelling and brawling and were deep in disputes, stabbing
each other with verbal daggers: "You do not understand this Dhamma
and Discipline. I understand this Dhamma and Discipline. How could
you understand this Dhamma and Discipline? Your way is wrong. My way
is right. I am consistent. You are inconsistent. What should have
been said first [244] you said last. What should have been said last
you said first. What you had so carefully thought up has been turned
inside out. Your assertion has been shown up. You are refuted. Go and
learn better, or disentangle yourself if you can!" It seemed as if
there were nothing but slaughter among the Nigantha Nataputta's
pupils. And his white-clothed lay disciples were disgusted, dismayed,
and disappointed with the Nigantha Nataputta's pupils, as they were
with his badly proclaimed and badly expounded Dhamma and Discipline,
which was unemancipating, unconducive to peace, expounded by one not
fully enlightened, and was now with its shrine broken, left without a
refuge.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote977anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote977sym"><SUP>cmlxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Then the novice Cunda,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote978anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote978sym"><SUP>cmlxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
who had spent the Rains at Pava, went to the venerable Ananda, and
after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told him what
was taking place.</P>
<P  >The
venerable Ananda then said to the novice Cunda: "Friend Cunda, this
is news that should be told to the Blessed One. Come, let us approach
the Blessed One and tell him this."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," the novice Cunda replied.</P>
<P  >4.
Then the venerable Ananda and the novice Cunda went together to the
Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side,
and [245] the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "This
novice Cunda, venerable sir, says thus: 'Venerable sir, the
Nigantha Nataputta has just died. On his death the Niganthas divided,
split into two ... and is now with its shrine broken, left without a
refuge.' I thought, venerable sir: 'Let no dispute arise in the
Sangha when the Blessed One has gone. For such a dispute would be for
the harm and unhappiness of many, for the loss, harm, and suffering
of gods and humans.'"</P>
<P  >5.
"What do you think, Ananda? These things that I have taught you
after directly knowing them - that is, the four foundations of
mindfulness, the four right kinds of striving, the four bases for
spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven
enlightenment factors, the Noble Eightfold Path - do you see, Ananda,
even two bhikkhus who make differing assertions about these things?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir, I do not see even two bhikkhus who make differing
assertions about these things. But, venerable sir, there are people
who live deferential towards the Blessed One who might, when he has
gone, create a dispute in the Sangha about livelihood and about the
Patimokkha.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote979anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote979sym"><SUP>cmlxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
Such a dispute would be for the harm and unhappiness of many, for the
loss, harm, and suffering of gods and humans."</P>
<P  >"A
dispute about livelihood or about the Patimokkha would be trifling,
Ananda. But should a dispute arise in the Sangha about the path or
the way,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote980anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote980sym"><SUP>cmlxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
such a dispute would be for the harm and unhappiness of many, for the
loss, harm, and suffering of gods and humans.</P>
<P  >6.
"There are, Ananda, these six roots of disputes.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote981anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote981sym"><SUP>cmlxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
What six? Here, Ananda, a bhikkhu is angry and revengeful. Such a
bhikkhu dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher,
towards the Dhamma, and towards the Sangha, and he does not fulfil
the training. A bhikkhu who dwells disrespectful and undeferential
towards the Teacher, towards the Dhamma, and towards the Sangha,
[246] and who does not fulfil the training, creates a dispute in the
Sangha, which would be for the harm and unhappiness of many, for the
loss, harm, and suffering of gods and humans. Now if you see any such
root of dispute either in yourselves or externally, you should strive
to abandon</P>
<P  >that
same evil root of dispute. And if you do not see any such root of
dispute either in yourselves or externally, you should practise in
such a way that that same evil root of dispute does not erupt in the
future. Thus there is the abandoning of that evil root of dispute;
thus there is the non-eruption of that evil root of dispute in the
future.</P>
<P  >7-11.
"Again, a bhikkhu is contemptuous and domineering ... envious and
avaricious ... deceitful and fraudulent ... has evil wishes and wrong
view ... adheres to his own views, holds on to them tenaciously, and
relinquishes them with difficulty. Such a bhikkhu dwells
disrespectful and undeferential towards the Teacher, towards the
Dhamma, and towards the Sangha, and he does not fulfil the training.
A bhikkhu who dwells disrespectful and undeferential towards the
Teacher, towards the Dhamma, and towards the Sangha, and who does not
fulfil the training, creates a dispute in the Sangha, which would be
for the harm and unhappiness of many, for the loss, harm, and
suffering of gods and humans. Now if you see any such root of dispute
either in yourselves or externally, you should strive to abandon that
same evil root of dispute. And if you do not see any such root of
dispute either in yourselves or externally, you should practise in
such a way that that same evil root of dispute does not erupt in the
future. [247] Thus there is the abandoning of that evil root of
dispute; thus there is the non-eruption of that evil root of dispute
in the future. These are the six roots of dispute.</P>
<P  >12.
"Ananda, there are these four kinds of litigation. What four?
Litigation because of a dispute, litigation because of an accusation,
litigation because of an offence, and litigation concerning
proceedings. These are the four kinds of litigation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote982anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote982sym"><SUP>cmlxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >13.
"Ananda, there are these seven kinds of settlement of litigation.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote983anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote983sym"><SUP>cmlxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
For the settlement and pacification of litigations whenever they
arise: removal of litigation by confrontation may be provided,
removal of litigation on account of memory may be provided, removal
of litigation on account of past insanity may be provided, the
effecting of acknowledgement of an offence, the opinion of the
majority, the pronouncement of bad character against someone, and
covering over with grass.</P>
<P  >14.
"And how is there removal of litigation by confrontation?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote984anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote984sym"><SUP>cmlxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Here bhikkhus are disputing: 'It is Dhamma,' or 'It is not
Dhamma,' or 'It is Discipline,' or 'It is not Discipline.'
Those bhikkhus should all meet together in concord. Then, having met
together, the guideline of the Dhamma should be drawn out.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote985anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote985sym"><SUP>cmlxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Once the guideline of the Dhamma has been drawn out, that litigation
should be settled in a way that accords with it. Such is the removal
of litigation by confrontation. And so there comes to be the
settlement of some litigations here by removal of litigation by
confrontation.</P>
<P  >15.
"And how is there the opinion of a majority? If those bhikkhus
cannot settle that litigation in that dwelling place, they should go
to a dwelling place where there is a greater number of bhikkhus.
There they should all meet together in concord. Then, having met
together, the guideline of the Dhamma should be drawn out. Once the
guideline of the Dhamma has been drawn out, that litigation should be
settled in a way that accords with it. Such is the opinion of a
majority. And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations
here by the opinion of a majority.</P>
<P  >16.
"And how is there removal of litigation on account of memory?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote986anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote986sym"><SUP>cmlxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Here one bhikkhu reproves another bhikkhu for such and such a grave
offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote987anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote987sym"><SUP>cmlxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
'Does the venerable one remember having committed such and such a
grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat?' He
says: 'I do not, friends, remember having committed such and such a
grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat.' [248]
In his case removal of litigation on account of memory should be
pronounced. Such is the removal of litigation on account of memory.
And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by
removal of litigation on account of memory.</P>
<P  >17.
"And how is there removal of litigation on account of past
insanity?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote988anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote988sym"><SUP>cmlxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here one bhikkhu reproves another bhikkhu for such and such a grave
offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat: 'Does the
venerable one remember having committed such and such a grave
offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat?' He says: 'I
do not, friends, remember having committed such and such a grave
offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat.' Despite the
denial, the former presses the latter further: 'Surely the
venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having committed
such and such a grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on
defeat?' He says: 'I had gone mad, friend, I was out of my mind,
and when I was mad I said and did many things improper for a recluse.
I do not remember, I was mad when I did that.' In his case removal
of litigation on account of past insanity should be pronounced. Such
is the removal of litigation on account of past insanity. And so
there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by removal
of litigation on account of past insanity.</P>
<P  >18.
"And how is there the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence?
Here a bhikkhu, whether reproved or unreproved, remembers an offence,
reveals it, and discloses it. He should go to a senior bhikkhu, and
after arranging his robe on one shoulder, he should pay homage at his
feet. Then, sitting on his heels, he should raise his hands palms
together and say: 'Venerable sir, I have committed such and such an
offence; I confess it.' The other says: 'Do you see?' - 'Yes,
I see.' - 'Will you practise restraint in the future?' - 'I
will practise restraint in the future.' Such is the effecting of
acknowledgement of an offence.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote989anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote989sym"><SUP>cmlxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations here by
the effecting of acknowledgement of an offence. [249]</P>
<P  >19.
"And how is there the pronouncement of bad character against
someone?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote990anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote990sym"><SUP>cmxc</SUP></A></SUP>
Here one bhikkhu reproves another for such and such a grave offence,
one involving defeat or bordering on defeat: 'Does the venerable
one remember having committed such and such a grave offence, one
involving defeat or bordering on defeat?' He says: 'I do not,
friends, remember having committed such and such a grave offence, one
involving defeat or bordering on defeat.' Despite the denial, the
former presses the latter further: 'Surely the venerable one must
know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a
grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat?' He
says: 'I do not, friends, remember having committed such and such a
grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat. But,
friends, I remember having committed such and such a minor offence.'
Despite the denial, the former presses the latter further: 'Surely
the venerable one must know quite well if he remembers having
committed such and such a grave offence, one involving defeat or
bordering on defeat?' He says: 'Friends, when not asked I
acknowledge having committed this minor offence; so when asked, why
shouldn't I acknowledge having committed such and such a grave
offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat?' The other
says: 'Friend, if you had not been asked, you would not have
acknowledged committing this minor offence; so why, when asked, would
you acknowledge having committed such and such a grave offence, one
involving defeat or bordering on defeat? Surely the venerable one
must know quite well if he remembers having committed such and such a
grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat?' He
says: 'I remember, friends, having committed such and such a grave
offence, one involving defeat or bordering on defeat. I was hurried,
I was confused, when I said that I did not remember having committed
such and such a grave offence, one involving defeat or bordering on
defeat.' Such is the pronouncement of bad character against
someone. And so there comes to be the settlement of some litigations
here by the pronouncement of bad character against someone. [250]</P>

"And how is there covering over with grass?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote991anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote991sym"><SUP>cmxci</SUP></A></SUP>
Here when bhikkhus have taken to quarreling and brawling and are deep
in disputes, they may have said and done many things improper for a
recluse. Those bhikkhus should all meet together in concord. When
they have met together, a wise bhikkhu among the bhikkhus who side
together on the one part should rise from his seat, and after
arranging his robe on one shoulder, he should raise his hands, palms
together, and call for an enactment of the Sangha thus: 'Let the
venerable Sangha hear me. When we took to quarreling and brawling and
were deep in disputes, we said and did many things improper for a
recluse. If it is approved by the Sangha, then for the good of these
venerable ones and for my own good, in the midst of the Sangha I
shall confess, by the method of covering over with grass, any
offences of these venerable ones and any offences of my own, except
for those which call for serious censure and those connected with the
laity.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote992anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote992sym"><SUP>cmxcii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

"Ananda, there are these six memorable qualities that create love

What are the six?</P>
<P  >"Here
a bhikkhu maintains bodily acts of loving-kindness both in public and

<P  >"Again,

a bhikkhu maintains mental acts of loving-kindness both in public and

memorable quality that creates love [251] and respect, and conduces

<P  >"Again,
a bhikkhu enjoys things in common with his virtuous companions in the
holy life; without making reservations, he shares with them any gain
of a kind that accords with the Dhamma and has been obtained in a way
that accords with the Dhamma, including even what is in his bowl.
This is a memorable quality that creates love and respect, and
conduces to ... unity.</P>
<P  >"Again,
a bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private possessing in common
with his companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken,
untorn, unblotched, unmottled, liberating, commended by the wise, not
misapprehended, and conducive to concentration. This too is a
memorable quality that creates love and respect and conduces to ...
unity.</P>
<P  >"Again,
a bhikkhu dwells both in public and in private possessing in common
with his companions in the holy life that view that is noble and

quality that creates love and respect, and conduces to helpfulness,
