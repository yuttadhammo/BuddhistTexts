61. Ambalatthikarahulovada Sutta - Advice to Rahula at Ambalatthika</H2>
<P  >[414]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the venerable Rahula was living at
Ambalatthika.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote637anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote637sym"><SUP>dcxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and
went to the venerable Rahula at Ambalatthika. The venerable Rahula
saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and made a seat ready and
set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the
seat made ready and washed his feet. The venerable Rahula paid homage
to him and sat down at one side.</P>
<P  >3.
Then the Blessed One left a little water in the water vessel and
asked the venerable Rahula: "Rahula, do you see this little water
left in the water vessel?" - "Yes, venerable sir." - "Even so
little, Rahula, is the recluseship of those who are not ashamed to
tell a deliberate lie."</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One threw away the little water that was left and
asked the venerable Rahula: "Rahula, do you see that little water
that was thrown away?" - "Yes, venerable sir." - "Even so,
Rahula, those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie have
thrown away their recluseship."</P>
<P  >5.
Then the Blessed One turned the water vessel upside down and asked
the venerable Rahula: "Rahula, do you see this water vessel turned
upside down?" - "Yes, venerable sir." - "Even so, Rahula,
those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie have turned their
recluseship upside down."</P>
<P  >6.
Then the Blessed One turned the water vessel right way up again and
asked the venerable Rahula: "Rahula, do you see this hollow, empty
water vessel?" - "Yes, venerable sir." - "Even so hollow and
empty, Rahula, is the recluseship of those who are not ashamed to
tell a deliberate lie."</P>
<P  >7.
"Suppose, Rahula, there were a royal tusker elephant with tusks as
long as chariot poles, full-grown in stature, high-bred, and
accustomed to battle. In battle he would perform his task with his
forefeet and his hindfeet, with his forequarters and his
hindquarters, with his head and his ears, with his tusks and his
tail, [415] yet he would keep back his trunk. Then his rider would
think: 'This royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as chariot
poles ... performs his task in battle with his forefeet and his
hindfeet. . .yet he keeps back his trunk. He has not yet given up his
life.' But when the royal tusker elephant ... performs his task in
battle with his forefeet and his hindfeet, with his forequarters and
his hindquarters, with his head and his ears, with his tusks and his
tail, and also with his trunk, then his rider would think: 'This
royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as chariot poles ...
performs his task in battle with his forefeet and his hindfeet ...
and also with his trunk. He has given up his life. Now there is
nothing this royal tusker elephant would not do.' So too, Rahula,
when one is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no evil, I
say, that one would not do. Therefore, Rahula, you should train thus:
'I will not utter a falsehood even as a joke.'</P>
<P  >8.
"What do you think, Rahula? What is the purpose of a mirror?"</P>
<P  >"For
the purpose of reflection, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"So
too, Rahula, an action with the body should be done after repeated
reflection; an action by speech should be done after repeated
reflection; an action by mind should be done after repeated
reflection.</P>
<P  >9.
"Rahula, when you wish to do an action with the body, you should
reflect upon that same bodily action thus: 'Would this action that
I wish to do with the body lead to my own affliction, or to the
affliction of others, or to the affliction of both? Is it an
unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, with painful
results?' When you reflect, if you know: 'This action that I wish
to do with the body would lead to my own affliction, or to the
affliction of others, or to the affliction of both; it is an
unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, with painful
results,' then you definitely should not do such an action with the
body. [416] But when you reflect, if you know: 'This action that I
wish to do with the body would not lead to my own affliction, or to
the affliction of others, or tc the affliction of both; it is a
wholesome bodily action with pleasant consequences, with pleasant
results,' then you may dc such an action with the body.</P>
<P  >10.
"Also, Rahula, while you are doing an action with the body, you
should reflect upon that same bodily action thus: 'Does this action
that I am doing with the body lead to my own affliction, or to the
affliction of others, or to the affliction of both? Is it an
unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, with painful
results?' When you reflect, if you know: 'This action that I am
doing with the body leads to my own affliction, or to the affliction
of others, or to the affliction of both; it is an unwholesome bodily
action with painful consequences, with painful results,' then you
should suspend such a bodily action. But when you reflect, if you
know: 'This action that I am doing with the body does not lead to
my own affliction, or to the affliction of others, or to the
affliction of both; it is a wholesome bodily action with pleasant
consequences, with pleasant results,' then you may continue in such
a bodily action.</P>
<P  >11.
"Also, Rahula, after you have done an action with the body, you
should reflect upon that same bodily action thus: 'Does this action
that I have done with the body lead to my own affliction, or to the
affliction of others, or to the affliction of both? Was it an
unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences, with painful
results?' When you reflect, if you know: 'This action that I have
done with the body leads to my own affliction, or to the affliction
of others, or to the affliction of both; it was an unwholesome bodily
action with painful consequences, with painful results,' then you
should confess such a bodily action, reveal it, and lay it open to
the Teacher or to your wise companions in the holy life. Having
confessed it, revealed it, and laid it open, [417] you should
undertake restraint for the future.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote638anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote638sym"><SUP>dcxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
But when you reflect, if you know: 'This action that I have done
with the body does not lead to my own affliction, or to the
affliction of others, or to the affliction of both; it was a
wholesome bodily action with pleasant consequences, pleasant
results,' you can abide happy and glad, training day and night in
wholesome states.</P>
<P  >12.
"Rahula, when you wish to do an action by speech ... (complete as
in §9, substituting "speech" for "body") ... you may do such
an action by speech.</P>
<P  >13.
"Also, Rahula, while you are doing an action by speech ...
(complete as in §10, substituting "speech" for "body") [418]
... you may continue in such an action by speech.</P>
<P  >14.
"Also, Rahula, after you have done an action by speech ...
(complete as in §11, substituting "speech" for "body") ...
you can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome
states.</P>
<P  >15.
"Rahula, when you wish to do an action by mind ... (complete as in
§9, substituting "mind" for "body") [419] ... you may do
such an action by mind.</P>
<P  >16.
"Also, Rahula, while you are doing an action by mind ... (complete
as in §10, substituting "mind" for "body") ... you may
continue in such a mental action.</P>
<P  >17.
"Also, Rahula, after you have done an action by mind ... (complete
as in §11, substituting "mind" for "body"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote639anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote639sym"><SUP>dcxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>)
.you can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome
states. [420]</P>
<P  >18.
"Rahula, whatever recluses and brahmins in the past purified their
bodily action, their verbal action, and their mental action, all did
so by repeatedly reflecting thus. Whatever recluses and brahmins in
the future will purify their bodily action, their verbal action, and
their mental action, all will do so by repeatedly reflecting thus.
Whatever recluses and brahmins in the present are purifying their
bodily action, their verbal action, and their mental action, all are
doing so by repeatedly reflecting thus. Therefore, Rahula, you should
train thus: 'We will purify our bodily action, our verbal action,
and our mental action by repeatedly reflecting upon them.'"</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Rahula was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
