135. Culakammavibhanga Sutta - The Shorter Exposition of Action</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatth-1 in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya's son, went to the Blessed
One and exchanged greetings with him.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1223anc" HREF="#sdendnote1223sym"><SUP>mccxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one
side and asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >3.
"Master Gotama, what is the cause and condition why human beings
are seen to be inferior and superior? For people are seen to be
short-lived and long-lived, sickly and healthy, ugly and beautiful,
uninfluential and influential, poor and wealthy, low-born and
high-born, stupid and [203] wise. What is the cause and condition,
Master Gotama, why human beings are seen to be inferior and
superior?"</P>
<P  >4.
"Student, beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their
actions; they originate from their actions, are bound to their
actions, have their actions as their refuge. It is action that
distinguishes beings as inferior and superior."</P>
<P  >"I
do not understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotama's
statement, which he spoke in brief without expounding the meaning in
detail. It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma
so that I might understand in detail the meaning of Master Gotama's
statement."</P>
<P  >"Then,
student, listen and attend closely to what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," the brahmin student Subha replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >5.
"Here, student, some man or woman kills living beings and is
murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless to
living beings. Because of performing and undertaking such action, on
the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.
But if on the dissolution of the body, after death, he does not
reappear in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in
perdition, in hell, but instead comes back to the human state, then
wherever he is reborn he is shortlived.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1224anc" HREF="#sdendnote1224sym"><SUP>mccxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the way, student, that leads to short life, namely, one kills
living being and is murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and
violence, merciless to living beings.</P>
<P  >6.
"But here, student, some man or woman, abandoning the killing of
living beings, abstains from killing living beings; with rod and
weapon laid aside, gentle and kindly, he abides compassionate to all
living beings. Because of performing and undertaking such action, on
the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world. But if on the dissolution of
the body, after death, he does not reappear in a happy destination,
in the heavenly world, but instead comes back to the human state,
then wherever he is reborn he is long-lived.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1225anc" HREF="#sdendnote1225sym"><SUP>mccxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the way, student, that leads to long life, namely, abandoning
the killing of living beings, [204] one abstains from killing living
beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gentle and kindly, one abides
compassionate to all living beings.</P>
<P  >7.
"Here, student, some man or woman is given to injuring beings with
the hand, with a clod, with a stick, or with a knife. Because of
performing and undertaking such action, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, he reappears in a state of deprivation … But if
instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn
he is sickly. This is the way, student, that leads to sickliness,
namely, one is given to injuring beings with the hand, with a clod,
with a stick, or with a knife.</P>
<P  >8.
"But here, student, some man or woman is not given to injuring
beings with the hand, with a clod, with a stick, or with a knife.
Because of performing and undertaking such action, on the dissolution
of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy destination … But
if instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is
reborn he is healthy. This is the way, student, that leads to health,
namely, one is not given to injuring beings with the hand, with a
clod, with a stick, or with a knife.</P>
<P  >9.
"Here, student, some man or woman is of an angry and irritable
character; even when criticised a little, he is offended, becomes
angry, hostile, and resentful, and displays anger, hate, and
bitterness. Because of performing and undertaking such action … he
reappears in a state of deprivation … But if instead he comes back
to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is ugly. This is
the way, student, that leads to ugliness, namely, one is of an angry
and irritable character … and displays anger, hate, and bitterness.</P>
<P  >10.
"But here, student, some man or woman is not of an angry and
irritable character; even when criticised a little, he is not
offended, does not become angry, hostile, and resentful, and does not
display anger, hate, and bitterness. Because of performing and
undertaking such action … he reappears in a happy destination …
But if instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is
reborn he is beautiful. This is the way, student, that leads to being
beautiful, namely, one is not of an angry and irritable character …
and does not display anger, hate, and bitterness.</P>
<P  >11.
"Here, student, some man or woman is envious, one who envies,
resents, and begrudges the gains, honour, respect, reverence,
salutations, and veneration received by others. Because of performing
and undertaking such action … he reappears in a state of
deprivation … But if instead he comes back to the human state, then
wherever he is reborn he is uninfluential. This is the way, student,
that leads to being uninfluential, namely, one is envious … towards
the gains, honour, respect, reverence, salutations, and veneration
received by others. [205]</P>
<P  >12.
"But here, student, some man or woman is not envious, one who does
not envy, resent, and begrudge the gains, honour, respect, reverence,

But if instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is
reborn he is influential. This is the way, student, that leads to
being influential, namely, one is not envious … towards the gains,
honour, respect, reverence, salutations, and veneration received by
others.</P>
<P  >13.
"Here, student, some man or woman does not give food, drink,
clothing, carriages, garlands, scents, unguents, beds, dwelling, and
lamps to recluses or brahmins. Because of performing and undertaking
such action … he reappears in a state of deprivation … But if
instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn
he is poor. This is the way, student, that leads to poverty, namely,
one does not give food … and lamps to recluses or brahmins.</P>
<P  >14.
"But here, student, some man or woman gives food … and lamps to

action … he reappears in a happy destination … But if instead he
comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is
wealthy. This is the way, student, that leads to wealth, namely, one
gives food … and lamps to recluses or brahmins.</P>
<P  >15.
"Here, student, some man or woman is obstinate and arrogant; he
does not pay homage to one who should receive homage, does not rise
up for one in whose presence he should rise up, does not offer a seat
to one who deserves a seat, does not make way for one for whom he
should make way, and does not honour, respect, revere, and venerate
one who should be honoured, respected, revered, and venerated.
Because of performing and undertaking such action … he reappears in
a state of deprivation … But if instead he comes back to the human
state, then wherever he is reborn he is low-born. This is the way,
student, that leads to low birth, namely, one is obstinate and
arrogant … and does not honour, respect, revere, and venerate one
who should be honoured, respected, revered, and venerated.</P>
<P  >16.
"But here, student, some man or woman is not obstinate and
arrogant; he pays homage to one who should receive homage, rises up

deserves a seat, makes way for one for whom he should make way, and
honours, respects, reveres, and venerates one who should be honoured,

"Here, student, some man or woman does not visit a recluse or a
brahmin and ask: 'Venerable sir, what is wholesome? What is
unwholesome? What is blameable? What is blameless? What should be
cultivated? What should not be cultivated? What kind of action will
lead to my harm and suffering for a long time? What kind of action
will lead to my welfare and</P>
<P  >happiness
for a long time?' Because of performing and undertaking such action
… he reappears in a state of deprivation … But if instead he
comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is
stupid. This is the way, student, that leads to stupidity, namely,
one does not visit a recluse or brahmin and ask such questions. [206]</P>
<P  >18.

and asks: 'Venerable sir, what is wholesome?.. .What kind of action
will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time?' Because of
performing and undertaking such action … he reappears in a happy

wherever he is reborn he is wise. This is the way, student, that
leads to wisdom, namely, one visits a recluse or brahmin and asks

"Thus, student, the way that leads to short life makes people
short-lived, the way that leads to long life makes people long-lived;
the way that leads to sickliness makes people sickly, the way that
leads to health makes people healthy; the way that leads to ugliness
makes people ugly, the way that leads to being beautiful makes people
beautiful; the way that leads to being uninfluential makes people
uninfluential, the way that leads to being influential makes people

that leads to wealth makes people wealthy; the way that leads to low
birth makes people low-born, the way that leads to high birth makes
people highborn; the way that leads to stupidity makes people stupid,
the way that leads to wisdom makes people wise.</P>

"Beings are owners of their actions, student, heirs of their
actions; they originate from their actions, are bound to their
actions, have their actions as their refuge. It is action that
distinguishes beings as inferior and superior."</P>
<P  >21.
When this was said, the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya's son, said
to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent,
Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways,
as though he were turning upright what had been overturned, revealing
what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a
lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master
Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus.
Let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him
for refuge for life."</P>
