Mulapariyaya Sutta – The Root of All Things</H5>
<P  ><SUP></SUP>
For a fuller treatment of this important and difficult sutta, see
Bhikkhu Bodhi, Discourse on the Root of Existence. This work
contains, besides a translation of the sutta, a lengthy analytical
study of its philosophical significance and copious extracts from
the very helpful commentarial literature that has accumulated around
it. Nm’s rendering of this sutta in Ms was highly conjectural;
thus, while I have retained most of his terminology, I have
substituted my own rendering of the syntax to bring out the meaning
that accords with the traditional interpretation and that seems
warranted by the original Pali text as well. The key passages as Nm
rendered them will be given in the Notes.</P>

MA explains that the Buddha delivered this sutta to dispel the
conceit that had arisen in five hundred bhikkhus on account of their
erudition and intellectual mastery of the Buddha’s teachings.
These bhikkhus were formerly brahmins learned in the Vedic
literature, and the Buddha’s cryptic utterances may well have been
intended to challenge the brahmanic views to which they may still
have adhered.</P>

Sabbadhammamulapariyaya. MT explains that the word “all” (sabba)
is being used here in the restricted sense of the “all of
personality” (sakkayasabba), that is, with reference to all states
or phenomena (dhamma) comprised within the five aggregates affected
by clinging (see MN 28.4). Supramundane states - the paths, fruits,
and Nibbana - are excluded. The “root of all things” - that is,
the special condition that maintains the continuity of the process
of repeated existence - MT explains to be craving, conceit, and
views (which are the underlying springs of “conceiving”), and.
these in turn are underlaid by ignorance, suggested in the sutta by
the phrase “he has not fully understood it.”</P>

The “untaught ordinary person” (assutava puthujjana) is the
common worldling, who possesses neither learning nor spiritual
accomplishment in the Dhamma of the noble ones, and allows himself
to be dominated by the multitude of defilements and wrong views. See
Bodhi, Discourse on the Root of Existence, pp. 40-46.</P>

Pathavitn pathavito sanjanati. Although perceiving “earth as
earth” seems to suggest seeing the object as it really is, the aim
of Buddhist insight meditation, the context makes it clear that the
ordinary person’s perception of “earth as earth” already
introduces a slight distortion of the object, a distortion that will
be blown up into fullfledged misinterpretation when the cognitive
process enters the phase of “conceiving.” MA explains that the
ordinary person seizes upon the conventional expression “it is
earth,” and applying this to the object, perceives it through a
“perversion of perception” (sannavipallasa). The latter is a
technical expression explained as perceiving the impermanent as
permanent, the painful as pleasurable, what is not self as self, and
what is foul as beautiful (AN 4:49/ii.52). 1SIm reads the ablative
suffix -to of the Pali as signifying derivation and translates the
phrase: “From earth he has a percept of earth.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote6">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote6sym" HREF="#sdendnote6anc">vi</A>
The Pali verb “conceives” (mannati), from the root man, “to
think,” is often used in the Pali suttas to mean distortional
thinking - thought that ascribes to its object characteristics and a
significance derived not from the object itself, but from its own
subjective imaginings. The cognitive distortion introduced by
conceiving consists, in brief, in the intrusion of the egocentric
perspective into the experience already slightly distorted by
spontaneous perception. According to the commentaries, the activity
of conceiving is governed by three defilements, which accounts for
the different ways it comes to manifestation - craving (tanha),
conceit (mana), and views (ditthi).</P>
<P  >MA
paraphrases this text thus: “Having perceived earth with a
perverted perception, the ordinary person afterwards conceives it -
construes or discriminates it - through the gross proliferating
tendencies (papanca) of craving, conceit, and views, which are here
called ‘conceivings.’ … He apprehends it in diverse ways
contrary [to reality].”</P>
<P  >The
four ways of conceiving (mannana): The Buddha shows that the
conceiving of any object may occur in any of four ways, expressed by
the text as a fourfold linguistic pattern: accusative, locative,
ablative, and appropriative. The primary significance of this modal
pattern - enigmatic in the Pali as well - seems to be ontological. I
take the pattern to represent the diverse ways in which the ordinary
person attempts to give positive being to his imagined sense of
egohood by positing, below the threshold of reflection, a
relationship between himself as the subject of cognition and the
perceived phenomenon as its object. According to the fourfold
pattern given, this relationship may be one either of direct
identification (“he conceives X”), or of inherence (“he
conceives in X”), or of contrast or derivation (“he conceives
from X”), or of simple appropriation (“he conceives X to be
‘mine”‘).</P>
<P  >But
care is needed in interpreting these phrases. The Pali does not
supply any direct object for the second and third modes, and this
suggests that the process at work in conceiving proceeds from a
deeper and more general level than that involved in the forming of
an explicit view of self, as described for example at MN 2.8 or MN
44.7. The activity of conceiving thus seems to comprise the entire
range of subjectively tinged cognition, from the impulses and
thoughts in which the sense of personal identity is still inchoate
to elaborate intellectual structures in which it has been fully
explicated.</P>
<P  >Nm,
however, understands the implicit object of conceiving to be the
percept itself, and accordingly translates: “having had from earth
a percept of earth, he conceives [that to be] earth, he conceives
[that to be] in earth, he conceives [that to be apart] from earth,”
etc.</P>
<P  >The
fifth phrase, “he delights in X,” explicitly connects conceiving
with craving, which is elsewhere said to “delight here and there.”
This, moreover, hints at the danger in the worldling’s thought
processes, since craving is pointed to by the Buddha as the origin
of suffering.</P>
<P  >MA
gives prolific examples illustrating all the different modes of
conceiving, and these clearly establish that the intended object of
conceiving is the misplaced sense of egoity.</P>

MA states that one who fully understands earth does so by the three
types of full understanding: the full understanding of the known
(nataparinna) - the definition of the earth element by way of its
unique characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause;
the full understanding by scrutinization (tiranaparinna) - the
contemplation of the earth element by way of the three general
characteristics of impermanence, suffering, and non-self; and the
full understanding of abandonment (pahanaparinna) - the abandoning
of desire and lust for the earth element through the supreme path
(of arahantship).</P>

Bhuta. MA says that “beings” here signifies only living beings
below the heaven of the Four Great Kings, the lowest of the
sense-sphere heavens; the higher grades of living beings are covered
by the terms to follow. MA exemplifies the application of the three
types of conceiving to this situation as follows: When a person
becomes attached to beings as a result of sight, hearing, etc., or
desires rebirth in a certain class of beings, this is conceiving due
to craving. When he ranks himself as superior, equal, or inferior to
others, this is conceiving due to conceit. And when he thinks,
“Beings are permanent, stable, eternal,” etc., this is
conceiving due to views.</P>

Abhibhu. MA says this term is a designation for the nonpercipient
realm, called thus because it vanquishes (abhibhavati) the four
immaterial aggregates. The identification sounds contrived,
especially because the word “abhibhu” is a masculine singular
noun. Elsewhere (MN 49.5) the word appears as part of Baka the
Brahma’s claim to theocratic hegemony, yet MA rejects identifying
the Abhibhu with Brahma here as a redundancy.</P>

This and the next three sections deal with conceiving in relation to

In these four sections the phenomena comprising personality are
considered as objects of perception classified into the four
categories of the seen, heard, sensed, and cognized. Here, sensed
(muta) signifies the data of smell, taste, and touch, cognized
(vinnata) the data of introspection, abstract thought, and
imagination. The objects of perception are “conceived” when they
are cognized in terms of “mine,” “I,” and “self,” or in
ways that generate craving, conceit, and views.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote18">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote18sym" HREF="#sdendnote18anc">xviii</A>
In this section and the next, the phenomena comprising personality
are treated as twofold - by way of unity and diversity. The emphasis
on unity (ekatta), MA informs us, is characteristic of one who
attains the jhanas, in which the mind occurs in a single mode on a
single object. The emphasis on diversity (nanatta) prevails in the
case of the non-attainer who lacks the overwhelming unitive
experience of jhanas. Conceivings stressing diversity come to
expression in philosophies of pluralism, those stressing unity in
philosophies of the monistic type.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote19">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote19sym" HREF="#sdendnote19anc">xix</A>
In this section, all phenomena of personality are collected together
and shown as singlefold. This idea of totality can form the basis
for philosophies of the pantheistic or monistic type, depending on
the relation posited between the self and the all.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote20">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote20sym" HREF="#sdendnote20anc">xx</A>
MA understands “Nibbana” here to refer to the five kinds of
“supreme Nibbana here and now” included among the sixty-two
wrong views of the Brahmajala Sutta (DN 1.3.19-25/i.36-38), that is,
Nibbana identified with the full enjoyment of sense pleasures or
with the four jhanas. Enjoying this state, or yearning for it, he
conceives it with craving. Priding himself on attaining it, he
conceives it with conceit. Holding this imaginary Nibbana to be
permanent, etc., he conceives it with views.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote21">

The sekha, the disciple in higher training, is one who has reached
any of the three lower planes of sanctity - stream-entry,
once-returning, or non-returning - but must still train further in
order to reach the goal, arahantship, the supreme security from
bondage. MN 53 is devoted to expounding the training he must
undertake. The arahant is sometimes described as asekha, one beyond
training, in the sense that he has completed the training in the
Noble Eightfold Path. Nm rendered sekha as “initiate” and asekha
as “adept,” which have been changed here to avoid their
“esoteric” connotations.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote22">
<P  ><A  NAME="sdendnote22sym" HREF="#sdendnote22anc">xxii</A>
It should be noted that, whereas the ordinary man is said to
perceive each of the bases, the one in higher training is said to
directly know them (abhijandti). MA explains that he knows them with
distinguished knowledge, knows them in accordance with their real
nature as impermanent, suffering, and non-self. Nm rendered:</P>
<P >“From earth he has direct knowledge
of earth.”</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote23">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote23sym" HREF="#sdendnote23anc">xxiii</A>
The disciple in higher training is urged by the Buddha to refrain
from conceiving and delight because the dispositions to these mental
processes still remain within him. With his attainment of
stream-entry he eradicated the fetter of personality view and thus
can no longer conceive in terms of wrong views. But the defilements
of craving and conceit are only uprooted by the path of arahantship,
and thus the sekha remains vulnerable to the conceivings to which
they are capable of giving rise. Whereas direct knowledge (abhinna)
is the province of both the sekha and the arahant, full
understanding (parinna) is the province exclusively of the arahant,
as it involves the full abandoning of all defilements.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote25">

When ignorance has been abolished by the attainment of full
understanding, the subtlest dispositions to craving and conceit are
also eradicated. Thus the arahant can no longer engage in conceiving
and delight.</P>

This section and the following two are stated to show that the
arahant does not conceive, not only because he has fully understood
the object, but because he has eradicated the three unwholesome
roots - lust (or greed), hate, and delusion. The phrase “free from
lust through the destruction of lust” is used to stress that the
arahant is not merely temporarily without lust, but has destroyed it
at the most fundamental level. Similarly with hate and delusion.</P>

On this word, the epithet the Buddha uses most often when referring
to himself, see the Introduction, p. 24. The commentaries give a
long detailed etymology, into which they try to compress virtually
the entire Dhamma. The passage has been translated in Bhikkhu Bodhi,
Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views, pp. 331-44.</P>

Parinnatantam tathagatassa. So BBS and SBJ eds. and MA, though PTS
ed. reads simply parinnatam. MA glosses: “fully understood to the
conclusion, fully understood to the limit, fully understood without
remainder.” It explains that while Buddhas and disciple-arahants
are alike in abandoning all defilements, there is a distinction in
their range of full understanding: whereas disciples can attain
Nibbana after comprehending with insight only a limited number of
formations, Buddhas fully understand all formations without
exception.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote29">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote29sym" HREF="#sdendnote29anc">xxix</A>
This sentence gives a highly compressed statement of the formula of
dependent origination (paticca samuppada), usually expounded in
twelve factors (as in MN 38). As interpreted by MA, “delight” is
the craving of the previous life that brought into being the
“suffering” of the five aggregates in the present life, “being”
the kammically determinative aspect of the present life that causes
future birth, followed by future ageing and death. This passage
shows the cause for the Buddha’s elimination of conceiving to be
his penetration of dependent origination on the night of his
enlightenment. The mention of “delight” (nandi) as the root of
suffering links up with the sutta’s title; moreover, by referring
to the earlier statement that the ordinary person delights in earth,
etc., it shows suffering to be the ultimate consequence of delight.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote30">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote30sym" HREF="#sdendnote30anc">xxx</A>
MA explains the sequence of ideas thus: The Tathagata does not
conceive earth and does not delight in earth because he has
understood that delight is the root of,suffering. Further, by
understanding dependent origination, he has completely abandoned the
craving here called “delight” and has awakened to supreme full
enlightenment. As a result he does not conceive earth or delight in
earth.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote31">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote31sym" HREF="#sdendnote31anc">xxxi</A>
The bhikkhus did not delight in the Buddha’s words, apparently
because the discourse probed too deeply into the tender regions of
their own conceit, and perhaps their residual brahmanic views. At a
later time, MA tells us, when their pride had been humbled, the
Buddha expounded to these same bhikkhus the Gotamaka Sutta (AN
3:123/i.276), in the course of which they all attained arahantship.</P>

Sabbasava Sutta – All the Taints</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The taints (asava), a
category of defilements existing at the deepest and most fundamental
level, are discussed in the Introduction, p. 38. MA explains that
restraint (samvara) is fivefold: through virtue, mindfulness,
knowledge, energy, and patience. In the present sutta, restraint
through virtue is illustrated by avoiding unsuitable seats and
resorts (§19); restraint through mindfulness, by restraining the
sense faculties (§12); restraint through knowledge, by the repeated
phrase “reflecting wisely”; restraint through energy, by the
removing of unwholesome thoughts (§20); and restraint through
patience, by the passage on enduring (§18).</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote33">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote33sym" HREF="#sdendnote33anc">xxxiii</A>
Wise attention (yoniso manasikara) is glossed as attention that is
the right means (upaya), on the right track (patha). It is explained
as mental advertence, consideration, or preoccupation that accords
with the truth, namely, attention to the impermanent as impermanent,
etc. Unwise attention (ayoniso manasikara) is attention that is the
wrong means, on the wrong track (uppatha), contrary to the truth,
namely, attention to the impermanent as permanent, the painful as
pleasurable, what is not self as self, and what is foul as
beautiful. Unwise attention, MA informs us, is at the root of the
round of existence, for it causes ignorance and craving to increase;
wise attention is at the root of liberation from the round, since it
leads to the development of the Noble Eightfold Path. MA sums up the
point of this passage thus: the destruction of the taints is for one
who knows how to arouse wise attention and who sees to it that
unwise attention does not arise.</P>

The word “seeing” (dassana) here refers to the first of the four
supramundane paths - the path of stream-entry (sotapattimagga) - so
designated because it offers the first glimpse of Nibbana. The
higher three paths are called the paths of development (bhavana)
because they develop the vision of Nibbana to the point at which all
defilements are eradicated.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote36">
<P  ><A  NAME="sdendnote36sym" HREF="#sdendnote36anc">xxxvi</A>
MA makes the important point that there is no fixed determination in
things themselves as to whether they are fit or unfit for attention.
The distinction consists, rather, in the mode of attention. That
mode of attention that is a causal basis for unwholesome states of
mind should be avoided, while that mode of attention that is a
causal basis for wholesome states should be developed. This same
principle applies to §9.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote37">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote37sym" HREF="#sdendnote37anc">xxxvii</A>
MA illustrates the growth of the taints through unwise attention as
follows: When he attends to gratification in the five cords of
sensual pleasure, the taint of sensual desire arises and increases;
when he attends to gratification in the exalted states (the jhanas),
the taint of being arises and increases; and when he attends to any
mundane things through the four “perversions” (of permanence,
etc. - see n.5), the taint of ignorance arises and increases.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote38">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote38sym" HREF="#sdendnote38anc">xxxviii</A>
According to MA, this passage is undertaken to show the taint of
views (ditthasava, not expressly mentioned in the discourse) under
the heading of doubt. However, it might be more correct to say that
the taint of views, disclosed by §8, emerges out of unwise
attention in the form of doubt. The various types of doubt are
already pregnant with the wrong views that will come to explicit
expression in the next section.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote39">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote39sym" HREF="#sdendnote39anc">xxxix</A>
Of these six views, the first two represent the simple antinomy of
eternalism and annihilationism; the view that “no self exists for
me” is not the non-self doctrine of the Buddha, but the
materialist view that identifies the individual with the body and
thus holds that there is no personal continuity beyond death. The
next three views may be understood to arise out of the
philosophically more sophisticated observation that experience has a
builtin reflexive structure that allows for self-consciousness, the
capacity of the mind to become cognizant of itself, its contents,
and the body with which it is inter-connected. Engaged in a search
for his “true nature,” the untaught ordinary person will
identify self either with both aspects of the experience (view 3),
or with the observer alone (view 4), or with the observed alone
(view 5). The last view is a full-blown version of eternalism in
which all reservations have been discarded.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote40">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote40sym" HREF="#sdendnote40anc">xl</A>
The self as speaker represents the conception of the self as the
agent of action; the self as feeler, the conception of the self as
the passive subject. “Here and there” suggests the self as the
transmigrating entity that retains its identity through a succession
of different incarnations. The same view is maintained by the
bhikkhu Sati at MN 38.2.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote41">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote41sym" HREF="#sdendnote41anc">xli</A>
This is, of course, the formula for the Four Noble Truths, treated
as a subject of contemplation and insight. MA says that up to the
attainment of the path of streamentry, attention denotes insight
(vipassana), but at the moment of the path it denotes
path-knowledge. Insight directly apprehends the first two truths,
since its objective range is the mental and material phenomena
comprised under dukkha and its origin; it can know the latter two
truths only inferentially. Path-knowledge makes the truth of
cessation its object, apprehending it by penetration as object
(arammana). Path-knowledge performs four functions regarding the
four truths: it fully understands the truth of suffering, abandons
the origin of suffering, realises the cessation of suffering, and
develops the way to the cessation of suffering.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote42">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote42sym" HREF="#sdendnote42anc">xlii</A>
The path of stream-entry has the function of cutting off the first
three fetters binding to saxnsara. MA says that personality view and
adherence to rules and observances, being included in the taint of
views, are taints as well as fetters, while doubt is (ordinarily)
classified as only a fetter, not a taint; but because it is included
here among the “taints to be abandoned by seeing,” it may be
spoken of as a taint.</P>

If abandonment of the taints is understood in the strict sense as
their ultimate destruction, then only two of the seven methods
mentioned in the sutta effect their abandonment - seeing and
development - which between them comprise the four supramundane
paths. The other five methods cannot directly accomplish the
destruction of the taints, but they can keep them under control
during the preparatory stages of practice and thereby facilitate
their eventual eradication by the supramundane paths.</P>

The primary factor responsible for exercising this restraint over
the sense faculties is mindfulness. A fuller formula for sense
restraint is given in many other suttas - e.g., MN 27.15 - and

These are the seven enlightenment factors (satta bojjhanga) included
among the thirty-seven requisites of enlightenment, and treated more
extensively below at MN 10.42 and MN 118.29-40. The present section
explains the seven enlightenment factors specifically as aids for
developing the three higher supramundane paths, by which the taints
that escaped eradication by the first path will be eradicated. The
terms “seclusion” (viveka), “dispassion” (viraga), and
“cessation” (nirodha) may all be understood as referring to
Nibbana. Their use in this context signifies that the development of
the enlightenment factors is directed to Nibbana as its goal during
the preparatory stages of the path, and as its object with the
attainment of the supramundane paths. MA explains that the word
vossagga, rendered as “relinquishment,” has the two meanings of
“giving up” (pariccaga), i.e., the abandonment of defilements,
and “entering into” (pakkhandana), i.e., culminating in Nibbana.</P>

The ten fetters that must be destroyed to gain full deliverance have
been enumerated in the Introduction, pp. 42-43. Conceit, at the most
subtle level, is the conceit “I am,” which lingers in the mental
continuum until the attainment of arahantship. The “penetration of
conceit” (manabhisamaya) means seeing through conceit and
abandoning it, which are both accomplished simultaneously by the
path of arahantship. The bhikkhu has “made an end of suffering”
in the sense that he has put an end to the suffering of the round of
sariisara (vattadukkha).</P>

And Horner: “These people emulate the views of the honoured

much better sense in this context to read dittha not as a sandhi
form of ditthi, but as the past participle, and to take this phrase
as meaning “following what they have seen of him,” i.e., his

Buddhism, is divided into three seasons - the cold season, the hot
season, and the rainy season - each lasting for four months. The
four months are subdivided into eight fortnights (pakkha), the third
and the seventh containing fourteen days and the others fifteen
days. Within each fortnight, the nights of the full moon and the new
moon (either the fourteenth or fifteenth) and the night of the
half-moon (the eighth) are regarded as especially auspicious. Within
Buddhism these days become the Uposatha, the days of religious
observance. On the full moon and new moon days the bhikkhus recite

This is the stock canonical announcement of final knowledge or
arahantship. MA explains that the statement “Birth is destroyed”
means that any type of birth that might have arisen if the path had
not been developed has been rendered incapable of arising by the
development of the path. The “holy life” that has been lived is
the holy life of the path (maggabrahmacariya). The phrase “what
had to be done has been done” (katarim karantyam) indicates that
the four tasks of the noble path - fully understanding suffering,
abandoning its origin, realising its cessation, and developing the
path - have now all been completed for each of the four supramundane
paths. The fourth phrase, napararii itthattaya, is glossed by MA
thus:</P>
<P  >“Now
there is no need for me to develop the path again for ‘such a
state,’ i.e., for the sixteenfold function (of the path) or for
the destruction of the defilements. Or alternatively: after ‘such
a state,’ i.e., the continuum of aggregates now occurring, there
is no further continuum of aggregates for me. These five aggregates,
having been fully understood, stand like trees that are cut at the
root. With the cessation of the last consciousness, they will be
extinguished like a fire without fuel.” I have opted for the
second of these interpretations, but take itthattaya as a dative.
The word, which literally means “the state of this” or “the
state of thus,” implies manifestation in a concrete state of
existence. Nm had rendered: “There is no more of this beyond.”</P>

Anangana Sutta – Without Blemishes</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> MA, picking up on the
venerable Sariputta’s use of the word “person” (puggala),
explains that the Buddha has a twofold teaching - a conventional
teaching (sammutidesana) expressed in terms of persons, beings,
women, and men, etc.; and an ultimate teaching (paramatthadesana)
expressed solely in terms that possess ultimate ontological
validity, such as aggregates, elements, sense bases, impermanent,
suffering, not self, etc. The Buddha expounds his teaching through
whichever approach is best suited to enable the hearer to penetrate
the meaning, dispel delusion, and achieve distinction. The use of
the word “person,” therefore, does not imply a misconception of
the person as a self.</P>

The possessive pronouns qualifying heart are not in the Pali, but
the sense of the phrase has to be understood by consideration of the
simile. Just as Samiti planed the faults out of the felloe as if he
knew Panduputta’s heart with his own heart, so does Sariputta
plane out the faults of the bhikkhus as if he knew Moggallana’s
wish to have them removed. MLS (1:40) misses the point by

taking the first reference to be to the monks rather than to Ven.

MA says that the expression sampannasTla, translated here as
“possessed of virtue,” can mean either “perfect in virtue”
(paripunnasila) or “endowed with virtue” (sTlasamangino). The
Patimokkha is the code of monastic discipline, which in its Pali
version consists of 227 rules. “Resort” (gocara) implies a
proper resort for alms, though it may also signify the proper
deportment of a monk, his serene and self-possessed bearing. The key
terms in this passage are analysed at Vsm I, 43-52.</P>

fulfilling the precepts signifies the training in higher virtue
(adhistlasikkha); the phrase “be devoted to internal serenity of
mind, not neglect meditation” indicates the training in
concentration or the higher mind (adhicittasikkha); and the phrase
“be possessed of insight” points to the training in the higher
wisdom (adhipannasikkha). The phrase “dwell in empty huts”
combines the latter two trainings, since one resorts to an empty hut
to develop serenity and insight.</P>

from ignorance. The former is normally the result of serenity, the
latter the result of insight. But when they are coupled and
described as taintless (anasava), they jointly result from the
destruction of the taints by the supramundane path of arahantship.</P>

MA says that the abandoning spoken of here should be understood as
“abandonment by eradication” (samucchedappahana), that is,
complete uprooting by the supramundane path. The sixteen defilements

<P  >1.
The path of stream-entry abandons: contempt, a domineering attitude,
envy, avarice, deceit, fraud.</P>

negligence.</P>
<P  >3.
The path of arahantship abandons: covetousness and nrighteous greed,
obstinacy, presumption, conceit, arrogance, vanity.</P>
<P >MA maintains, by reference to an
ancient exegetical source, that in this passage the path of the

elaborate doctrines about a self discussed in MN 102. Views
associated with doctrines about the world (lokavadapatisarhyutta)
are the eight views: the world is eternal, non-eternal, both, or
neither; the world is infinite, finite, both, or neither. See MN 63
and MN 72 for the Buddha’s rejection of these views.</P>

MA: This question refers to one who has only reached the initial
stages of insight meditation without attaining stream-entry. The
type of abandonment under discussion is abandoning by eradication,
which is effected only by the path of stream-entry. Ven. Maha Cunda
posed this question because some meditators were overestimating
their achievement, thinking they had abandoned such views while they
had not really eradicated them.</P>

MA explains that the word “arise” (uppajjanti) refers here to
the arising of views that have not arisen before; “underlie”
(anusenti) to their gathering strength through continued adherence
to them; and being “exercised” (samudacaranti) to their gaining
bodily or verbal expression. The “object” upon which they are
based is the five aggregates (khandha) that constitute a person or
living being - material form, feeling, perception, mental
formations, and consciousness.</P>

stream-entry.</P>

MA explains that the Buddha, having answered the Elder’s question,
now speaks of another type of overestimater - those who attain the
eight meditative attainments and believe that they are practising
true effacement (sallekha). The word sallekha, originally meaning
austerity or ascetic practice, is used by the Buddha to signify the
radical effacing or removal of defilements. Though the eight
attainments are elsewhere placed securely within the Buddhist
training (see MN 25.12-19, MN 26.34-41), it is here said that they
should not be called effacement because the bhikkhu who attains them
does not use</P>
<P >them as a basis for insight - as
described for example in MN 52 and MN 64 - but only as a means of
enjoying bliss and peace.</P>

The Pali term rendered by “extinguished” is parinibbuto, which

by “help extinguish” is parinibbapessati, which can also mean
“help attain Nibbana” or “bring to Nibbana.” The Pali
original for the expression to follow, “by which to extinguish
it,” parinibbanaya, might have been rendered “for attaining
Nibbana.” Though in all three cases the alternative rendering

Sammaditthi Sutta – Right View</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> MA: Right view is twofold:
mundane and supramundane. Mundane right view is again twofold: the
view that kamma produces its fruits, which may be held both by
Buddhists and outsiders, and the view that accords with the Four
Noble Truths, which is exclusive to the Buddha’s Dispensation.
Supramundane right view is the understanding of the Four Noble
Truths attained by penetrating to the four paths and fruits of
sanctity. The question posed by the Ven. Sariputta concerns the
sekha, the disciple in higher training, who possesses supramundane
right view leading irreversibly to emancipation. This is implied by
the phrase “perfect confidence” and “arrived at this true
Dhamma.”</P>

MA explains the disciple’s understanding of these four terms by
way of the Four Noble Truths thus: all the courses of action are the
truth of suffering; the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the
truth of the origin; the nonoccurrence of both actions and their
roots is the truth of cessation; and the noble path that realises
cessation is the truth of the path. To this extent a noble disciple
at one of the first three stages has been described - one who has
arrived at supramundane right view but has not yet eliminated all
defilements.</P>

The passage from “he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to
lust” until “he makes an end of suffering” shows the work
accomplished by the paths of the nonreturner and of arahantship -
the elimination of the most subtle and obstinate defilements and the
achievement of final knowledge. Here, the underlying tendencies to
sensual lust and aversion are eliminated by the path of the
non-returner, the underlying tendency to the view and conceit “I
am” and ignorance by the path of arahantship. MA explains that the
expression “underlying tendency to the view and conceit I
am’“(asmi ti ditthimananusaya) should be interpreted to mean the
underlying tendency to conceit that is similar to a view because,
like the view of self, it occurs apprehending the notion “I am.”</P>

Nutriment (ahara) is to be understood here in a broad sense as a
prominent condition for the individual lifecontinuity. Physical food
(kabalinkara ahara) is an important condition for the physical body,
contact for feeling, mental volition for consciousness, and
consciousness for mentality-materiality, the psychophysical organism
in its totality. Craving is called the origin of nutriment in that
the craving of the previous existence is the source of the present
individuality with its dependence upon and continual consumption of
the four nutriments in this existence. For an annotated compilation

the preceding existence. Since this is so, the conclusion follows
that no first point can be discovered for ignorance, and thus that
sarimsara is without discernible beginning.</P>

Satipatthana Sutta – The Foundation of Mindfulness</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> This is one of the most
important suttas in the Pali Canon, containing the most
comprehensive statement of the most direct way to the attainment of
the Buddhist goal. Virtually the identical sutta is found as well at
DN 22, though with an expanded analysis of the Four Noble Truths
attached, which accounts for its greater length. The sutta, its
commentary, and copious extracts from its difficult but illuminating
subcommentary have been presented together in translation by Soma
Thera in The Way of Mindfulness. A very readable translation of the
sutta, with a modern commentary excelling in clarity and depth, will
be found in Nyanaponika Thera, The Heart of Buddhist Meditation.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote135">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote135sym" HREF="#sdendnote135anc">cxxxv</A>
The Pali reads ekayano ayam bhikkhave maggo, and virtually all
translators understand this as a statement upholding satipatthana as
an exclusive path. Thus Ven. Soma renders it: “This is the only
way, 0 bhikkhus,” and Ven. Nyanaponika: “This is the sole way,
monks.” Nm, however, points out that ekayana magga at MN 12.37-42
has the unambiguous contextual meaning of “a path that goes in one
way only,” and so he rendered the phrase in this passage, too. The
expression used here, “the direct path,” is an attempt to
preserve this meaning in a more streamlined phrasing. MA explains
ekayana magga as a single path, not a divided path; as a way that
has to be walked by oneself alone, without a companion; and as a way
that goes to one goal, Nibbana. Though there is neither canonical
nor commentarial basis for this view, it might be maintained that
satipatthana is called ekayana magga, the direct path, to
distinguish it from the approach to meditative attainment that
proceeds through the jhanas or brahmaviharas. While the latter can
lead to Nibbana, they do not do so necessarily but can lead to
sidetracks, whereas satipatthana leads invariably to the final goal.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote136">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote136sym" HREF="#sdendnote136anc">cxxxvi</A>
The word satipatthana is a compound term. The first part, sati,
originally meant “memory,” but in Pali Buddhist usage it far
more frequently bears the meaning of attentiveness directed to the
present - hence the makeshift rendering “mindfulness.” The
second part is explained in two ways: either as a shortened form of
upatthana, meaning “setting up” or “establishing” - here, of
mindfulness; or as patthana, meaning “domain” or “foundation”
- again, of mindfulness. Thus the four satipatthanas may be
understood as either the four ways of setting up mindfulness or as
the four objective domains of mindfulness, to be amplified in the
rest of the sutta. The former seems to be the etymologically correct
derivation (confirmed by the Sanskrit sm, tyupasthana), but the Pali
commentators, while admitting both explanations, have a predilection
for the latter.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote137">

<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote138sym" HREF="#sdendnote138anc">cxxxviii</A>
The repetition in the phrase “contemplating the body as a body”
(kaye kayanupassi), according to MA, has the purpose of precisely
determining the object of contemplation and of isolating that object
from others with which it might be confused. Thus, in this practice,
the body should be contemplated as such, and not one’s feelings,
ideas, and emotions concerning it. The phrase also means that the
body should be contemplated simply as a body and not as a man, a
woman, a self, or a living being. Similar considerations apply to
the repetitions in the case of each of the other three foundations
of mindfulness. “Covetousness and grief,” MA says, stands for
sensual desire and ill will, the principal hindrances that must be
overcome for the practice to succeed, enumerated separately below in
§36.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote139">
<P  ><A  NAME="sdendnote139sym" HREF="#sdendnote139anc">cxxxix</A>
The structure of this sutta is fairly simple. Following the
preamble, the body of the discourse falls into four parts by way of
the four foundations of mindfulness:</P>
<P  >I.
Contemplation of the body, which comprises fourteen exercises:
mindfulness of breathing; contemplation of the four postures; full
awareness; attention to foulness; attention to the elements; and
nine “charnel ground contemplations” - reflection on corpses in
different stages of decomposition.</P>
<P  >II.
Contemplation of feeling, considered one exercise.</P>
<P  >III.
Contemplation of mind, also one exercise.</P>
<P  >IV.
Contemplation of mind-objects, which has five subdivisions - the
five hindrances; the five aggregates; the six sense bases; the seven
enlightenment factors; and the Four Noble Truths.</P>
<P  >Thus
the sutta expounds altogether twenty-one exercises in contemplation.
Each exercise in turn has two aspects: the basic exercise, explained
first, and a supplementary section on insight (essentially the same
for all the exercises), which indicates how the contemplation is to
be developed to deepen understanding of the phenomenon under
investigation.</P>
<P >Finally the sutta concludes with a
statement of assurance in which the Buddha personally vouches for
the effectiveness of the method by declaring the fruits of
continuous practice to be either arahantship or non-returning.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote140">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote140sym" HREF="#sdendnote140anc">cxl</A>
The practice of mindfulness of breathing (anapanasati) involves no
deliberate attempt to regulate the breath, as in hatha yoga, but a
sustained effort to fix awareness on the breath as it moves in and
out in its natural rhythm. Mindfulness is set up at the nostrils or
the upper lip, wherever the impact of the breath is felt most
distinctly; the length of the breath is noted but not consciously
controlled. The complete development of this meditation method is
expounded in MN 118. For an organised collection of texts on this
subject, see Bhikkhu Nanamoli, Mindfulness of Breathing. See too Vsm
VIII, 145-244.</P>

The “bodily formation” (kayasankhara) is defined at MN 44.13 as

“Externally”: contemplating the breathing occurring in the body
of another. “Internally and externally”: contemplating the
breathing in his own body and in the body of another alternately,
with uninterrupted attention. A similar explanation applies to the
refrain that follows each of the other sections, except that under
the contemplation of feeling, mind, and mind-objects, the
contemplation externally, apart from those possessing telepathic
powers, must be inferential.</P>

conditions on account of which the body has arisen - namely,
ignorance, craving, kamma, and food - together with the concrete
fact of the moment-bymoment origination of material phenomena in the
body. In the case of mindfulness of breathing, an additional arising
factor mentioned by the commentaries is the physiological apparatus
of respiration. The “vanishing factors” (vayadhamma) for the

Sampajanna, also translated as “clear comprehension” (Soma,

not abandoning the subject of meditation during one’s daily
routine; and full awareness of reality, the knowledge that behind
one’s activities there is no abiding self. See The Way of

Mind (citta) as an object of contemplation refers to the general
state and level of consciousness. Since consciousness itself, in its
own nature, is the bare knowing or cognizing of an object, the
quality of any state of mind is determined by its associated mental
factors, such as lust, hate, and delusion or their opposites, as

The paired examples of citta given in this passage contrast states
of mind of wholesome and unwholesome, or developed and undeveloped
character. An exception, however, is the pair “contracted” and
“distracted,” which are both unwholesome, the former due to
sloth and torpor, the latter due to restlessness and remorse. MA
explains “exalted mind” and “unsurpassed mind” as the mind
pertaining to the level of the jhanas and immaterial meditative
attainments, and “unexalted mind” and “surpassed mind” as
the mind pertaining to the level of sense-sphere consciousness.
“Liberated mind” must be understood as a mind temporarily and
partly freed from defilements through insight or the jhanas. Since
the practice of satipatthana pertains to the preliminary phase of
the path aimed at the supramundane paths of deliverance, this last
category should not be understood as a mind liberated through
attainment of the supramundane paths.</P>

The five hindrances (pancanivarana) are the main inner impediments
to the development of concentration and insight. Sensual desire
arises through attending unwisely to a sensually attractive object
and is abandoned by meditation on a foul object (as in §10 and

repugnant object and is abandoned by developing loving-kindness;
sloth and torpor arise by submitting to boredom and laziness and are
abandoned by arousing energy; restlessness and remorse arise through
unwisely reflecting on disturbing thoughts and are abandoned by
wisely reflecting on tranquillity; doubt arises through unwisely
reflecting on dubious matters and is abandoned by study,
investigation, and inquiry. The hindrances are fully eradicated only

The Pali idiom, n’eva kamupadanam upadiyati, would have to be
rendered literally as “he does not cling to the clinging to sense
pleasures,” which may obscure the sense rather than convey it.
Upadana in Pali is the object of its own verb form, while “clinging”
in English is not. At one stage in his translation Nm tried to
circumvent this problem by borrowing the word upadana’s other
meaning of “fuel” and translating: “he no longer clings to
sensual desires [as fuel for] clinging.” This, however, also
borders on obscurity, and I have therefore attempted to cut through
the difficulty by translating directly in accordance with the sense
rather than in conformity with the literal idiom.</P>

not eradicate them. MA says that he had the mistaken notion that
greed, hate, and delusion are eradicated by the path of the
once-returner. Thus, when he saw that they still arose in his mind,
he realised that they were not abandoned and inquired from the
Buddha the cause for their arising. Noble disciples can be mistaken

The “rapture and pleasure that are apart from sensual pleasures”

The Niganthas or Jains, followers of the teacher Nigantha Nataputta

wear off the accumulations of past evil kamma. The purpose of this

The interpretation of this cryptic passage hinges on the word
papanca and the compound papanca-sauna-sankha. Nm had translated the
former as “diversification” and the latter as “calculations
about perceptions of diversification.” It seems, however, that the
primary problem to which the term papanca points is not
“diversification,” which may be quite in place when the sensory
field itself displays diversity, but the propensity of the
worldling’s imagination to erupt in an effusion of mental
commentary that obscures the bare data of cognition. In a penerative
study, Concept and Reality in Early Buddhism, Bhikkhu Nanananda
explains papanca as “conceptual proliferation,” and I follow him
in substituting “proliferation” for Nm’s “diversification.”
The commentaries identify the springs of this proliferation as the
three factors - craving, conceit, and views - on account of which
the mind “embellishes” experience by interpreting it in terms of
“mine,” “I” and “my self.” Papanca is thus closely akin
to the mannana, “conceiving,” of MN 1 - see n.6.</P>
<P  >The
compound papanca-sauna-sankha is more problematic. Ven. Nanananda
interprets it to mean “concepts characterised by the mind’s
prolific tendency,” but this explanation still leaves the word
sauna out of account. MA glosses sankha by kotthasa, “portion,”
and says that sauna is either perception associated with papanca or
papanca itself. I go along with Ven. Nanananda in taking sankha to
mean concept or notion (Nm’s “calculation” is too literal)
rather than portion. My decision to treat sauna-sankha as a dvanda
compound, “perceptions and notions,” may be questioned, but as
the expression papanca-sanna-sankha occurs but rarely in the Canon
and is never verbally analysed, no rendering is utterly beyond
doubt. On alternative interpretations of its components, the
expression might have been rendered “notions [arisen from] the
proliferation of perceptions” or “perceptual notions [arisen
from] proliferation.”</P>
<P >The sequel will make it clear that the
process of cognition is itself “the source through which
perceptions and notions tinged by mental proliferation beset a man.”
If nothing in the process of cognition is found to delight in, to
welcome, or to hold to, the underlying tendencies of the defilements
will come to an end.</P>

This passage shows how papanca, emerging from the process of
cognition, gives rise to perceptions and notions that overwhelm and
victimise their hapless creator. Ms contains a note by Nm: “The
meeting of eye, form, and eye-consciousness is called contact.
Contact, according to dependent origination, is the principal
condition of feeling. Feeling and perception are inseparable (MN
43.9). What is perceived as ‘this’ is thought about in its
differences and is thus diversified from ‘that’ and from ‘me.’
This diversification - involving craving for form, wrong view about
permanence of form, etc., and the conceit ‘I am’ - leads to
preoccupation with calculating the desirability of past and present
forms with a view to obtaining desirable forms in the future.”
Perhaps the key to the interpretation of this passage is Ven. Maha
Kaccana’s explanation of the Bhaddekaratta verses in MN 133. There
too delight in the elements of cognition plays a prominent role in
causing bondage, and the elaboration of the verses in terms of the
three periods of time links up with the reference to the three times
in this sutta.</P>

arise directed towards living beings, the “other sign” is the
meditation on loving-kindness; when they are directed to inanimate
things, the “other sign” is attention to the elements (see MN

Dhamma pi vo pahatabba pageva adhamma. MA identifies the good states
with serenity and insight (samatha-vipassana), and paraphrases the
meaning: “I teach, bhikkhus, even the abandoning of desire and
attachment to such peaceful and sublime states as serenity and
insight, how much more so to that low, vulgar, contemptible, coarse,
and impure thing that this foolish Arittha sees as harmless when he
says that there is no obstruction in desire and lust for the five
cords of sensual pleasure.” The commentator cites MN 66.26-33 as
an example of the Buddha teaching the abandonment of attachment to
serenity, MN 38.14 as an example of his teaching the abandonment of
attachment to insight. Note that it is in each case the attachment
to the good states that should be abandoned, not the good states
themselves. The Buddha’s injunction is not an invitation to moral
nihilism or a proposal that the enlightened person has gone beyond
good and evil. In this connection see MN 76.51.</P>

This section evidently has the purpose of forestalling another type
of misconception and misrepresentation of the Dhamma, i.e., the
introduction of a view of self into the teaching. According to MA,
standpoints for views (ditthitthana) are wrong views themselves as
grounds for other more elaborate wrong views; the objects of views,
i.e., the five aggregates; and the conditions for views, i.e., such
factors as ignorance, perverted perception, and false thoughts, etc.</P>

This is a full-fledged eternalist view arisen on the basis of one of

identity of the self with the universe, though this interpretation

According to the commentaries, disenchantment (nibbida, also

stages of insight, dispassion (viraga) the attainment of the

“Thus gone” is, in Pali, tathagata, the usual epithet of the
Buddha, but here applied more broadly to the arahant. MA interprets
this passage in two alternative ways thus: (1) The arahant even
while alive is here and now untraceable as a being or individual (in
the sense of an abiding self) because in the ultimate sense there is
no being (as self). (2) The arahant is untraceable here and now
because it is impossible for the gods, etc., to find the support for
his insight-mind, path-mind, or fruition-mind (vipassanacitta,
maggacitta, phalacitta); that is, the object being Nibbana, his mind

The import of this statement is deeper than appears on the surface.
In the context of the false accusations of §37, the Buddha is
stating that he teaches that a living being is not a self but a mere
conglomeration of factors, material and mental events, linked
together in a process that is inherently dukkha, and that Nibbana,
the cessation of suffering, is not the annihilation of a being but
the termination of that same unsatisfactory process. This statement
should be read in conjunction with SN 12:15/ii.17, where the Buddha
says that one with right view, who has discarded all doctrines of a
self, sees that whatever arises is only dukkha arising, and whatever
ceases is only dukkha ceasing.</P>

These are two classes of individuals standing on the path of
stream-entry. “Dhamma-followers” (dhammanusarin) are disciples
in whom the faculty of wisdom (pannindriya) is predominant and who
develop the noble path with wisdom in the lead; when they attain the
fruit they are called “attained-to-view” (ditthipatta).
“Faith-followers” (saddhanusarin) are disciples in whom the
faculty of faith (saddhindriya) is predominant and who develop the
noble path with faith in the lead; when they attain the fruit they
are called “liberated-by-faith” (saddhavimutta). See MN

MA says that this refers to persons devoted to the practice of
insight meditation who have not reached any supramundane attainment.
Note that they are headed only for heaven, not for enlightenment,
though if their practice matures they can attain the path of
stream-entry and thus gain assurance of enlightenment. The
expression saddhamattath pemamattarn might be rendered “simply
faith, simply love” or “mere faith, mere love” (as it
sometimes is), but this could not explain the guarantee of rebirth
in heaven. It therefore seems obligatory to take the suffix matta
here as implying a requisite amount of faith and love, not simple
possession of these qualities.</P>

Although these seven purifications (satta visuddhi) are mentioned
elsewhere in the Pali Canon (at DN iii.288, with two added:
purification by wisdom and purification by deliverance), it is
curious that they are not analysed as a set anywhere in the Nikayas;
and this becomes even more puzzling when both these great disciples
seem to recognise them as a fixed group of doctrinal categories. The
sevenfold scheme forms, however, the scaffolding for the entire
Visuddhimagga, which defines the different stages by means of the
fully developed commentarial traditions on concentration and insight
meditation.</P>
<P >In brief, “purification of virtue”
(silavisuddhi) is the unbroken adherence to the moral precepts one
has undertaken, explained by Vsm with reference to the moral
training of a bhikkhu as the “fourfold purification of virtue.”
“Purification of mind” (cittavisuddhi) is the overcoming of the
five hindrances through the attainment of access concentration and
the jhanas. “Purification of view” (ditthivisuddhi) is the
understanding that defines the nature of the five aggregates
constituting a living being. “Purification by overcoming doubt”
(kankhavitaranavisuddhi) is the understanding of conditionality.
“Purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what
is not the path” (maggamaggananadassanavisuddhi) is the correct
discrimination between the false path of the ecstatic, exhilarating
experiences and the true path of insight into impermanence,
suffering, and not self. “Purification by knowledge and vision of
the way” (patipadananadassanavisuddhi) comprises the ascend ing
series of insight knowledges up to the supramundane paths. And
“purification by knowledge and vision” (nanadassanavisuddhi) is
the supramundane paths.</P>

Nibbana that has no condition,” explaining that upadana has two
meanings: grasping (gahana), as in the usual passage on the four
types of clinging; and condition (paccaya), as illustrated by this
passage. The commentators explain “final Nibbana without clinging”
either as the fruit of arahantship, because it cannot be grasped by
any of the four types of clinging; or as Nibbana the unconditioned,
because it has not arisen through any condition.</P>

Upadhi: The root meaning is foundation, basis, ground (PED). In the
commentaries various kinds of upadhi are enumerated, among them the
five aggregates, objects of sensual pleasure, defilements, and
kamma. Nm renders the term consistently throughout as “essentials
of existence,” which often obscures its clear contextual meaning.
I have tried to capture the several connotations of the word by
rendering it “objects of attachment” where its objective meaning
is prominent (as it is here) and as “attachment” where its
subjective meaning is prominent. At MN 26.19 Nibbana is called “the
relinquishing of all attachments” (sabb’upadhipatinissagga),
with both mean ings intended.</P>

That is, it leads to rebirth in the plane of existence called the

aeons, but when that has elapsed one must pass away and return to a
lower world. Thus one who attains this is still not free from birth

Both Horner in MLS and Nm in Ms err in their translations of the
account of the Bodhisatta’s meeting with Uddaka Ramaputta by
assuming that Uddaka is identical with Rama. However, as his name
indicates, Uddaka was the son (putta) of Rama, either biological or
spiritual. Rama himself must have already passed away before the
Bodhisatta arrived on the scene. It should be noted that all
references to Rama are in the past tense and the third person, and
that Uddaka in the end places the Bodhisatta in the position of
teacher. Though the text does not allow for definite conclusions,
this suggests that he himself had not yet reached the fourth
immaterial attainment.</P>

Alaya. It is difficult to find for this word a suitable English
equivalent that has not already been assigned to a more frequently
occurring Pali term. Horner renders it as “sensual pleasure,”
which appropriates the usual rendering of kama and may be too
narrow. In Ms and in other published works Nm translates it as
“something to rely on,” which may draw upon a connotation of the
word that is not the one intended here. MA explains alaya as
comprising both objective sense pleasures and the thoughts of
craving concerned with them; thus “worldliness” has been chosen

MA raises the question why, when the Bodhisatta had long ago made an
aspiration to reach Buddhahood in order to liberate others, his mind
now inclined towards inaction. The reason, the commentator says, is
that only now, after reaching enlightenment, did he become fully
cognizant of the strength of the defilements in people’s minds and
of the profundity of the Dhamma. Also, he wanted Brahma to entreat
him to teach so that beings who venerated Brahma would recognise the

Sariputta first enumerates the Four Noble Truths (§2). He then
takes up the truth of suffering for analysis into its various
aspects (§3). From among these, he selects the last and enumerates
the five aggregates affected by clinging (§4). He next selects the
first aggregate, that of material form (§5). Taking up each of the
great elements in turn, he shows it as having two aspects - internal
and external - the former being selected for detailed analysis, the
latter only briefly mentioned for the sake of completeness and
comparison (e.g., §§6-7). Each of the elements is expounded as a
basis for insight meditation as well as for developing patience,
faith, and equanimity (e.g., §§8-10). Having finished examining
the elements, Ven. Sariputta next takes up the aspects of the Four
Noble Truths he earlier had put aside. He introduces derivative
material form by way of the sense faculties and their objects (§27,
etc.), then he relates this to the other four aggregates of the
first noble truth, and finally he sets this whole complex of ideas
in relation to the other three noble truths (§28, etc.).</P>

Upadinna, “clung-to,” is used in the Abhidhamma as a technical
term applicable to bodily phenomena that are produced by kamma.
Here, however, it is used in a more general sense as applicable to
the entire body insofar as it is grasped as “mine” and
misapprehended as a self. The phrase “whatever else” is intended
to include the earth element comprised in those parts of the body
not included in the above enumeration. According to the Abhidhamma
analysis of matter, the four primary elements are inseparable, and
thus each element is also included, though in a subordinate role, in
the bodily phenomena listed under the other three elements.</P>

MA explains that this passage, referring to a bhikkhu who practises
meditation on the elements, is intended to show his strength of mind
in applying his comprehension of things to undesirable objects
arisen at the “door” of the ear. By contemplating the experience
by way of conditionality and impermanence, he transforms the
potentially provocative situation of being subjected to abuse into
an opportunity for insight.</P>

Tassa dhata.rammanam eva cittarh pakkhandati. This sentence can be
construed in two alternative ways, depending on how the compound
dhatarammanam is understood. Ven. Nyanaponika takes it as the object
of the verb pakkhandati, and he understands dhatu here as “an
impersonal element in general” capable of including sound,
contact, feeling, etc. Thus he translates: “And his mind enters
into that very object [taking it just as an impersonal] element.”
Nm reads the compound as an adjunct qualifying citta, and supplies
the object of the verb in parenthesis. MA seems to support the
former reading; MT explicitly identifies dhatu as the earth element,
thus supporting the latter reading. MA explains the phrase “acquires
decision” to mean that the meditator contemplates the situation by
way of elements and thus has neither attachment nor aversion
concerning it.</P>

the virtues of the bhikkhu who can endure such abuse without giving
rise to a mind of hate. “Equanimity supported by the wholesome”
(upekkha kusalanissita) is the equanimity of insight, the sixfold
equanimity of neither attraction nor aversion towards agreeable and
disagreeable objects that appear at the six sense doors. Strictly

This section is set forth, according to MA, to introduce the
material form derived from the four great elements. Derived material
form, according to the Abhidhamma analysis of matter, includes the
five sense faculties (pasadarupa) and the first four kinds of sense
object, the tangible object being identified with the primary
elements themselves. “Corresponding (conscious) engagement”
(tajjo samannaharo) is explained by MA as attention (manasikara)
arising in dependence on the eye and forms; it is identified with
the “five-door adverting consciousness”
(pancadvaravajjanacitta), which breaks off the flow of the life
continuum (bhavanga) to initiate a process of cognition. Even when
forms come into range of the eye, if attention is not engaged by the
form because one is occupied with something else, there is still no
manifestation of the “corresponding class of consciousness,”

word “Abhidhamma” occurs in the Sutta Pitakas of several early
recensions, the Japanese Pali scholar Fumimaro Watanabe concludes
that the Buddha’s own disciples formed the conception of
Abhidhamma as an elementary philosophical study that attempted to

wished to dedicate the merit to the Licchavis. But the Buddha
replies that the Licchavis will gain the merit of providing Saccaka

Because he does not see the Buddhist bhikkhus engaged in

“development of mind” concentration. When the noble disciple
experiences pleasant feeling, he does not become overwhelmed by it

escape from it by entering into one of the meditative absorptions.</P>

MA explains this passage as follows: “Everything” (sabbe dhamma)
is the five aggregates, the twelve bases, the eighteen elements.
These are “not worth adhering to” by way of craving and views
because they turn out in actuality to be different from the way they
are grasped: grasped as permanent, pleasurable, and self, they turn
out to be impermanent, suffering, and not self. He “directly
knows” them as impermanent, suffering, and not self, and “fully
understands” them by scrutinising them in the same way.
“Contemplating impermanence,” etc., is accomplished by the
insight knowledges of rise and fall and of destruction and
disappearance. “He does not cling” to any formation by way of
craving and views, does not become agitated because of craving, and
personally attains Nibbana by the extinguishing of all defilements.</P>

Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta – The Greater Discourse on the Destruction
of Craving</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> According to MA, through
faulty reasoning based on the fact of rebirth, Sati came to the
conclusion that a persisting consciousness transmigrating from one
existence to another is necessary to explain rebirth. The first part
of the sutta (down to §8) replicates the opening of MN 22, the only
difference being in the view espoused.</P>

MA: The purpose of the simile is to show that there is no
transmigration of consciousness across the sense doors. Just as a
log fire burns in dependence on logs and ceases when its fuel is
finished, without transmigrating to faggots and becoming reckoned as
a faggot fire, so too, consciousness arisen in the eye door
dependent on the eye and forms ceases when its conditions are
removed, without transmigrating to the ear, etc., and becoming
reckoned as ear-consciousness, etc. Thus the Buddha says in effect:
“In the occurrence of consciousness there is not even the mere
transmigration from door to door, so how can this misguided Sati
speak of transmigration from existence to existence?”</P>

Bhutam idan ti. MA: “This” refers to the five aggregates. Having
shown the conditionality of consciousness, the Buddha states this
passage to show the conditionality of all the five aggregates, which
come into being through conditions, their “nutriment,” and pass
out of being with the ceasing of those conditions. In the following
tadaharasambhavam, MA takes the tad as a nominative representing the
subject (= tam khandhapancakam), but it seems more likely that it
qualifies ahara and that both should be taken as ablatives, the
subject idam being understood. This interpretation seems confirmed
by the third statement, tadaharani.rodha yam bhutam tam
nirodhadhammam. Horner’s “This is the origination of nutriment”
is clearly wrong.</P>

This is a statement of the abstract principle of dependent

The following portion of the discourse may be understood as a

only as a doctrinal formula - to the course of individual existence.
The passage §§26-29 may be taken to show the factors from
consciousness through feeling that result from past ignorance and
formations, §40 the causal factors of craving and clinging as they
build up a continuation of the samsaric round. The following section
(§§31-40), connecting dependent origination to the appearance of
the Buddha and his teaching of the Dhamma, shows the practice of the
Dhamma to be the means of bringing the round to an end.</P>

This statement reveals that the chain of dependent origination is
broken at the link between feeling and craving. Feeling arises
necessarily because the body acquired through past craving is
subject to the maturation of past kamma. However, if one does not
delight in feeling, craving will not have the opportunity to arise
and set off reactions of like and dislike that provide further fuel
for the round, and thus the round will come to an end.

Shame (hiri) and fear of wrongdoing (ottappa) are two complementary

rebirth in the higher heavenly worlds and for the destruction of the

attainment of jhana, rebirth into the Pure Abodes (the five
beginning with the Aviha gods) the attainment of the stage of
non-returner, rebirth into the immaterial planes the corresponding
immaterial attainments, and the destruction of the taints requires
the full practice of the Noble Eightfold Path up to the path of

According to MA, the understanding of the Four Noble Truths being
discussed here is penetration by the supramundane path. Thus the
lowest type of person to be described as “one who is wise”
(pannava) is the person on the path of stream-entry. The rendering
of patina as “wisdom” (which I substituted for Nm’s
“understanding”) has the disadvantage of severing the tie,
evident in the Pali, with the verb pajanati. To preserve the

rendered “wisely understand.”</P>

The Pali phrase defining consciousness uses only the verb, vijanati
vijanati, and this could as well be understood to mean “One

MA: The question concerns the consciousness with which the person
described as “one who is wise” examines formations; that is, the
consciousness of insight by which that person arrived (at his
attainment), the mind which does the work of meditation. Ven.
Sariputta answers by explaining the meditation subject of feeling,
in the way it has come down in the Discourse on the Foundations of
Mindfulness (MN 10.32). The Pali construction, sukhan ti pi
vijanati, indicates that the feeling is being treated as a direct
object of consciousness rather than as an affective tone of the
experience; to show this the words “this is” have been supplied

MA interprets the phrase “maker of signs” (nimitta karana) to

MA explains the compound panc’upadanakkhandha as the five
aggregates that become the condition for clinging (MT: as its
objects). Since these five aggregates are, in brief, the entire
noble truth of suffering (MN 9.15; 28.3), it will be seen that the
first four questions pose an inquiry into the Four Noble Truths
expressed in terms of personality rather than suffering.</P>

These are the twenty kinds of personality view. MA quotes Pts
1.144-45 to illustrate the four basic modes of personality view in
regard to material form. One may regard material form as self, in
the way the flame of a burning oil-lamp is identical with the colour
(of the flame). Or one may regard self as possessing material form,
as a tree possesses a shadow; or one may regard material form as in
self, as the scent is in the flower; or one may regard self as in
material form, as a jewel is in a casket.</P>

The four foundations of mindfulness are the basis of concentration

MA: Dhammadinna anticipated Visakha’s intention to ask about the
formations that cease when one enters the attainment of cessation.

MA explains further that the bodily formation and the mental
formation are said to be formations “bound up” with the body and
the mind in the sense that they are formed by the body and by the
mind, while the verbal formation is a formation in the sense that it
forms speech. The verb form vitakketva vicaretva has been rendered
in a way that maintains consistency with the rendering of the nouns
vitakka and vicara as “applied thought” and “sustained
thought.”</P>

Cessation can be attained only by a non-returner or an arahant with
mastery over the eight jhanic attainments. The meditator enters each
attainment in turn, emerges from it, and contemplates it with
insight as impermanent, suffering, and not self. After completing
this procedure with the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and attending to certain
preliminaries, the meditator determines to be without mind for a
particular length of time. His determination, backed by his previous
accomplishments and preparations, leads him into the attainment of
cessation. See Vsm XXIII, 32-43.</P>

Brahmanimantanika Sutta – The Invitation of a Brahma</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The Mulapariyaya Sutta (MN
1) was also delivered by the Buddha while he was living in the
Subhaga Grove at Ukkattha, and the similarity in formulation and
theme between these two suttas - perhaps the only two recorded as
originating at Ukkattha - is striking. It is even possible to see
the present sutta as a dramatic representation of the same ideas set
forth by the Mulapariyaya in abstract philosophical terms. Thus Baka
the Brahma may be taken to represent being or personality in its
most eminent form, blindly engaged in the activity of conceiving,
sustaining itself with its delusions of permanence, pleasure, and
selfhood. Underlying being is craving, symbolised by Mara -
seemingly inconspicuous in the assembly, yet the real author of all
the outpourings of conceiving, the one who holds the entire universe
in his grip. The alliance of Brahma and Mara, God and Satan, an
incomprehensible union from the perspective of Western theism,
points to the thirst for continued being as the hidden root of all
world affirmation, whether theistic or non-theistic. In the sutta
the superficial theoretical contest between Baka and the Buddha soon
gives way to a gripping deep-level confrontation between Mara and
the Buddha - Mara as craving demanding the affirmation of being, the
Enlightened One pointing to the cessation of being through the
uprooting of delight.</P>

held this eternalist view with regard to both his own individual

dissolution, a being of great merit is the first to be reborn in the
newly formed Brahmaworld. Subsequently, other beings take rebirth in
the Brahma-world and this causes Maha Brahma to imagine that he is

This passage, parallel in structure to the corresponding passage of
MN 1, is a difficult one. The difficulty centres around the verb
used in the first four statements regarding earth, about which there
is not even certainty as to the correct reading. Nm prefers the BBS
ed. reading apahosim, which he takes to be an aorist of pabhavati,
meaning “to produce, to give being to.” MA glosses: “I did not
grasp earth through the obsessions of craving, conceit, and views.”
Nm had rendered ananubhutam as “not co-essential with.” This has
been replaced by “not commensurate with,” following MA’s
gloss, “not reached by earth” and MT: “Its nature is not
shared in common with earth.” MA says that what is “not

These lines (which also appear as part of a full verse at DN
11.85/i.223) have been a perennial challenge to Buddhist
scholarship, and even Acariya Buddhaghosa seems to founder over
them. MA takes the subject of the sentence to be Nibbana, called
“consciousness” in the sense that “it can be cognized.” This
is obviously a contrived derivation, since nowhere in the Canon is
Nibbana ever described as consciousness. MA offers three
explanations of the phrase sabbato pabham: (1) completely possessed
of splendour (pabha); (2) possessing being (pabhutam) everywhere;
and (3) a ford (pabham) accessible from all sides, i.e., through any
of the thirty-eight meditation objects. Only the first of these
seems to have any linguistic legitimacy. Nm, in Ms, explains that he
takes pabham to be a negative present participle of pabhavati -
apabham - the negative-prefix a dropping off in conjunction with
sabbato: “The sense can be paraphrased freely by ‘not
predicating being in relation to “all,’“or ‘not assuming of
“all” that it is or is not in an absolute sense.’“</P>

The Buddha’s disappearance seems to be a “visible”
demonstration of his verse. Having extirpated delight in being, he
is able to vanish from the sight of Baka, the supreme representative
of being and world affirmation. But Baka, bound to being by
clinging, cannot transcend the range of the Buddha’s knowledge,
which encompasses both being and non-being at the same time that it
transcends them.</P>

Rather, Mara caused the brahmins to imagine scenes of the bhikkhus

This passage states clearly and explicitly the regulations on

that the Buddha does not require the bhikkhus to observe a
vegetarian diet, but permits them to consume meat when they are
confident that the animal has not been slaughtered especially to
provide them with food. Such meat is called tikotiparisuddha, “pure
in three aspects,” because it is not seen, heard, or suspected to
come from an animal killed specifically for the bhikkhu. The lay
Buddhist’s precept of abstaining from the taking of life would
prohibit him from killing for his food, but does not proscribe
purchasing meat prepared from animals already dead. For more on this

Danda, originally a stick or staff, acquires the meaning of rod as
an instrument of punishment, and subsequently comes to mean
punishment or infliction itself, even without reference to an

the individual torments himself by prolonging his bondage in

The Buddha may have said this because in his teaching volition
(cetana), a mental factor, is the essential ingredient of kamma, and
in its absence - that is, in the case of unintentional bodily or
verbal activity - no kamma is created. MA, however, maintains that
the Buddha said this referring to wrong view with fixed consequences
(niyata miccha ditthi), and it quotes in support AN 1:18.3/i.33:
“Bhikkhus, I see nothing so blameworthy as wrong view. Wrong view
is the most blameworthy of all things.” These types of wrong view

evil.” Though the statement conveys a concern for moral purity,

The three views discussed in §§5, 13 and 21 are called wrong views
with fixed evil result (niyata miccha ditthi). To adhere to them

</P>
<P  >The
examination of these views unfolds according to the following
pattern: The Buddha discloses the wrong view A and its antithesis B.
Taking up A for examination first, in A.i he shows the pernicious
effect of this view on bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. In A.ii
he proceeds from the judgement that the view is actually wrong and
elicits additional negative consequences of its adoption.</P>
<P  >Then
in A.iii he shows how a wise person comes to the conclusion that
whether or not the view is true, it serves his best interest to
reject it.</P>
<P  >Next,
position B is considered. In B.i the Buddha describes the wholesome
influence of this view on conduct. In B.ii he elicits additional
positive consequences of adopting such a view. And in B.iii he shows

This doctrine of non-doing (akiriyavada), in the Samannaphala Sutta
(DN 2.17/i.52-53), is attributed to Purana Kassapa. Although on
first encounter the view seems to rest on materialist premises, as
the previous nihilistic view does, there is canonical evidence that
Purana Kassapa subscribed to a fatalistic doctrine. Thus his moral
antinomianism probably follows from the view that all action is
predestined in ways that abrogate the ascription of moral
responsibility to its agent. See Basham, History and Doctrines of

MA: The question may be raised: “When the Buddha had asked about
the fetters and the Elder replied in terms of the fetters, why does
the Buddha criticise his reply?” The reason is that Malunkyaputta
held the view that a person is fettered by the defilements only at
times when they assail him, while at other times he is not fettered
by them. The Buddha spoke as he did to show the error in this view.</P>

Anuseti tvev’assa sakkayaditthanusayo. On the anusayas or
underlying tendencies, see n.473. In the commentaries the
defilements are distinguished as occurring at three levels: the
anusaya level, where they remain as mere latent dispositions in the
mind; the pariyutthana level, where they rise up to obsess and
enslave the mind (referred to in §5 of this discourse); and the
vitikkama level, where they motivate unwholesome bodily and verbal
action. The point of the Buddha’s criticism is that the fetters,
even when they do not come to active manifestation, continue to
exist at the anusaya level so long as they have not been eradicated
by the supramundane path.</P>

This passage shows the development of insight (vipassana) upon a
basis of serenity (samatha), using the jhana on which the practice
of insight is based as the object of insight contemplation. See MN
52.4 and n.552. Here two terms - impermanent and disintegrating -
show the characteristic of impermanence; three terms - alien, void,
and not self - show the characteristic of non-self; the remaining

characteristics. The “deathless element” (amata dhatu) is
Nibbana. First “he directs his mind to it” with the insight
consciousness, having heard it praised and described as “the
peaceful and sublime,” etc. Then, with the supramundane path, “he
directs his mind to it” by making it an object and penetrating it
as the peaceful and sublime, etc.</P>

mind; another emphasises wisdom - he is said to gain deliverance by
wisdom. Among those who proceed by way of insight, one emphasises
wisdom - he is said to gain deliverance by wisdom; another
emphasises unification of mind - he is said to gain deliverance of
mind. The two chief disciples attained arahantship by emphasising
both serenity and insight, but Ven. Sariputta became one who gained
deliverance by wisdom and Ven. Maha Moggallana became one who gained
deliverance of mind. Thus the reason (for the different
designations) is the difference in their faculties, i.e., between
the predominance of the concentration faculty and of the wisdom
faculty.</P>

Both Nm and Horner take sankameyya here to mean that the bhikkhu
makes himself a plank, i.e., lies down across the mud. This,
however, is contradicted by Bhaddali’s negative answer. Thus it

over himself (as the verb literally does mean), in disregard of the

Latukikopama Sutta – The Simile of the Quail</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> From this passage and that
to follow, it appears that the Buddha restricted the allowable time
for bhikkhus’ meals in two successive stages, first prohibiting
only the afternoon meal and allowing a night meal. However, in the
Vinaya account of the origin of Pac 37 (Vin iv.85) no mention is
made of this successive prohibition. To the contrary, the text seems
to assume that it is an item of common knowledge that monks should
not consume food past noon, and it shows the Buddha laying down the
rule against untimely eating with one complete pronouncement valid
for all meals past noon.</P>

sensual pleasures; as pavivekasukha because they yield the bliss of
being secluded from the crowd and from defilements; as upasamasukha

MA explains that even though part of the statement is valid, the
Buddha rejects the entire statement because of the portion that is
invalid. The part of the statement that is valid is the assertion
that the Buddha is omniscient and all-seeing; the part that is
excessive is the assertion that knowledge and vision are
continuously present to him. According to the Theravada tradition
the Buddha is omniscient in the sense that all knowable things are
potentially accessible to him. He cannot, however, know everything
simultaneously and must advert to whatever he wishes to know. At MN
90.8 the Buddha says that it is possible to know and see all, though
not simultaneously, and at AN 4:24/ii.24 he claims to know all that
can be seen, heard, sensed, and cognized, which is understood by the
Theravada tradition as an assertion of omniscience in the qualified
sense. See too in this connection Miln 102-7.</P>

land, ornaments, wealth, grain, etc. MA says that even though the
texts mention some individuals who attained arahantship as laymen,
by the path of arahantship they destroyed all attachment to worldly
things and thus either went forth as monks or passed away
immediately after their attainment. The question of lay arahants is
discussed at Miln 264.</P>

Aggivacchagotta Sutta – To Vacchagotta on Fire</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The view that the soul
(jiva) and the body are the same is materialism, which reduces the
soul to the body. The following view that the soul and the body are

The view that a Tathagata exists after death is a form of eternalism
that regards the Tathagata, or spiritually perfect individual, as
possessing a self that attains eternal deliverance after the death
of the body. The view that a Tathagata does not exist after death
also identifies the Tathagata as self, but holds that this self is
annihilated upon the death of the body. The third view attempts a
synthesis of these two, which the Buddha rejects because both
components involve a wrong view. The fourth view seems to be a
sceptical attempt to reject both alternatives or to avoid taking a
definite stand.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote720">

In the Pali a word play is involved between ditthigata, “speculative

This passage should be connected with the simile of the extinguished

gone to any direction, so the Tathagata who has attained to final
Nibbana cannot be described in terms of the four alternatives. The

usage and is not intended to suggest, as some scholars have held,
that the Tathagata attains to some mystical absorption in the
Absolute. The words “profound, immeasurable, unfathomable” point
to the transcendental dimension of the liberation attained by the
Accomplished One, its inaccessibility to discursive thought.</P>

Dighanakha Sutta – To Dighanakha</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> Dighanakha was Ven.
Sariputta’s nephew. At the time he approached the Buddha,
Sariputta had been a bhikkhu for only two weeks and was still a
stream-enterer.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote731">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote731sym" HREF="#sdendnote731anc">dccxxxi</A>
MA holds that Dighanakha is an annihilationist (ucchedavadin) and
explains this assertion to mean: “No [mode of] rebirth is
acceptable to me.” However, the text itself does not give any
concrete evidence supporting this interpretation. It seems much more
likely that Dighanakha’s statement, “Nothing is acceptable to
me” (sabbam me na khamati), is intended to apply specifically to
other philosophical views, and thus shows Dighanakha to be a radical
sceptic of the class satirically characterised at MN 76.30 as
“eel-wrigglers”. His assertion would then be tantamount to a
wholesale repudiation of all philosophical views.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote732">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote732sym" HREF="#sdendnote732anc">dccxxxii</A>
This exchange, as interpreted by MA and MT, should be understood as
follows: The Buddha suggests, by his question, that Dighanakha’s
assertion involves an inherent contradiction. For he cannot reject
everything without also rejecting his own view, and this would
entail the opposite position, namely, that something is acceptable
to him. However, though Dighanakha recognises the implication of the
Buddha’s question, he continues to insist on his view that nothing
is acceptable to him.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote733">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote733sym" HREF="#sdendnote733anc">dccxxxiii</A>
MA says that the first sentence refers to those who first take up a
basic eternalist or annihilationist view and then subsequently adopt
secondary variations on that view; the second sentence refers to
those who abandon their basic view without adopting an alternative.
But if, as seems plausible, Dighanakha was a radical sceptic, then
the Buddha’s statement might be understood to point to an
unsatisfactoriness inherent in the sceptic’s position: it is
psychologically uncomfortable to insist on remaining in the dark.
Thus most sceptics, while professing a rejection of all views,
surreptitiously adopt some definite view, while a few abandon their
scepticism to seek a path to personal knowledge.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote734">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote734sym" HREF="#sdendnote734anc">dccxxxiv</A>
MA identifies the three views here as eternalism, annihilationism,
and partial eternalism. The eternalist view is close to lust
(saragaya santike), etc., because it affirms and delights in
existence in however sublimated a form; annihilationism is close to
non-lust, etc., because, though involving a wrong conception of
self, it leads to disenchantment with existence. If the second view
is understood as radical scepticism, it could also be seen as close
to non-lust in that it expresses disillusionment with the attempt to
buttress the attachment to existence with a theoretical foundation
and thus represents a tentative, though mistaken, step in the
direction of dispassion.</P>

their proponents - inconsistently with their own principles - did
observe celibacy and practise austerities. The “four kinds of holy

In the Samannaphala Sutta the view that follows, as far as “the

(DN 2.26/i.56). However, in that sutta the following passage on the
elaborate system of classifications, down to “fools and the wise
both will make an end of suffering,” is connected with the view of
non-causality and follows immediately upon the statement of the
doctrine of non-causality set forth in this sutta at §13. The
entire view is there assigned to Makkhali Gosala. Since there are
evident connections between the non-causality doctrine and items in
the system of classifications (e.g., the reference to the “six
classes”), and since both are known to have been typical of the
AjIvaka movement headed by Makkhali Gosala, it seems that the
inclusion of this system of classifications here under the doctrine
of the seven bodies came about through an error of oral
transmission. The correct version would thus be the one preserved by
the Digha Nikaya. For the commentary on the system of

second is the attainment of the jhanas using a kasina derived from

but the sign of concentration (nimitta) arises externally. The
“transcending” of the forms is the attainment of absorption
together with the arising of the sign. The perception “I know, I
see” is the advertence (abhoga) that occurs after he emerges from
the attainment, not within the attainment. The second base of

Precepts). MA will also explain the subsequent passages by reference
to the other supramundane paths and fruits. Although the text of the
sutta does not expressly mention these attainments, the commentarial
interpretation seems to be justified by the expression “cease
without remainder” (aparisesa nirujjhanti), for it is only with
the attainment of the respective paths and fruits that a total
cessation of the particular defilement occurs. The commentary’s
view is further supported by the culmination of the entire discourse
in the figure of the arahant.</P>

Evariivanno atta hoti arogo param marana. The word arogo, normally
meaning healthy, here should be understood to mean permanent. MA
says that he speaks with reference to rebirth in the heavenly world

Previous translators seem to have been perplexed by the verb
anassama. Thus Nm in Ms renders the line: “We don’t renounce our
teachers’ doctrines for this reason.” And Horner: “We have
heard to here from our own teachers.” But anassama is a
first-person plural aorist of nassati, “to perish, to be lost.”
The same form occurs at MN 27.7. MA explains that they knew that in
the past meditators would do the preparatory work on the kasina,
attain the third jhana, and be reborn in the world of Refulgent
Glory. But as time went on, the preparatory work on the kasina was
no longer understood and meditators were not able to attain the
third jhana. The wanderers only learned that “an entirely pleasant
world” exists and that the five qualities mentioned at §21 were
the “practical way” to it. They knew of no entirely pleasant
world higher than the third jhana, and of no practical way higher
than the five qualities.</P>

that by reason of past evil kamma, he and his wife were destined to

down a disciplinary rule prohibiting the bhikkhus from stepping on a
white cloth, but subsequently modified the rule to allow bhikkhus to
step on a cloth as a blessing for householders.</P>

is an epithet meaning “garland (mala) of fingers (anguli).” He
was the son of the brahmin Bhaggava, a chaplain to King Pasenadi of
Kosala. His given name was Ahimsaka, meaning “harmless one.” He
studied at Takkasila, where he became his teacher’s favourite. His
fellow students, jealous of him, told the teacher that Ahimsaka had
committed adultery with his wife. The teacher, intent on bringing
Ahimsaka to ruin, commanded him to bring him a thousand human
righthand fingers as an honorarium. Ahimsaka lived in the Jalini
forest, attacking travellers, cutting off a finger of each, and
wearing them as a garland around his neck. At the time the sutta
opens he was one short of a thousand and had made a determination to
kill the next person to come along. The Buddha saw that Angulimala’s
mother was on her way to visit him, and aware that Angulimala had
the supporting conditions for arahantship, he intercepted him

experienced in any life subsequent to the next, as long as one’s
sojourn in samsara continues. Because he had attained arahantship,
Angulimala had escaped the latter two types of result but not the
first, since even arahants are susceptible to experiencing the
present-life results of actions they performed before attaining
arahantship.</P>

MA’s explanation of this reply suggests that the former class of
gods are non-returners, while the latter class are gods who have not
attained the status of non-returners. The same would apply to the
question on Brahmas in §15. The two key terms that here distinguish
the two types of gods appear in the PTS ed. as savyapajjha and
abyapajjha, which would be rendered as “subject to ill will” and
“free from ill will,” respectively. The BBS ed. reading accepted
here, sabyabajjha and abyabajjha, has the support of MA, which
glosses the former as “who have not abandoned mental suffering by
eradicating it,” and the latter as “who have eradicated
suffering.” As either reading would be applicable to
non-returners, no significant difference is entailed. Note that the
word itthatta, which in the stock declaration of arahantship
signifies any state of manifest existence, is here glossed by MA as
manussaloka, the human world.</P>

Brahmayu Sutta - Brahmayu</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> This is a stock
description of a learned brahmin. According to MA, the Three Vedas
are the Iru, Yaju, and Sama (= Rig, Yajur, and Saman). The fourth
Veda, the Atharva, is not mentioned, but MA says its existence is
implied when the histories (Itihasa) are called “the fifth,”
i.e., of the works regarded as authoritative by the brahmins. It is
more likely, however, that the histories are called “the fifth”
in connection with the four branches of study auxiliary to the Vedas
that precede them in the description. The translation of technical
terms here follows MA, with the help of Monier-William’s
SanskritEnglish Dictionary (Oxford, 1899). On the marks of a Great
Man, MA says that this was a science based on 12,000 works
explaining the characteristics of great men, such as Buddhas,
paccekabuddhas, chief disciples, great disciples, Wheel-turning
Monarchs, etc. These works included 16,000 verses called “The
Buddha Mantra.”</P>

MA explains limiting action (pamanakatam kammarh) as kamma
pertaining to the sense sphere (kamavacara). It is contrasted with a
limitless or immeasurable action, namely, the jhanas pertaining to
the fine-material sphere or the immaterial sphere, In this case the
brahmaviharas developed to the jhanic level are intended. When a
jhana pertaining to the fine-material sphere or the immaterial
sphere is attained and mastered, a kamma pertaining to the sense
sphere cannot overpower it and gain the opportunity to yield its own
result. Rather, the kamma pertaining to the fine-material sphere or
the immaterial sphere overpowers the sense-sphere kammas and
produces its results. Obstructing the result of the sense-sphere
kammas, the brahmavihara that has been mastered leads to rebirth in
the company of Brahma.</P>

MA explains the source of suffering to be craving, so called because
it is the root of the suffering comprised in the five aggregates.
The passage shows two alternative approaches toward overcoming
craving - one employing energetic striving, the other detached
equanimity. The “fading away” of the source is identified by MA
with the supramundane path. The passage is said to illustrate the

In the Brahmajala Sutta sixteen varieties of this view are
mentioned, the eight given here and two other tetrads: the self as
finite, infinite, both, and neither; and the self as experiencing
exclusively pleasure, exclusively pain, a mixture of both, and
neither. In the present sutta these two tetrads are incorporated
under speculations about the past in §14.</P>

<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote938sym" HREF="#sdendnote938anc">cmxxxviii</A>
Evidently, in the above list the views of the self as immaterial,
percipient of unity, and percipient of the immeasurable are based on
attainment of the base of infinite space. MT explains the
consciousness-kasina as the base of infinite consciousness, stating
that these theorists declare that base to be the self.</P>

The perception within the third immaterial meditation - the base of
nothingness - is the subtlest and most refined of all mundane
perceptions. Although there is still a kind of perception in the
fourth immaterial attainment, it is so subtle that it is considered
no longer appropriate to designate it perception.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote940">

MA paraphrases thus: “All those types of perceptions together with
the views are conditioned, and because they are conditioned, they
are gross. But there is Nibbana, called the cessation of formations,
that is, of the conditioned. Having known ‘There is this,’ that
there is Nibbana, seeing the escape from the conditioned, the
Tathagata has gone beyond the conditioned.”</P>

MA explains the compound ditthasutamutavinnatabba as meaning “what

refer to sense-door cognitions. However, it can also comprise all
grosser mind-door cognitions as well. To enter the fourth immaterial
attainment, all the ordinary “mental formations” involved in
other cognitive processes must be overcome, for their persistence is
an obstacle to entering this attainment. Hence it is called “not
percipient” (n’eva sanni).</P>

The “fear and disgust with personality” is an aspect of

So far only four of the original five classes of speculations about
the future have been analysed, yet the Buddha speaks as if they were
all explicated. MA tries to resolve the problem by explaining that
assertions of “Nibbana here and now” were comprised by the terms
“percipient of unity” and “percipient of diversity” in §3.
This explanation, however, is not convincing. Nm, in Ms, had added
the heading “Nibbana Here and Now” over §17, and §§17-21 do
seem to correspond with the last four of the five doctrines of
Nibbana here and now in the Brahmajala. However, this interpretation
seems contradicted by §13 and by the phrase used in §17, §19 and
§21, “with the relinquishing of views about the past and the
future,” which would exclude the doctrines of Nibbana here and
now. The problem seems insoluble, and raises the question whether a
passage on Nibbana here and now was not lost in the course of the
sutta’s oral transmission. In the Brahmajala the five doctrines
are the assertion of sensual pleasures and the four jhanas to be the
self’s attainment of supreme Nibbana here and now.</P>

An offence involving defeat, a parajika offence, requires expulsion

Any offence of the two classes, parajika and sanghadisesa; see
n.987. The analogy is difficult to apply with complete precision,
since if craving and ignorance had truly been removed from him with
only a trace left behind, the bhikkhu would be a sekha; yet it is
inconceivable that a sekha would abandon the training or commit a
defiled offence. It seems that in this case the analogy must be
applied loosely, and the bhikkhu should be understood as one who
falsely imagines that craving and ignorance have been removed from
him.</P>

MA explains the phrase “his mind acquires confidence in this base”
to mean that he attains either insight aimed at reaching arahantship
or the access to the fourth jhana. If he gains access to the fourth
jhana, this becomes his basis for attaining “the imperturbable,”
i.e., the fourth jhana itself. But if he gains insight, then he
decides upon perfecting wisdom by deepening his insight in order to
reach arahantship. The decision “to perfect wisdom” may explain
why so many of the following sections of this sutta, though
culminating in attainments along the scale of concentration, are
expressed in phrasing appropriate to the development of insight.</P>

MA explains that this passage describes the rebirth process of one
who could not realise arahantship after reaching the fourth jhana.
The “consciousness leading [to rebirth]” (sarhvattanikam
vinnanam) is the resultant consciousness by which this person is
reborn, and this has the same imperturbable nature as the kammically
formative consciousness that attained to the fourth jhana. Since it
is the fourth-jhana consciousness that determines rebirth, this
person will be reborn in one of the celestial realms corresponding
to the fourth jhana.</P>

reborn in the plane of infinite space.</P>

MA calls this two-pointed voidness - the absence of “I” and

is expounded by way of insight rather than concentration, the
approach taken in the previous section. At MN 43.33, this
contemplation is said to lead to the deliverance of mind through
voidness.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1016">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1016sym" HREF="#sdendnote1016anc">mxvi</A>
MA calls this four-pointed voidness and explains thus: (i) he does
not see his self anywhere; (ii) he does not see a self of his own
that can be treated as something belonging to another, e.g., as a
brother, friend, assistant, etc.; (iii) he does not see the self of
another; (iv) he does not see the self of another that can be
treated as something belonging to him. Ms has a note by Nm: “These
expressions [in this paragraph and the next] seem to have been
stereotyped slogans or descriptions of the attainments of
nothingness and neither-perception-nor-non-perception, primarily
non-Buddhist, and sometimes used as a basis for the existing-body

the five aggregates. The first part of the formula again seems to be

dividing the last item into two - one’s own body with its

context suggests that the absence of conceit may be the meaning. The
statement “for in whatever way they conceive, the fact is ever
other than that” (yena yena hi mannanti tato tam hoti annatha) is
a philosophical riddle appearing also at Sri 588, Sri 757, and Ud
3:10. Though MA is silent, the Udana commentary explains it to mean
that in whatever way worldly people conceive any of the five
aggregates - as self or self’s belonging, etc. - the thing
conceived turns out to be other than the aspect ascribed to it: it
is not self or self’s belonging, not “I” or “mine.”</P>

Bahudhatuka Sutta – The Many Kinds of Elements</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The eighteen elements are
defined at Vbh §§183-84/ 87-90 and are explained in detail at Vsm
XV, 17-43. Briefly, the mind element (manodhatu), according to the
Abhidhamma, includes the consciousness that adverts to the five
sense objects impinging on the five sense faculties
(pancadvaravajjana-citta) and the consciousness that receives the
object after it has been cognized through the senses
(sampaticchana-citta). The mind-consciousness element
(manovinnanadhatu) includes all types of consciousness except the
five sense consciousnesses and the mindelement. The mind-object
element (dhammadhatu) includes the types of subtle material
phenomena not involved in sense cognition, the three mental
aggregates of feeling, perception, and formations, and Nibbana. It
does not include concepts, abstract ideas, judgements, etc. Though
these latter are included in the notion of mind-object
(dhammarammana), the mind-object element includes only things that
exist by their own nature, not things constructed by the mind.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1078">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1078sym" HREF="#sdendnote1078anc">mlxxviii</A>
These are defined at Vbh §180/85-86. The pleasure and pain elements
are bodily pleasant and painful feeling; the joy and grief elements
are mental pleasant and painful feeling; the equanimity element is
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. MA says that ignorance is
brought in because of its apparent similarity to the equanimity
element.</P>

MA: A person possessing right view (ditthisampanno) is one

MA points out that a noble disciple below the level of arahantship
can still apprehend formations as pleasurable with a mind
dissociated from wrong view, but he cannot adopt the view that any
formation is pleasurable. Although perceptions and thoughts of
formations as pleasurable arise in him, he knows reflectively that
such notions are mistaken.</P>

In the passage on self, sankhara, “formation,” is replaced by
dhamma, “thing.” MA explains that this substitution is made to
include concepts, such as a kasina sign, etc., which the ordinary
person is also prone to identify as self. However, in view of the
fact that Nibbana is described as imperishable (accuta) and as bliss
(sukha), and is also liable to be misconceived as self (see MN
1.26), the word sankhara may be taken to include only the
conditioned, while dhamma includes both the conditioned and the
unconditioned. This interpretation, however, is not endorsed by the
commentaries of Acariya Buddhaghosa.</P>

Pubbangama, lit. “the forerunner.” MA says that two kinds of
right view are forerunners: the right view of insight, which
investigates formations as impermanent, suffering, and non-self; and
the right view of the path, which arises as a consequence of insight
and effects the radical destruction of defilements. The right view
of insight as the forerunner seems to be shown in §§4, 10, 16, 22

This definition defines supramundane right view as the wisdom
(panna) found among the requisites of enlightenment as a faculty,
power, enlightenment factor, and path factor. The definition is
formulated by way of the cognitive function rather than the
objective content of the view. Elsewhere (MN 141.24) the right view
of the path is defined as knowledge of the Four Noble Truths. We may
understand that the conceptual comprehension of the four truths
falls under mundane right view, while the direct penetration of the
truths by realising Nibbana with the path constitutes supramundane
right view.</P>

MA: This statement refers exclusively to the co-existent factors
accompanying supramundane right intention. In the preliminary phase
of the practice, the three mundane right intentions arise
separately, but at the moment of the supramundane path, a single
right intention arises cutting off the threefold wrong intention.
Thus the supramundane right intention may also be described as the
intention of renunciation, non-ill will, and non-cruelty. The same

“Experiencing the mind” is to be understood by way of the four
jhanas. “Gladdening the mind” is explained either as the
attainment of the two jhanas containing rapture or as the
penetration of those jhanas with insight as subject to destruction,
etc. “Concentrating the mind” refers either to the concentration
pertaining to the jhana or to the momentary concentration that
arises along with insight. “Liberating the mind” means
liberating it from hindrances and grosser jhanic factors by
successively higher levels of concentration, and from the cognitive
distortions by way of insight knowledge.</P>

This tetrad deals entirely with insight, unlike the previous three,
which deal with both serenity and insight. “Contemplating fading
away” and “contemplating cessation” can be understood both as
the insight into the impermanence of formations and as the
supramundane path realising Nibbana, called the fading away of lust
(i.e., dispassion, viraga) and the cessation of suffering.
“Contemplating relinquishment” is the giving up of defilements
through insight and the entering into Nibbana by attainment of the
path.</P>

MA: In-and-out breathing is to be counted as the air element among
the four elements making up the body. It should also be included in
the base of tangibles among bodily phenomena (since the object of

desire and ill will, and thus represent the contemplation of
mind-objects, which begins with the five hindrances. The bhikkhu
sees the abandoning of the hindrances effected by the contemplations
of impermanence, fading away, cessation, and relinquishment, and
thus comes to look upon the object with equanimity.</P>

Sankharupapatti Sutta - Reappearance by Aspiration</H5>
<P  ><SUP></SUP>
Although I have attempted to render sankhara consistently throughout
as “formations,” here it seemed that the content required a
different rendering to bring the intended meaning to light. Nm had
used “determinations,” his own consistent choice for sankhara.
MA initially explains sankharupapatti as meaning either reappearance
(i.e., rebirth) of mere formations, not of a being or person, or
reappearance of the aggregates in a new existence through a
meritorious kamma formation. However, in subsequent passages,. MA
glosses sankhara with patthana, a word unambiguously meaning
aspiration.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1133">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1133sym" HREF="#sdendnote1133anc">mcxxxiii</A>
MA: “The way” is the five qualities beginning with faith,

mind, i.e., knowing the thoughts of the beings throughout a thousand
worlds; pervasion of the kasina, i.e., extending the kasina image to
a thousand worlds; pervasion of the divine eye, i.e., seeing a
thousand worlds with the divine eye; pervasion of light, which is
the same as the previous pervasion; and pervasion of body, i.e.,
extending one’s bodily aura to a thousand worlds.</P>

MA: The five qualities mentioned are sufficient for rebirth into the
sense-sphere realm, but for the higher modes of rebirth and the
destruction of the taints, more is required. Basing oneself on the
five qualities, if one attains the jhanas, one is reborn in the
Brahma-world; if one attains the immaterial attainments, one is
reborn in the immaterial world; if one develops insight and attains
the fruit of non-returning, one is reborn in the Pure Abodes; and if

MA: This was a dwelling built in Nigrodha’s Park by Kalakhemaka

MA explains that this was merely a rhetorical question, since the
Buddhas can know by direct knowledge whatever they wish to know. The
Buddha asked this with the thought in mind: “As soon as these
bhikkhus form into a society and delight in society, they will act
in improper ways. I shall expound the Great Practice of Voidness
which will be like a training rule [prohibiting delight in

<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1151sym" HREF="#sdendnote1151anc">mcli</A>
MA: The Buddha begins the present passage in order to ward off the
criticism that while he enjoins his disciples to live in solitude,
he himself is often surrounded by a large retinue. “Voidness”
here is the fruition attainment of voidness; see n.1137.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1152">

MA explains voidness internally as that connected with one’s own
five aggregates, voidness externally as that connected with the
aggregates of others. The voidness spoken of here thus must be the
temporary deliverance of mind reached through the insight
contemplation of non-self, as explained at MN 43.33. When the
insight into non-self is brought to the level of the path, it issues
in the fruition experiencing Nibbana by way of its aspect of
voidness.</P>

MA: This refers to the jhana that was used as the basis for insight.
If, after emerging from the basic jhana, his mind does not enter
into voidness through insight contemplation on his own aggregates or
those of others, and he also cannot attain the imperturbable
immaterial attainment, he should return to the same basic jhana that
he originally developed and attend to it again and again.</P>

According to MA, up to this point the Buddha has shown the training
for the attainment of the first two paths, those of stream-entry and
once-returning. He now speaks the present passage (§§14-15) to
point out the insight needed to attain the path of non-returning,

Acariyupaddava, antevasupaddava, brahmacariyupaddava. Upaddava may
also be rendered as disaster, calamity. MA explains that the Buddha
speaks the present passage to show the danger in solitude when one
does not fulfil the proper purpose of solitary living. The “teacher”
is a teacher outside the Buddha’s Dispensation.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1158">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1158sym" HREF="#sdendnote1158anc">mclviii</A>
MA: The going forth into homelessness outside the Dispensation
brings small gain, so one who falls away from that falls away only
from mundane attainment; he meets with no great suffering, as one
who falls from the back of a donkey merely becomes covered with
dust. But the going forth in the Buddha’s Dispensation brings
great gain - the paths, fruits, and Nibbana. Thus one who falls away
from this meets great suffering, like one who falls from the back of
an elephant.</P>

The contrast in this simile is between the way the potter treats the
raw damp clay and the way he treats the baked pots produced from the
clay. MA paraphrases: “After advising once I shall not be silent;
I shall advise and instruct by repeatedly admonishing you. Just as
the potter tests the baked pots, puts aside those that are cracked,
split, or faulty, and keeps only those that pass the test, so I
shall advise and instruct by repeatedly testing you. Those among you
who are sound, having reached the paths and fruits, will stand the
test.” MA adds that the mundane virtuous qualities are also
intended as a criterion of soundness.</P>

above and beyond the multitude; his seven steps, of his acquiring
the seven enlightenment factors; the white parasol, of his acquiring
the parasol of deliverance; his surveying the quarters, of his

MA explains light (obhasa) as the preliminary light, which MT

one who gains the fourth jhana develops the light-kasina as the

(dassanam rupanath) is the seeing of forms with the divine eye. Ven.
Anuruddha was later declared by the Buddha to be the foremost

Bhaddekaratta Sutta – One Fortunate Attachment</H5>

<P  ><A  NAME="sdendnote1210sym" HREF="#sdendnote1210anc">mccx</A>
Ms contains the following note by Nm on this expression, which
accounts for the title of this and the following three suttas:</P>
<P  >This
term has elsewhere been translated by “true saint” and like
phrases, which, however, quite miss the point. The commentary says
only this: “Bhaddekarattassa means ‘of one who is fortunate
(bhadda) in having one (eka) attachment (ratta or ratti)’; this is
because of his possessing application to insight.” The
subcommentary resolves the compound ekaratta (one-attachment) into
eka ratti, and says only that “bhaddekaratta means one who has a
fortunate single attachment (bhaddo ekaratto etassa); it is a term
for a person who is cultivating insight.” There appears to be no
other mention of this term elsewhere in the Canon and its
commentaries.</P>
<P  >The
Pali word ratta (adj.) or ratti (n.) in this instance is from the
root raj, “to take pleasure in.” So the “bhaddekaratta”
appears to be the one who is applying himself invincibly,
unshakeably, to know and to study the present state as it occurs
(see verse). This application of attachment is auspicious or
fortunate because it leads to liberation … It might be supposed
that the expression “bhaddekaratta” was a popular phrase taken
over by the Buddha and given a special sense by him, as was not
infrequently done, but there seems to be no reason to do so and
there is no evidence for it in this case. It is more likely to be a
term coined by the Buddha himself to describe a certain aspect of
development.</P>
<P >Ven. Nanananda, in the introduction to
his translation, offers an argument for rendering the term “the
ideal lover of solitude.” Horner renders it simply as “the
Auspicious.”</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote1211">

More literally the first two lines would be translated: “Let not a
person run back to the past or live in expectation of the future.”
The meaning will be elucidated in the expository passage of the

Asamhiram asankuppam. MA explains that this is said for the purpose
of showing insight and repeated insight; for insight is “invincible,
unshakeable” because it is not vanquished or shaken by lust and
other defilements. Elsewhere the expression “the invincible, the
unshakeable” is used as a description of Nibbana (e.g., Sn v.1149)
or of the liberated mind (e.g., Thag v.649), but here it seems to
refer to a stage in the development of insight. The recurrence of
the verb form samhtrati in §8 and §9 suggests that the intended
meaning is contemplation of the present moment without being misled
into the adoption of a personality view.</P>

MA: One “finds delight” by bringing to bear upon the past either
craving or a view associated with craving. It should be noted that
it is not the mere recollection of the past through memory that
causes bondage, but the reliving of past experiences with thoughts
of craving. In this respect the Buddha’s teaching differs
significantly from that of Krishnamurti, who seems to regard memory
itself as the villain behind the scene.</P>

Perhaps this sentence, and all the parallel sentences to follow,
should be translated: “One does not find delight there thinking,
‘I had such material form in the past.’“The translation as it
stands suggests that such thoughts arise but without the
accompaniment of delight, while the alternative proposed here
suggests that these thoughts do not arise at all. The same
alternative construction can also be applied to thoughts about the
future in §7. The Pali can admit either rendering.</P>

Culakammavibhanga Sutta – The Shorter Exposition of Action</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> See MN 99. According to
MA, his father, the Brahmin Todeyya, was reborn as a dog in his own
house because of his extreme stinginess. The Buddha identified him
to Subha by getting the dog to dig up some hidden treasure Subha’s
father had buried before his death. This inspired Subha’s
confidence in the Buddha and moved him to approach and inquire about
the workings of kamma.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdendnote1224">
<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1224sym" HREF="#sdendnote1224anc">mccxxiv</A>
If the kamma of killing directly determines the mode of rebirth, it
will produce rebirth in one of the states of deprivation. But if a
wholesome kamma brings about a human rebirth - and rebirth as a
human being is always the result of wholesome kamma - the kamma of
killing will operate in a manner contrary to that of the
rebirthgenerative kamma by causing various adversities that may
reach their peak in a premature death. The same principle holds for
the subsequent cases in which unwholesome kamma comes to maturity in
a human existence: in each case the unwholesome kamma counteracts
the wholesome kamma responsible for the human rebirth by engendering
a specific type of misfortune corresponding to its own distinctive
quality.</P>

<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1225sym" HREF="#sdendnote1225anc">mccxxv</A>

Mahakammavibhanga Sutta - The Greater Exposition of Action</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> MA says that Potaliputta
did not actually hear this personally from the Buddha, but had heard
a report that these statements were made by the Buddha. The former
is a distorted version of the Buddha’s declaration at MN 56.5 that
mental action is the most reprehensible of the three types of deeds
for the performance of evil action. The latter derives from the
Buddha’s discussion of the cessation of perception in the
Potthapada Sutta (DN 9). MA glosses the word “vain” by
“fruitless.”</P>

MA: The person who was seen with the divine eye killing living
beings, etc., is reborn in hell because of another evil deed he had
done earlier than the deed of killing, etc., or because of an evil
deed he did afterwards, or because of a wrong view he accepted at
the time of death. Although the Pali seems to be saying that he was
necessarily reborn in hell on account of some action other than the
one he was seen performing, this should not be understood as an
apodictic pronouncement but only as a statement of possibility. That
is, while it may be true that he was reborn in hell because of the
evil action he was seen performing, it is also possible that he was
reborn there because of some other evil action he did earlier or
later or because of wrong view.</P>

Buddha, having announced that he will teach a summary and an
exposition, should recite only the summary and leave without giving

he had not previously declared his intention to give an exposition.

All known editions of the Pali text of MN 138 read here anupada
paritassana, literally “agitation due to non-clinging,” which
obviously contradicts what the Buddha consistently teaches: that
agitation arises from clinging, and ceases with the removal of
clinging. However, this reading apparently precedes the time of the
commentaries, for MA accepts anupada as correct and offers the
following explanation: “In what sense is there agitation due to
non-clinging? Through the non-existence of anything to cling to. For
if there existed any formation that were permanent, stable, a self,
or the belonging of a self, it would be possible to cling to it.
Then this agitation would be agitation due to clinging (something to
cling to). But because there is no formation that can be clung to
thus, then even though material form, etc., are clung to with the
idea ‘material form is self,’ etc., they are not clung to (in
the way they are conceived). Thus, what is here called ‘agitation
due to non-clinging’ is in meaning agitation due to clinging by
way of views.” Nm had followed this reading, and on the basis of
MA’s explanation, had rendered the phrase “anguish [agitation]
due to not finding anything to cling to.” He did not discuss the
problem in his notes.</P>
<P >A sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya (SN
22:7/iii, 16) is virtually identical with this passage of MN 138,
except that here it reads, as we should expect, upada paritassana,
“agitation due to clinging.” From the Sarnyutta text we may
safely infer that the Majjhima reading is an ancient error that
should be discounted. My rendering here is based on the reading of
SN 22:7. Homer too follows the latter text in MLS.</P>

Dhatuvibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of the Elements</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> According to MA, Pukkusati
had been the king of Takkasila and had entered into a friendship
with King Bimbisara of Magadha through merchants who travelled
between the two countries for purposes of trade. In an exchange of
gifts Bimbisara sent Pukkusati a golden plate on which he had
inscribed descriptions of the Three Jewels and various aspects of
the Dhamma. When Pukkusati read the inscription, he was filled with
joy and decided to renounce the world. Without taking formal
ordination, he shaved his head, put on yellow robes, and left the
palace. He went to Rajagaha intending to meet the Buddha, who was
then in Savatthi, about 300 miles away. The Buddha saw Pukkusati
with his clairvoyant knowledge, and recognising his capacity to
attain the paths and fruits, he journeyed alone on foot to Rajagaha
to meet him. To avoid being recognised, by an act of will the Buddha
caused his special physical attributes such as the marks of a Great
Man to be concealed, and he appeared just like an ordinary wandering
monk. He arrived at the potter’s shed shortly after Pukkusati had
arrived there intending to leave for Savatthi the next day in order
to meet the Buddha.</P>

Pannadhitthana, saccadhitthana, cagadhitthana, upasamadhitthana. Nm,
in Ms, had first rendered adhitthana as “resolve,” and then
replaced it with “mode of expression,” neither of which seems
suitable for this context. MA glosses the word with patittha, which
clearly means foundation, and explains the sense of the statement
thus: “This person who consists of the six elements, the six bases
of contact, and the eighteen kinds of mental approach - when he
turns away from these and attains arahantship, the supreme
accomplishment, he does so established upon these four bases.” The
four foundations will be individually elucidated by the sequel,

cultivate the relinquishment of defilements in order to accomplish
the relinquishing of all defilements by the path of arahantship.
From the start one should train in the pacification of defilements

The sense is: If he attains the base of infinite space and should
pass away while still attached to it, he would be reborn in the
plane of infinite space and would live there for the full lifespan
of 20,000 aeons specified for that plane. In the higher three
immaterial planes the lifespan is respectively 40,000 aeons, 60,000

MA: This is said in order to show the danger in the immaterial
jhanas. By the one phrase, “This would be conditioned,” he
shows: “Even though the lifespan there is 20,000 aeons, that is
conditioned, fashioned, built up. It is thus impermanent, unstable,
not lasting, transient. It is subject to perishing, breaking up, and
dissolution; it is involved with birth, ageing, and death, grounded
upon suffering. It is not a shelter, a place of safety, a refuge.
Having passed away there as a worldling, one can still be reborn in
the four states of deprivation.”</P>

This statement does not imply that there is any inherent

The sense of this instruction might be explained with the help of MA
thus: One is dependent because of craving and views and becomes
independent by abandoning them with the attainment of arahantship.
Bias (nati, lit. bending) comes about through craving, and its
absence means there is no inclination or desire for existence. There
is no coming and going by the ending of rebirth and death, no here
nor beyond nor in between by the transcendence of this world, the
world beyond, and the passage between one and the other. This is the
end of the suffering of defilements and the suffering of the round.</P>

MA explains this instruction as a short teaching on the Four Noble
Truths. Delight (nandT) is an aspect of craving. Through the arising
of delight in regard to the eye and forms there arises the suffering
of the five aggregates. Thus in this first part of the instruction
the Buddha teaches the round of existence by way of the first two
truths - suffering and its origin - as they occur through the six
senses. In the second part (§4) he teaches the ending of the round
by way of the second two truths - cessation and the path - expressed
as the abandoning of delight in the six senses and their objects.</P>

rules laid down by the Buddha when he established the Bhikkhuni
Sangha stipulated that every fortnight the bhikkhunis should request
the bhikkhus to send a bhikkhu for the purpose of giving them an
exhortation. According to MA, in a previous life Ven. Nandaka had
been a king and those bhikkhunis had been his concubines. He wanted
to avoid his turn in advising the bhikkhunis because he thought that
another bhikkhu possessing the knowledge of past lives, seeing him
giving an exhortation surrounded by the bhikkhunis, would think that
he still could not separate himself from his former concubines. But
the Buddha saw that Nandaka’s discourse to the bhikkhunis would
benefit them and thus he requested him to instruct them.</P>

The truth of suffering is shown by the term “personality,”

respectively give rise to the notions “mine,” “I am” and “my

The eight factors of the path mentioned here seem to pertain to the
preliminary or mundane portion of the path. MT identifies them with

development, immediately prior to the emergence of the supramundane

operative, the three factors of the morality group having been
purified prior to the undertaking of insight meditation. But when

Beginning with this section a sequence of development may be
discerned. The abandoning of the five cords of sensual pleasure is
the preliminary step for developing the jhanas, and the abandoning
of the five hindrances (§10) the immediate antecedent to the
attainment of the first jhana. The full understanding of the five
aggregates (§11) indicates the insight wisdom necessary to attain
the path of stream-entry, and the sections on the thirty-seven
requisites of enlightenment (§§12-18) the cultivation of the
factors needed to arrive at the intermediate stages of sanctity. The
section on serenity and insight (§19), though applicable to all
stages, can be seen as fully actualised by the non-returner striving

Indriyabhavana Sutta - The Development of the Faculties</H5>
<P ><SUP></SUP> The expression “the
development of the faculties” (indriyabhavana) properly signifies
the development of the mind in responding to the objects experienced
through the sense faculties. The more rudimentary aspect of this
practice, the restraint of the sense faculties (indriyasathvara),
involves controlling the mind in such a way that one does not grasp
at the “signs and features” of things, their distinctive
attractive and repulsive attributes. The development of the
faculties carries this process of control through to the point
where, by an act of will, one can immediately set up insight even in
the course of sense perception. At the highest level one acquires
the ability to radically transform the subjective significance of
perceptual objects themselves, making them appear in a mode that is
the very opposite of the way they are normally apprehended.</P>

MA explains that when a desirable form comes into range of the eye,
an agreeable state (manapa) arises; when an undesirable form
appears, a disagreeable state (amanapa) arises; and when an
indifferent form appears, a state that is both agreeable and
disagreeable arises. It should be noted that though these three
terms are ordinarily used to qualify the sense objects, here they
also seem to signify subtle states of liking, aversion, and dull
indifference that arise due to the influence of the underlying
tendencies. MT identifies “the agreeable” with wholesome and
unwholesome states of mind associated with joy, “the disagreeable”
with unwholesome states of mind associated with grief (displeasure),
and “the agreeable and disagreeable” with states of mind
associated with equanimous feeling.</P>
</DIV>

<P ><A  NAME="sdendnote1354sym" HREF="#sdendnote1354anc">mcccliv</A>
MA: This equanimity is the equanimity of insight (vipassan’upekkha).
The bhikkhu does not allow his mind to be overcome by lust, hate, or
delusion, but comprehends the object and sets up insight in the
neutral state. MT explains this to mean that he enters into
equanimity regarding formations (sankhar’upekkha), a particular
stage of insight knowledge (see Vsm XXI, 61-66).</P>

Although the sekha has already entered upon the way to final

Since the arahant has eradicated all the defilements along with
their underlying tendencies, in this passage the three terms - the
agreeable, etc. - must be understood simply as the feelings that
arise through contact with sense objects, and not as the subtle
traces of liking, aversion, and indifference relevant to the
preceding passage.</P>

<DIV ID="sdendnote1360">
<P  ><A  NAME="sdendnote1360sym" HREF="#sdendnote1360anc">mccclx</A>
The Patisambhidamagga calls this practice “the noble supernormal
power” (ariya iddhi) and explains it thus (ii.212): To abide
perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive, one pervades a
repulsive being with lovingkindness, or one attends to a repulsive
object (either animate or inanimate) as a mere assemblage of
impersonal elements. To abide perceiving the repulsive in the
unrepulsive, one pervades a (sensually) attractive person with the
idea of the foulness of the body, or one attends to an attractive
object (either animate or inanimate) as impermanent. The third and
fourth methods involve the application of the first and second
contemplations to both repulsive and unrepulsive objects, without
discrimination. The fifth method involves the avoidance of joy and
sorrow in response to the six sense objects, thus enabling one to
abide in equanimity, mindful and fully aware.</P>
<P >Although this fivefold contemplation is
ascribed to the arahant as a power perfectly under his control,
elsewhere the Buddha teaches it to bhikkhus still in training as a
way to overcome the three unwholesome roots. See AN
5:144/iii.169-70; and for a thoughtful commentary on that sutta, see
Nyanaponika Thera, The Roots of Good and Evil, pp. 73-78.</P>
