On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's
Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
"Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One
said this:</P>
<P  >(SPECULATIONS
ABOUT THE FUTURE)</P>

"Bhikkhus, there are some recluses and brahmins who speculate about
the future and hold views about the future, who assert various
doctrinal propositions concerning the future.</P>

Some assert thus: 'The self is percipient and unimpaired<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote936anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote936sym"><SUP>cmxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>

Or they describe the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of
an existing being [at death].</P>
<P  >(V)
Or some assert Nibbana here and now.</P>
<P  >"Thus
(a) they either describe an existing self that is unimpaired after
death; (b) or they describe the annihilation, destruction, and
extermination of an existing being [at death]; (c) or they assert
Nibbana here and now. Thus these [views] being five become three, and
being three become five. This is the summary of the 'five and
three.'</P>
<P  >3.
(I) "Therein, bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins [229] who
describe the self as percipient and unimpaired after death describe
such a self, percipient and unimpaired after death, to be either:</P>

<P  >4.
"The Tathagata, bhikkhus, understands this thus: 'Those good
recluses and brahmins who describe the self as percipient and
unimpaired after death describe such a self to be either material ...
or they describe it to be percipient of the immeasurable. Or else,
[230] since the perception "there is nothing" is declared to be
the purest, supreme, best, and unsurpassed of those perceptions -
whether perceptions of form or of the formless, of the limited or the

- some assert the base of nothingness, immeasurable and

"Therein, bhikkhus, these criticise those recluses and brahmins who
describe the self as percipient and unimpaired after death. Why is
that? Because they say: 'Perception is a disease, perception is a

unimpaired after death, to be either material ... or neither material
nor immaterial. That any recluse or brahmin could say:</P>
<P  >"Apart
from material form, apart from feeling, apart from perception, apart
from formations, I shall describe the coming and going of
consciousness, its passing away and re-appearance, its growth,
increase, and maturation" - that is impossible.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote942anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote942sym"><SUP>cmxlii</SUP></A></SUP>

<P  >10.
"The Tathagata, bhikkhus, understands this thus: 'Those good
recluses and brahmins who describe the self as neither percipient nor
non-percipient and unimpaired after death describe such a self,
neither percipient nor non-percipient and unimpaired after death, to
be either material ... or neither material nor immaterial. If any
recluses or brahmins describe the entering upon this base to come
about through a measure of formations regarding what is seen, heard,
sensed, and cognized, that is declared to be a disaster for entering
upon this base.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote945anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote945sym"><SUP>cmxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
[232] For this base, it is declared, is not to be attained as an

recluses and brahmins who describe the self as non-percipient and

brahmins who describe the self as neither percipient nor
non-percipient and unimpaired after death. Why is that? All these
good recluses and brahmins, rushing onwards, assert their attachment
thus: 'We shall be thus after death, we shall be thus after death.'
Just as a merchant going to market thinks: 'Through this, that will
be mine; with this, I will get that'; so too, these good recluses
and brahmins seem like merchants when they declare: 'We shall be
thus after death, we shall be thus after death.'</P>

"The Tathagata, bhikkhus, understands this thus: 'Those good
