<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote867anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote867sym"><SUP>dccclxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the country of the
Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, [102] with twelve
hundred and fifty bhikkhus, and eventually he arrived at a town of
the Anguttarapans named Apana.</P>
<P  >2.
The matted-hair ascetic Keniya heard: "The recluse Gotama, the son
of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been wandering
in the country of the Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus,
with twelve hundred and fifty [103] bhikkhus, and he has come to
Apana. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this
effect ... (as Sutta 91, §3) ... Now it is good to see such
arahants."</P>
<P  >3.
Then the matted-hair ascetic Keniya went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The Blessed One
instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged him with a talk on the
Dhamma. Then, having been instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged
by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma, the matted-hair ascetic
Keniya said to the Blessed One: "Let Master Gotama together with
the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow's meal from me."</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the Blessed One told him: "The Sangha of bhikkhus is
large, Keniya, [104] consisting of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus,
and you place full confidence in the brahmins."</P>
<P  >A
second time the matted-hair ascetic Keniya said to the Blessed One:
"Although the Sangha of bhikkhus is large, Master Gotama,
consisting of twelve hundred and fifty bhikkhus, and although I place
full confidence in the brahmins, still let Master Gotama, together
with the Sangha of bhikkhus, consent to accept tomorrow's meal from
me." A second time the Blessed One told him: "The Sangha of
bhikkhus is large, Keniya ... "</P>
<P  >A
third time the matted-hair ascetic Keniya said to the Blessed One:
"Although the Sangha is large, Master Gotama ... still let Master
Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept
tomorrow's meal from me." The Blessed One consented in silence.</P>
<P  >4.
Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, the matted-hair
ascetic Keniya rose from his seat and went to his own hermitage where
he addressed his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives
thus: "Hear me, sirs, my friends and companions, my kinsmen and
relatives. The recluse Gotama has been invited by me for tomorrow's
meal together with the Sangha of bhikkhus. Make the necessary
purchases and preparations for me."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," they replied, and some dug out ovens, some chopped wood, some
washed dishes, some set out water jugs, some prepared seats, while
the matted-hair ascetic Keniya himself set up a pavilion.</P>
<P  >5.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Sela was staying at Apana. [105] He
was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy,
phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in
philology and grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and
in the marks of a Great Man, and was teaching the recitation of the
hymns to three hundred brahmin students.</P>
<P  >6.
At the time the matted-hair ascetic Keniya had placed full confidence
in the brahmin Sela. Then the brahmin Sela, while walking and
wandering for exercise attended by his three hundred brahmin
students, came to the matted-hair ascetic Kenya's hermitage. There
he saw some men digging out ovens, some chopping wood, some washing
dishes, some setting out water jugs, some preparing seats, while the
matted-hair ascetic Keniya himself was setting up a pavilion.</P>
<P  >7.
When he saw this, he asked the matted-hair ascetic Keniya: "What,
is Master Keniya to hold a marriage or a giving in marriage? Or is
there some great sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha
been invited with a large retinue for tomorrow's meal?"</P>
<P  >8.
"I will not be holding a marriage or a giving in marriage, Master
Sela, nor has King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha been invited with a
large retinue for tomorrow's meal, but I am planning a great
sacrifice. The recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth
from a Sakyan clan, has been wandering in the country of the
Anguttarapans with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with twelve hundred
and fifty bhikkhus, and has come to Apana. [106] Now a good report of
Master Gotama has been spread to this effect: 'That Blessed One is
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened [buddha], blessed.'
He has been invited by me for tomorrow's meal together with the
Sangha of bhikkhus."</P>
<P  >9.
"Did you say 'Buddha,' Keniya?"</P>
<P  >"I
said 'Buddha,' Sela."</P>
<P  >"Did
you say 'Buddha,' Keniya?"</P>
<P  >"I
said 'Buddha,' Sela."</P>
<P  >10.
Then it occurred to the brahmin Sela: "Even this word 'Buddha'
is hard to come across in this world. Now the thirtytwo marks of a
Great Man have been handed down in our hymns, and the Great Man who
is endowed with them has only two possible destinies, no other. If he
lives the home life he becomes a Wheel-turning Monarch, a righteous
king who rules by the Dhamma, master of the four quarters,
all-victorious, who has stabilised his country and possesses the
seven treasures. He has these seven treasures: the wheel-treasure,
the elephanttreasure, the horse-treasure, the jewel-treasure, the
womantreasure, the steward-treasure, and the counsellor-treasure as
the seventh. His children, who exceed a thousand, are brave and
heroic and crush the armies of others; over this earth bounded by the
ocean he rules without a rod, without a weapon, by means of the
Dhamma. But if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness, he
becomes an Accomplished One, a Fully Enlightened One, who draws aside
the veil in the world."</P>
<P  >11.
[He said]: "My good Keniya, where is Master Gotama, the
Accomplished One, the Fully Enlightened One, now living?"</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the matted-hair ascetic Keniya extended his right arm
and said: [107] "There, where that green line of the grove is,
Master Sela."</P>
<P  >12.
Then the brahmin Sela went with the three hundred Brahmin students to
the Blessed One. He addressed the brahmin students: "Come quietly,
sirs, tread carefully; for these Blessed</P>
<P  >Ones
are difficult to approach, they wander alone like lions. When I am
speaking with the recluse Gotama, do not break in and interrupt me,
but wait until our talk is finished."</P>
<P  >13.
Then the brahmin Sela went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings
with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat
down at one side and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man
on the Blessed One's body. He saw, more or less, the thirty-two
marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One's body, except two; he was
doubtful and uncertain about two of the marks, and he could not
decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being
enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue.</P>
<P  >Then
it occurred to the Blessed One: "This brahmin Sela sees the
thirty-two marks of a Great Man on me, except two; he is doubtful and
uncertain about two of the marks, and he cannot decide and make up
his mind about them: about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath
and about the largeness of the tongue."</P>
<P  >14.
Then the Blessed One worked such a feat of supernormal power that the
brahmin Sela saw that the Blessed One's male organ was enclosed in
a sheath. [108] Next the Blessed One extruded his tongue, and he
repeatedly touched both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered
the whole of his forehead with his tongue.</P>
<P  >15.
Then the brahmin Sela thought: "The recluse Gotama is endowed with
the thirty-two marks of a Great Man; they are complete, not
incomplete. But I do not know whether he is a Buddha or not. However,
I have heard from elder aged brahmins who speak according to the
lineage of teachers that those who are the Accomplished Ones, Fully
Enlightened Ones, reveal themselves as such when their praise is
spoken. Suppose I extol the recluse Gotama to his face with fitting
stanzas."</P>
<P  >Then
he extolled the Blessed One to his face with fitting stanzas:</P>
<P  >16.
Sela</P>
<P >
"0 perfect in body, well favoured,</P>
<P >
Well fashioned and lovely to behold;</P>
<P >
O Blessed One, golden is your colour,</P>
<P >
And white your teeth; you are strong.</P>
<P >
The features are seen one and all</P>
<P >
That distinguish a man as well born;</P>
<P >
They are all to be found on your body,</P>
<P >
These marks that reveal a Great Man.</P>
<P >
With eyes clear, with countenance bright,</P>
<P >
Majestic, erect as a flame, In the midst of this body of recluses</P>
<P >
You shine like the blazing sun.</P>
<P >
A bhikkhu so lovely to look on</P>
<P >
With skin of so golden a sheen –</P>
<P >
With beauty so rare why should you</P>
<P >
Be content with the life of a recluse?</P>
<P >
You are fit to be a king, a lord of chariots,</P>
<P >
A monarch who makes the wheel turn,</P>
<P >
A victor in all the four quarters</P>
<P >
And lord of the Jambu-tree Grove.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote868anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote868sym"><SUP>dccclxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
[109]</P>
<P >
With warriors and great princes</P>
<P >
All devoted to your service,</P>
<P >
O Gotama, you should reign</P>
<P >
As ruler of men, king above all kings."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >17.
Buddha</P>
<P >
"I am already a king, O Sela,"</P>
<P >
the Blessed One replied.</P>
<P >
"I am supreme king of the Dhamma,</P>
<P >
I make the Wheel of Dhamma revolve,</P>
<P >
The wheel that none can stop."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >18.
Sela</P>
<P >
"You claim full enlightenment," the brahmin</P>
<P >
Sela said, "You tell me, O Gotama,</P>
<P >
'I am supreme king of the Dhamma,</P>
<P >
I make the Wheel of Dhamma revolve.'</P>
<P >
Who is your general, that disciple</P>
<P >
Who follows in the Master's own way?</P>
<P >
Who is it who helps you to turn</P>
<P >
The wheel set in motion by you?"</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >19.
Buddha</P>
<P >
"The wheel set in motion by me,"</P>
<P >
The Blessed One replied,</P>
<P >
"That same supreme Wheel of Dhamma,</P>
<P >
Sariputta the Tathagata's son</P>
<P >
Helps me in turning this wheel.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
What must be known is directly known,</P>
<P >
What must be developed has been developed,</P>
<P >
What must be abandoned has been abandoned,</P>
<P >
Therefore, brahmin, I am a Buddha.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
So let your doubts about me cease</P>
<P >
And let decision take their place,</P>
<P >
For it is always hard to gain</P>
<P >
Sight of the Enlightened Ones. [110]</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
I am the one whose presence in the world</P>
<P >
Is very rarely come upon,</P>
<P >
I am the Fully Enlightened One,</P>
<P >
I, O brahmin, am the supreme physician.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
I am the holy one beyond compare</P>
<P >
Who has crushed all Mara's teeming hordes;</P>
<P >
Having defeated all my enemies,</P>
<P >
I rejoice free from fear."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >20.
Sela</P>
<P >
"0 sirs, hear this, hear what he says,</P>
<P >
The man of vision, the physician,</P>
<P >
The mighty hero who roars</P>
<P >
Like a lion in the forest.</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Who, even though of outcast birth,</P>
<P >
Would not believe him when he saw</P>
<P >
That he is the holy one beyond compare</P>
<P >
Who has crushed all Mara's teeming hordes?</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P >
Now let him follow me who wants</P>
<P >
And who wants not, let him depart.</P>
<P >
For I will go forth under him,</P>
<P >
This man of lofty wisdom."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >21.
Pupils</P>
<P >
"If, O sir, you now approve</P>
<P >
This teaching of the Enlightened One,</P>
<P >
We too will go forth under him,</P>
<P >
This man of lofty wisdom."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >22.
Sela</P>
<P >
"There are three hundred brahmins here</P>
<P >
Who with uplifted hands implore:</P>
<P >
'O may we live the holy life</P>
<P >
Under you, O Blessed One.'"</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >23.
Buddha</P>
<P >
"The holy life is well proclaimed,</P>
<P >
O Sela," said the Blessed One,</P>
<P >
"To be seen here and not delayed;</P>
<P >
One who trains with diligence</P>
<P >
Will find a fruitful going forth."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >24.
Then the brahmin Sela and his assembly received the going forth under
the Blessed One, and they received the full admission.</P>
<P  >25.
Then, when the night had ended, the matted-hair ascetic Keniya had
good food of various kinds prepared in his own hermitage [111] and
had the time announced to the Blessed One: "It is time, Master
Gotama, the meal is ready." Then, it being morning, the Blessed One
dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went with the Sangha
of bhikkhus to the hermitage of the matted-hair ascetic Keniya and
sat down on the seat made ready. Then, with his own hands, the
matted-hair ascetic Keniya served and satisfied the Sangha of
bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of good food. When
the Blessed One had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl,
the matted-hair ascetic Keniya took a low seat and sat down on one
side. Thereupon the Blessed One gave him his blessing with these
stanzas:</P>
<P  >26.
"Burnt
offerings are the glory of fires,</P>
<P >
Savitri the glory of Vedic hymns,</P>
<P >
Glory of human beings, a king,</P>
<P >
Glory of flowing rivers, the sea;</P>
<P >
The moon is the glory of the stars,</P>
<P >
The sun is the glory of all that shine;</P>
<P >
Merit is the glory of all who aspire;</P>
<P >
The Sangha, glory of those who give."</P>
<P >
<BR>
</P>
<P  >When
the Blessed One had given his blessing with these stanzas, he rose
from his seat and departed.</P>
<P  >27.
Then, not long after their full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn,
diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Sela and his assembly,
[112] by realising for themselves with direct knowledge, here and now
entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the
sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into
homelessness. They directly knew: "Birth is destroyed, the holy
life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no
more coming to any state of being." And the venerable Sela together
with his assembly became arahants.</P>
<P  >28.
'Then the venerable Sela together with his assembly went to the
Blessed One. Having arranged his upper robe on one shoulder,
extending his hands in reverential greeting towards the Blessed One,
he addressed him with these stanzas:</P>
<P  >"Eight
days have passed, All-Seeing One, Since we went to you for refuge. In
these seven nights, O Blessed One, We have been tamed in your
teaching.</P>
<P  >You
are the Buddha, you are the Teacher, You are the Sage, the conqueror
of Mara. Having cut off all evil tendencies,</P>
<P  >You
have crossed and guide humanity across.</P>
<P  >You
have surmounted all attachments, You have removed all the taints. You
are a lion free from clinging, You have abandoned fear and dread.</P>
<P  >Here
these three hundred bhikkhus stand With hands held out in adoration.
O Hero, extend your feet,</P>
<P  >And
let these great beings worship the Teacher."</P>
</body></html>
