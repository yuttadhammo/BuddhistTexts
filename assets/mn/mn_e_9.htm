9. Sammaditthi Sutta - Right View</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There the
venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Friends,
bhikkhus." - "Friend," they replied. The venerable Sariputta
said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"'One of right view, one of right view,' is said, friends. In
what way is a noble disciple one of right view, whose view is
straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived
at this true Dhamma?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote114anc" HREF="#sdendnote114sym"><SUP>cxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Indeed,
friend, we would come from far away to learn from the venerable
Sariputta the meaning of this statement. It would be good if the
venerable Sariputta would explain the meaning of this statement.
Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it."</P>
<P  >"Then,
friends, listen and attend closely to what I shall say." "Yes,
friend," the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Sariputta said this:</P>
<H5 >(THE WHOLESOME AND THE UNWHOLESOME)</H5>
<P  >3.
"When, friends, a noble disciple understands the unwholesome and
the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the
wholesome, [47] in that way he is one of right view, whose view is
straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at
this true Dhamma.</P>
<P  >4.
"And what, friends, is the unwholesome, what is the root of the
unwholesome, what is the wholesome, what is the root of the
wholesome? Killing living beings is unwholesome; taking what is not
given is unwholesome; misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome;
false speech is unwholesome; malicious speech is unwholesome; harsh
speech is unwholesome; gossip is unwholesome; covetousness is
unwholesome; ill will is unwholesome; wrong view is unwholesome. This
is called the unwholesome.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote115anc" HREF="#sdendnote115sym"><SUP>cxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
"And what is the root of the unwholesome? Greed is a root of the
unwholesome; hate is a root of the unwholesome; delusion is a root of
the unwholesome. This is called the root of the unwholesome.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote116anc" HREF="#sdendnote116sym"><SUP>cxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >6.
"And what is the wholesome? Abstention from killing living beings
is wholesome; abstention from taking what is not given is wholesome;
abstention from misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome;
abstention from false speech is wholesome; abstention from malicious
speech is wholesome; abstention from harsh speech is wholesome;
abstention from gossip is wholesome; uncovetousness is wholesome;
non-ill will is wholesome; right view is wholesome. This is called
the wholesome.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote117anc" HREF="#sdendnote117sym"><SUP>cxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >7.
"And what is the root of the wholesome? Non-greed is a root of the
wholesome; non-hate is a root of the wholesome; non-delusion is a
root of the wholesome. This is called the root of the wholesome.</P>
<P  >8.
"When a noble disciple has thus understood the unwholesome and the
root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the
wholesome,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote118anc" HREF="#sdendnote118sym"><SUP>cxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust, he abolishes
the underlying tendency to aversion, he extirpates the underlying
tendency to the view and conceit 'I am,' and by abandoning
ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of
suffering.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote119anc" HREF="#sdendnote119sym"><SUP>cxix</SUP></A></SUP>
In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view, whose view is
straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, -and has arrived
at this true Dhamma."</P>
<H5 >(NUTRIMENT)</H5>
<P  >9.
Saying, "Good, friend," the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in
the venerable Sariputta's words. Then they asked him a further
question: "But, friend, might there be another way in which a noble
disciple is one of right view … and has arrived at this true
Dhamma?" - "There might be, friends.</P>
<P  >10.
"When, friends, a noble disciple understands nutriment, the origin
of nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the
cessation of nutriment, in that way he is one of right view … and
has arrived [48] at this true Dhamma.</P>
<P  >11.
"And what is nutriment, what is the origin of nutriment, what is
the cessation of nutriment, what is the way leading to the cessation
of nutriment? There are four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance
of beings that already have come to be and for the support of those
seeking a new existence. What four? They are: physical food as
nutriment, gross or subtle; contact as the second; mental volition as
the third; and consciousness as the fourth.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote120anc" HREF="#sdendnote120sym"><SUP>cxx</SUP></A></SUP>
With the arising of craving there is the arising of nutriment. With
the cessation of craving there is the cessation of nutriment. The way
leading to the cessation of nutriment is just this Noble Eightfold
Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
concentration.</P>
<P  >12.
"When a noble disciple has thus understood nutriment, the origin of
nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the
cessation of nutriment, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency
to greed, he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion, he
extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit 'I am,'
and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and
now makes an end of suffering. In that way too a noble disciple is
one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence
in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma."</P>

<P  >14.

of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the
cessation of suffering, in that way he is one of right view … and
has arrived at this true Dhamma.</P>
<P  >15.
"And what is suffering, what is the origin of suffering, what is
the cessation of suffering, what is the way leading to the cessation
of suffering? Birth is suffering; ageing is suffering; sickness is
suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair are suffering; not to obtain what one wants is suffering; in
short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering. This
is called suffering.</P>
<P  >16.
"And what is the origin of suffering? It is craving, which brings
renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in
this and that; that is, craving for sensual pleasures [49], craving
for being, and craving for non-being. This is called the origin of
suffering.</P>
<P  >17.
"And what is the cessation of suffering? It is the remainderless
fading away and ceasing, the giving up, relinquishing, letting go,
and rejecting of that same craving. This is called the cessation of
suffering.</P>
<P  >18.
"And what is the way leading to the cessation of suffering? It is
just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view … right
concentration. This is called the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.</P>
<P  >19.
"When a noble disciple has thus understood suffering, the origin of
suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the
cessation of suffering … he here and now makes an end of suffering.
In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view … and has
arrived at this true Dhamma."</P>

<P  >21.

origin of ageing and death, the cessation of ageing and death, and
the way leading to the cessation of ageing and death, in that way he

<P  >22.
"And what is ageing and death, what is the origin of ageing and
death, what is the cessation of ageing and death, what is the way
leading to the cessation of -ageing and death? The ageing of beings
in the various orders of beings, their old age, brokenness of teeth,
greyness of hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of life, weakness of
faculties - this is called ageing. The passing of beings out of the
various orders of beings, their passing away, dissolution,
disappearance, dying, completion of time, dissolution of the
aggregates,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote122anc" HREF="#sdendnote122sym"><SUP>cxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
laying down of the body - this is called death. So this ageing and
this death are what is called ageing and death. With the arising of
birth there is the arising of ageing and death. With the cessation of
birth there is the cessation of ageing and death. The way leading to
the cessation of ageing and death is just this Noble Eightfold Path;
that is, right view … right concentration.</P>

"When a noble disciple has thus understood the taints, the origin
of the taints, the cessation of the taints, and the way leading to
the cessation of the taints, he entirely abandons the underlying
tendency to lust, he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion,
he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and conceit 'I
am,' and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he
here and now makes an end of suffering. In that way too a noble
disciple is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has
perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true
Dhamma."</P>
<P  >That
is what the venerable Sariputta said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the venerable Sariputta's words.</P>
