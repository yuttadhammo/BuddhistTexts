11. Culasihanada Sutta - The Shorter Discourse<BR>on the Lion's
Roar</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, only here is there a recluse, only here a second
recluse, only here a third recluse, only here a fourth recluse. The
doctrines of others are devoid [64] of recluses: that is how you
should rightly roar your lion's roar.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote166anc" HREF="#sdendnote166sym"><SUP>clxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
"It is possible, bhikkhus, that wanderers of other sects might ask:
'But on the strength of what [argument] or with the support of what
[authority] do the venerable ones say thus?' Wanderers of other
sects who ask thus may be answered in this way: 'Friends, four
things have been declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened; on seeing these in
ourselves we say thus: "Only here is there a recluse, only here a
second recluse, only here a third recluse, only here a fourth
recluse. The doctrines of others are devoid of recluses." What are
the four? We have confidence in the Teacher, we have confidence in
the Dhamma, we have fulfilled the precepts, and our companions in the
Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us whether they are laymen or those
gone forth. These are the four things declared to us by the Blessed
One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, on seeing
which in ourselves we say as we do.'</P>
<P  >4.
"It is possible, bhikkhus, that wanderers of other sects might say
thus: 'Friends, we too have confidence in the Teacher, that is, in
our Teacher; we too have confidence in the Dhamma, that is, in our
Dhamma; we too have fulfilled the precepts, that is, our precepts;
and our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us too
whether they are laymen or those gone forth. What is the distinction
here, friends, what is the variance, what is the difference between
you and us?'</P>
<P  >5.
"Wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this way:
'How then, friends, is the goal one or many?' Answering rightly,
the wanderers of other sects would answer thus: 'Friends, the goal
is one, not many.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote167anc" HREF="#sdendnote167sym"><SUP>clxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
-'But, friends, is that goal for one affected by lust or free from
lust?' Answering rightly, the wanderers of other sects would answer
thus: 'Friends, that goal is for one free from lust, not for one
affected by lust.' - 'But, friends, is that goal for one affected
by hate or free from hate?' Answering rightly, they would answer:
'Friends, that goal is for one free from hate, not for one affected
by hate.' - 'But, friends, is that goal for one affected by
delusion or free from delusion?' Answering rightly, they would
answer: 'Friends, that goal is for one free from delusion, not for
one affected by delusion.' -'But, friends, is that goal for one
affected by craving or free from craving?' [65] Answering rightly,
they would answer: 'Friends, that goal is for one free from
craving, not for one affected by craving.' - 'But, friends, is
that goal for one affected by clinging or free from clinging?'
Answering rightly, they would answer: 'Friends, that goal is for
one free from clinging, not for one affected by clinging.' -'But,
friends, is that goal for one who has vision or for one without
vision?' Answering rightly, they would answer: 'Friends, that
goal is for one with vision, not for one without vision.' - 'But,
friends, is that goal for one who favours and opposes, or for one who
does not favour and oppose?' Answering rightly, they would answer:
'Friends, that goal is for one who does not favour and oppose, not
for one who favours and opposes.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote168anc" HREF="#sdendnote168sym"><SUP>clxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
- 'But, friends, is that goal for one who delights in and enjoys
proliferation, or for one who does not delight in and enjoy
proliferation?' Answering rightly, they would answer: 'Friends,
that goal is for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation,
not for one who delights in and enjoys proliferation.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote169anc" HREF="#sdendnote169sym"><SUP>clxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>

"Bhikkhus, there are these two views: the view of being and the
view of non-being. Any recluses or brahmins who rely on the view of
being, adopt the view of being, accept the view of being, are opposed
to the view of non-being. Any recluses or brahmins who rely on the
view of non-being, adopt the view of non-being, accept the view of
non-being, are opposed to the view of being.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote170anc" HREF="#sdendnote170sym"><SUP>clxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >7.
"Any recluses or brahmins who do not understand as they actually
are the origin, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger, and
the escape<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote171anc" HREF="#sdendnote171sym"><SUP>clxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
in the case of these two views are affected by lust, affected by
hate, affected by delusion, affected by craving, affected by
clinging, without vision, given to favouring and opposing, and they
delight in and enjoy proliferation. They are not freed from birth,
ageing, and death; from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair; they are not freed from suffering, I say.</P>

"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of clinging. What four?
Clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to rules
and observances, and clinging to a doctrine of self.</P>
<P  >10.
"Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full
understanding of all kinds of clinging, they do not completely
describe the full understanding of all kinds of clinging.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote172anc" HREF="#sdendnote172sym"><SUP>clxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
They describe the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures
without describing the full understanding of clinging to views,
clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to a doctrine of
self. Why is that? Those good recluses and brahmins do not understand
these three instances of clinging as they actually are. Therefore,
though they claim to propound the full understanding of all kinds of
clinging, they describe only the full understanding of clinging to
sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of
clinging to views, clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to
a doctrine of self.</P>
<P  >11.
"Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full
understanding of all kinds of clinging … they describe the full
understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views
without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and
observances and clinging to a doctrine of self. Why is that? They do
not understand two instances … therefore they describe only the
full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to
views without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules
and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self.</P>
<P  >12.
"Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full
understanding of all kinds of clinging … they describe the full
understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views,
and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full
understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self. They do not
understand one instance … therefore they describe only the full
understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views,
and clinging to rules and observances without describing the full
understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote173anc" HREF="#sdendnote173sym"><SUP>clxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>

"Bhikkhus, in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that, it is plain
that confidence in the Teacher is not rightly directed, that
confidence in the Dhamma is not rightly directed, that fulfilment of
the precepts is not rightly directed, and that the affection among
companions in the Dhamma is not rightly directed. Why is that?
Because that is how it is when the Dhamma and Discipline is [67]
badly proclaimed and badly expounded, unemancipating, unconducive to
peace, expounded by one who is not fully enlightened.</P>
<P  >14.
"Bhikkhus, when a Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened,
claims to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging,
he completely describes the full understanding of all kinds of
clinging: he describes the full understanding of clinging to sensual
pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to rules and observances, and
clinging to a doctrine of self.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote174anc" HREF="#sdendnote174sym"><SUP>clxxiv</SUP></A></SUP></P>

"Bhikkhus, in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that, it is plain
that confidence in the Teacher is rightly directed, that confidence
in the Dhamma is rightly directed, that fulfilment of the precepts is
rightly directed, and that the affection among companions in the
Dhamma is rightly directed. Why is that? Because that is how it is
when the Dhamma and Discipline is well-proclaimed and well-expounded,
emancipating, conducive to peace, expounded by one who is fully
enlightened.</P>

"Now these four kinds of clinging have what as their source, what
as their origin, from what are they born and produced?</P>
<P  >These
four kinds of clinging have craving as their source, craving as their
origin, they are born and produced from craving.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote175anc" HREF="#sdendnote175sym"><SUP>clxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Craving has what as its source … ? Craving has feeling as its
source … Feeling has what as its source … ? Feeling has contact
as its source … Contact has what as its source … ? Contact has
the sixfold base as its source … The sixfold base has what as its
source … ? The sixfold base has mentality-materiality as its source
… Mentality-materiality has what as its source … ?
Mentalitymateriality has consciousness as its source …
Consciousness has what as its source … ? Consciousness has
formations as its source … Formations have what as their source …
? Formations have ignorance as their source, ignorance as their
origin, they are born and produced from ignorance.</P>
<P  >17.
"Bhikkhus, when ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge has
arisen in a bhikkhu, then with the fading away of ignorance and the
arising of true knowledge he no longer clings to sensual pleasures,
no longer clings to views, no longer clings to rules and observances,
no longer clings to a doctrine of self.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote176anc" HREF="#sdendnote176sym"><SUP>clxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
When he does not cling, he is not agitated. When he is not agitated,
he personally attains Nibbana. He understands: 'Birth is destroyed,
the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done,
there is no more coming to any state of being.'" [68]</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
