THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote133anc" HREF="#sdendnote133sym"><SUP>cxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country at a
town of the Kurus named Kammasadhamma.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote134anc" HREF="#sdendnote134sym"><SUP>cxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable
sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, this is the direct path<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote135anc" HREF="#sdendnote135sym"><SUP>cxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
for the purification of beings [56], for the surmounting of sorrow
and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the
attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbana - namely,
the four foundations of mindfulness.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote136anc" HREF="#sdendnote136sym"><SUP>cxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
“What are the four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote137anc" HREF="#sdendnote137sym"><SUP>cxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
abides contemplating the body as a body, ardent, fully aware, and
mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote138anc" HREF="#sdendnote138sym"><SUP>cxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
He abides contemplating feelings as feelings, ardent, fully aware,
and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He
abides contemplating mind as mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful,
having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides
contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and
mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote139anc" HREF="#sdendnote139sym"><SUP>cxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(CONTEMPLATION OF THE BODY)</H3>
<H4 >(1. Mindfulness of Breathing)</H4>
<P  >4.
“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu abide contemplating the body as
a body? Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree
or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set
his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him, ever
mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out. Breathing in long,
he understands: ‘I breathe in long’; or breathing out long, he
understands: ‘I breathe out long.’ Breathing in short, he
understands: ‘I breathe in short’; or breathing out short, he
understands: ‘I breathe out short.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote140anc" HREF="#sdendnote140sym"><SUP>cxl</SUP></A></SUP>
He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body [of
breath]’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the
whole body [of breath].’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote141anc" HREF="#sdendnote141sym"><SUP>cxli</SUP></A></SUP>
He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in tranquillizing the bodily
formation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillizing
the bodily formation.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote142anc" HREF="#sdendnote142sym"><SUP>cxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long turn,
understands: ‘I make a long turn’; or, when making a short turn,
understands: ‘I make a short turn’; so too, breathing in long, a
bhikkhu understands: ‘I breathe in long’ … he trains thus: ‘I
shall breathe out tranquillizing the bodily formation.’</P>

“In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally,

<P  >6.
“Again, bhikkhus, when walking, a bhikkhu understands: ‘I am
walking’; when standing, he understands: ‘I am standing’; when
sitting, [57] he understands: ‘I am sitting’; when lying down, he
understands: ‘I am lying down’; or he understands accordingly
however his body is disposed.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote146anc" HREF="#sdendnote146sym"><SUP>cxlvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P  >8.
“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness when
going forward and returning;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote147anc" HREF="#sdendnote147sym"><SUP>cxlvii</SUP></A></SUP>
who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; who
acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs; who acts
in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe
and bowl; who acts in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming
food, and tasting; who acts in full awareness when defecating and
urinating; who acts in full awareness when walking, standing,
sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.</P>

bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</P>
<H4 >(4. Foulness - The Bodily Parts)</H4>
<P  >10.
“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the
soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair, bounded by skin,
as full of many kinds of impurity thus: ‘In this body there are
head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones,
bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, large
intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach, feces, bile,
phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of
the joints, and urine.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote148anc" HREF="#sdendnote148sym"><SUP>cxlviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as though there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of
many sorts of grain, such as hill rice, red rice, beans, peas,
millet, and white rice, and a man with good eyes were to open it and
review it thus: ‘This is hill rice, this is red rice, these are
beans, these are peas, this is millet, this is white rice’; so too,
a bhikkhu reviews this same body … as full of many kinds of
impurity thus: ‘In this body there are head-hairs … and urine.’</P>

“In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally,

<H4 >(5. Elements)</H4>
<P  >12.
“Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body, however it is
placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements thus: ‘In this
body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire
element, and the air element.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote149anc" HREF="#sdendnote149sym"><SUP>cxlix</SUP></A></SUP>
[58] Just as though a skilled butcher or his apprentice had killed a

thus: ‘In this body there are the earth element, the water element,

“Again, bhikkhus, as though he were to see a corpse thrown aside in

oozing matter, a bhikkhu compares this same body with it thus: ‘This
