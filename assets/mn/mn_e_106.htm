106. Anenjasappaya Sutta - The Way to the Imperturbable</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1007anc" HREF="#sdendnote1007sym"><SUP>mvii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country at a
town of the Kurus named Kammasadhamma. There the Blessed One
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, sensual pleasures<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1008anc" HREF="#sdendnote1008sym"><SUP>mviii</SUP></A></SUP>
are impermanent, hollow, false, deceptive; they are illusory, the
prattle of fools. Sensual pleasures here and now and sensual
pleasures in lives to come, [262] sensual perceptions here and now
and sensual perceptions in lives to come - both alike are Mara's
realm, Mara's domain, Mara's bait, Mara's hunting ground. On
account of them, these evil unwholesome mental states such as
covetousness, ill will, and presumption arise, and they constitute an
obstruction to a noble disciple in training here.</P>
<H3 >(THE IMPERTURBABLE)</H3>
<P  >3.
"Therein, bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus: 'Sensual
pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come â€¦
constitute an obstruction to a noble disciple in training here.
Suppose I were to abide with a mind abundant and exalted, having
transcended the world and made a firm resolution with the mind.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1009anc" HREF="#sdendnote1009sym"><SUP>mix</SUP></A></SUP>
When I do so, there will be no more evil unwholesome mental states
such as covetousness, ill will, and presumption in me, and with the
abandoning of them my mind will be unlimited, immeasurable, and well
developed.' When he practises in this way and frequently abides
thus, his mind acquires confidence in this base.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1010anc" HREF="#sdendnote1010sym"><SUP>mx</SUP></A></SUP>
Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the imperturbable
now or else he decides upon [perfecting] wisdom. On the dissolution
of the body, after death, it is possible that this consciousness of
his, leading [to rebirth], may pass on [to rebirth] in the
imperturbable.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1011anc" HREF="#sdendnote1011sym"><SUP>mxi</SUP></A></SUP>
This, bhikkhus, is declared to be the first way directed to the
imperturbable.</P>
<P  >4.
"Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1012anc" HREF="#sdendnote1012sym"><SUP>mxii</SUP></A></SUP>
'[There are] sensual pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures
in lives to come, sensual perceptions here and now and sensual
perceptions in lives to come; whatever material form [there is], all
material form is the four great elements and the material form
derived from the four great elements.' When he practises in this
way and frequently abides thus, his mind acquires confidence in this
base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the
imperturbable now or else he decides upon [perfecting] wisdom. On the
dissolution of the body, after death, it is possible that this
consciousness of his, leading [to rebirth], may pass on [to rebirth]
in the imperturbable. This, bhikkhus, is declared to be the second
way directed to the imperturbable. [263]</P>
<P  >5.
"Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1013anc" HREF="#sdendnote1013sym"><SUP>mxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
'Sensual pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to
come, sensual perceptions here and now and sensual perceptions in
lives to come, material forms here and now and material forms in
lives to come, perceptions of forms here and now and perceptions of
forms in lives to come - both alike are impermanent. What is
impermanent is not worth delighting in, not worth welcoming, not
worth holding to.' When he practises in this way and frequently
abides thus, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is
full confidence, he either attains to the imperturbable now or else
he decides upon [perfecting] wisdom. On the dissolution of the body,
after death, it is possible that this consciousness of his, leading
[to rebirth], may pass on [to rebirth] in the imperturbable. This,
bhikkhus, is declared to be the third way directed to the
imperturbable.</P>
<H3 >(THE BASE OF NOTHINGNESS)</H3>
<P  >6.
"Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus:<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1014anc" HREF="#sdendnote1014sym"><SUP>mxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
'Sensual pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to
come, sensual perceptions here and now and sensual perceptions in
lives to come, material forms here and now and material forms in
lives to come, perceptions of forms here and now and perceptions of
forms in lives to come, and perceptions of the imperturbable - all
are perceptions. Where these perceptions cease without remainder,
that is the peaceful, that is the sublime, namely, the base of
nothingness.' When he practises in this way and frequently abides
thus, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full
confidence, he either attains to the base of nothingness now or else
he decides upon [perfecting] wisdom. On the dissolution of the body,
after death, it is possible that this consciousness of his, leading
[to rebirth], may pass on [to rebirth] in the base of nothingness.
This, bhikkhus, is declared to be the first way directed to the base
of nothingness.</P>
<P  >7.
"Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple, gone to the forest or to the
root of a tree or to an empty hut, considers thus: 'This is void of
a self or of what belongs to a self.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1015anc" HREF="#sdendnote1015sym"><SUP>mxv</SUP></A></SUP>
When he practises in this way and frequently abides thus, his mind
acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he
either attains to the base of nothingness now or else he decides upon
[perfecting] wisdom. On the dissolution of the body, after death, it
is possible that this consciousness of his, leading [to rebirth], may
pass on [to rebirth] in the base of nothingness. This, bhikkhus, is
declared to be the second way directed to the base of nothingness.</P>
<P  >8.
"Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus: 'I am not
anything belonging to anyone anywhere, [264] nor is there any thing
belonging to me in anyone anywhere.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1016anc" HREF="#sdendnote1016sym"><SUP>mxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
When he practises in this way and frequently abides thus, his mind
acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he
either attains to the base of nothingness now or else he decides upon
[perfecting] wisdom. On the dissolution of the body, after death, it
is possible that this consciousness of his, leading [to rebirth], may
pass on [to rebirth] in the base of nothingness. This, bhikkhus, is
declared to be the third way directed to the base of nothingness.</P>
<H3 >(THE BASE OF
NEITHER-PERCEPTION-NOR-NON-PERCEPTION)</H3>
<P  >9.
"Again, bhikkhus, a noble disciple considers thus: 'Sensual
pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come,
sensual perceptions here and now and sensual perceptions in lives to
come, material forms here and now and material forms in lives to
come, perceptions of forms here and now and perceptions of forms in
lives to come, perceptions of the imperturbable, and perceptions of
the base of nothingness - all are perceptions. Where these
perceptions cease without remainder, that is the peaceful, that is
the sublime, namely, the base of
neitherperception-nor-non-perception.' When he practises in this
way and frequently abides thus, his mind acquires confidence in this
base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception now or else he decides upon
[perfecting] wisdom. On the dissolution of the body, after death, it
is possible that this consciousness of his, leading [to rebirth], may
pass on [to rebirth] in the base of
neither-perceptionnor-non-perception. This, bhikkhus, is declared to
be the way directed to the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception."</P>
<H3 >(NIBBANA)</H3>
<P  >10.
When this was said, the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One:
"Venerable sir, here a bhikkhu is practising thus: 'If it were
not, it would not be mine; it will not be and it will not be mine.
What exists, what has come to be, that I am abandoning.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1017anc" HREF="#sdendnote1017sym"><SUP>mxvii</SUP></A></SUP>'
Thus he obtains equanimity.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1018anc" HREF="#sdendnote1018sym"><SUP>mxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Venerable sir, does such a bhikkhu attain Nibbana?"</P>
<P  >"One
bhikkhu here, Ananda, might attain Nibbana, another bhikkhu here
might not attain Nibbana."</P>
<P  >"What
is the cause and reason, venerable sir, why one bhikkhu here might
attain Nibbana, while another bhikkhu here might not attain Nibbana?"</P>
<P  >"Here,
Ananda, a bhikkhu is practising thus: 'If it were not, it would not
be mine; it will not be and it will not be mine. What exists, [265]
what has come to be, that I am abandoning.' Thus he obtains
equanimity. He delights in that equanimity, welcomes it, and remains
holding to it. As he does so, his consciousness becomes dependent on
it and clings to it. A bhikkhu, Ananda, who is affected by clinging
does not attain Nibbana."</P>
<P  >11.
"But, venerable sir, when that bhikkhu clings, what does he cling
to?"</P>
<P  >"To
the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, Ananda."</P>
<P  >"When
that bhikkhu clings, venerable sir, it seems he clings to the best
[object of] clinging."</P>
<P  >"When
that bhikkhu clings, Ananda, he clings to the best [object of]
clinging; for this is the best [object of] clinging, name ly, the
base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1019anc" HREF="#sdendnote1019sym"><SUP>mxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >12.
"Here, Ananda, a bhikkhu is practising thus: 'If it were not, it
would not be mine; it will not be and it will not be mine. What
exists, what has come to be, that I am abandoning.' Thus he obtains
equanimity. He does not delight in that equanimity, welcome it, or
remain holding to it. Since he does not do so, his consciousness does
not become dependent on it and does not cling to it. A bhikkhu,
Ananda, who is without clinging attains Nibbana."</P>
<P  >13.
"It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! The Blessed One,
indeed, has explained to us the crossing of the flood in dependence
upon one support or another.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1020anc" HREF="#sdendnote1020sym"><SUP>mxx</SUP></A></SUP>
But, venerable sir, what is noble liberation?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1021anc" HREF="#sdendnote1021sym"><SUP>mxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Here,
Ananda, a noble disciple considers thus: 'Sensual pleasures here
and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come, sensual perceptions
here and now and sensual perceptions in lives to come, material forms
here and now and material forms in lives to come, perceptions of
forms here and now and perceptions of forms in lives to come,
perceptions of the imperturbable, perceptions of the base of
nothingness, and perceptions of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception - this is personality as far as
personality extends.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1022anc" HREF="#sdendnote1022sym"><SUP>mxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the Deathless, namely, the liberation of the mind through not
clinging.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1023anc" HREF="#sdendnote1023sym"><SUP>mxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
"Thus, Ananda, I have taught the way directed to the imperturbable,
I have taught the way directed to the base of nothingness, I have
taught the way directed to the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, I have taught the crossing of
the flood in dependence upon one support or another, I have taught
noble liberation.</P>
<P  >15.
"What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a
teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, [266]
that I have done for you, Ananda. There are these roots of trees,
these empty huts. Meditate, Ananda, do not delay, or else you will
regret it later. This is our instruction to you."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
