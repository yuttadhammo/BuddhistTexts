152. Indriyabhavana Sutta - The Development of the Faculties</H2>
<P  >[298]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Kajangala in a grove of mukhelu trees.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the brahmin student Uttara, a pupil of the brahmin Parasariya,
went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this
courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side. The
Blessed One then asked him: "Uttara, does the brahmin Parasariya
teach his disciples the development of the faculties?"</P>
<P  >"He
does, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"But,
Uttara, how does he teach his disciples the development of the
faculties?"</P>
<P  >"Here,.
Master Gotama, one does not see forms with the eye, one does not hear
sounds with the ear. That is how the brahmin Parasariya teaches his
disciples the development of the faculties."</P>
<P  >"If
that is so, Uttara, then a blind man and a deaf man will have
developed faculties, according to what the brahmin Parasariya says.
For a blind man does not see forms with the eye, and a deaf man does
not hear sounds with the ear."</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin student Uttara, Parasariya's pupil, sat
silent, dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and
without response.</P>
<P  >3.
Then, knowing this, the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda:
"Ananda, the brahmin Parasariya teaches his disciples the
development of the faculties in one way, but in the Noble One's
Discipline the supreme development of the faculties is otherwise."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1352anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1352sym"><SUP>mccclii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Now
is the time, Blessed One, now is the time, Sublime One, for the
Blessed One [299] to teach the supreme development of the faculties
in the Noble One's Discipline. Having heard it from the Blessed
One, the bhikkhus will remember it."</P>
<P  >"Then
listen, Ananda, and attend closely to what I shall say."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," he replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >4.
"Now, Ananda, how is there the supreme development of the faculties
in the Noble One's Discipline? Here, Ananda, when a bhikkhu sees a
form with the eye, there arises in him what is agreeable, there
arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and
disagreeable.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1353anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1353sym"><SUP>mcccliii</SUP></A></SUP>
He understands thus: 'There has arisen in me what is agreeable,
there has arisen what is disagreeable, there has arisen what is both
agreeable and disagreeable. But that is conditioned, gross,
dependently arisen; this is peaceful, this is sublime, that is,
equanimity.' The agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose,
and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease in him and
equanimity is established.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1354anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1354sym"><SUP>mcccliv</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as a man with good sight, having opened his eyes might shut them
or having shut his eyes might open them, so too concerning anything
at all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and
the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly,
just as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This
is called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of
the faculties regarding forms cognizable by the eye.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1355anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1355sym"><SUP>mccclv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
"Again, Ananda, when a bhikkhu hears a sound with the ear, there
arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable,
there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands
thus: ... and equanimity is established. Just as a strong man might
easily snap his fingers, so too concerning anything at all, the
agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both
agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as
rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is
called in the Noble One's Discipline the supreme development of the
faculties regarding sounds cognizable by the ear.</P>
<P  >6.
"Again, Ananda, when a bhikkhu smells an odour with the nose, there
arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable,
there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable. He understands
thus: ... and equanimity is established. Just as [300] raindrops on a
slightly sloping lotus leaf roll off and do not remain there, so too
concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the
disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that
arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and
equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's
Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding odours
cognizable by the nose.</P>
<P  >7.
"Again, Ananda, when a bhikkhu tastes a flavour with the tongue,
there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is
disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable.
He understands thus: ... and equanimity is established. Just as a
strong man might easily spit out a ball of spittle collected on the
tip of his tongue, so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable
that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and
disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just
as easily, and equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble
One's Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding
flavours cognizable by the tongue.</P>
<P  >8.
"Again, Ananda, when a bhikkhu touches a tangible with the body,
there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is
disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable.
He understands thus: ... and equanimity is established. Just as a
strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, so
too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the
disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that
arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and
equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's
Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding
tangibles cognizable by the body.</P>
<P  >9.
"Again, Ananda, when a bhikkhu cognizes a mind-object with the
mind, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is
disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable.
He understands thus: ... and equanimity is established. Just as if a
man were to let two or three drops of water fall onto an iron plate
heated for a whole day, the falling of the drops might be slow but
they would quickly vaporise and vanish,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1356anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1356sym"><SUP>mccclvi</SUP></A></SUP>
so too concerning anything at all, the agreeable that arose, the
disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that
arose cease just as quickly, just as rapidly, just as easily, and
equanimity is established. This is called in the Noble One's
Discipline the supreme development of the faculties regarding ideas
cognizable by the mind.</P>
<P  >"That
is how there is the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble
One's Discipline.</P>
<P  >10.
"And how, Ananda, is one a disciple in higher training, one who has
entered upon the way? Here, Ananda, when a bhikkhu sees a form with
the eye ... [301] hears a sound with the ear ... smells an odour with
the nose ... tastes a flavour with the tongue ... touches a tangible
with the body ... cognizes a mindobject with the mind, there arises
in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there
arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable; he is ashamed,
humiliated and disgusted by the agreeable that arose, by the
disagreeable that arose, and by the both agreeable and disagreeable
that arose.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1357anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1357sym"><SUP>mccclvii</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how one is a disciple in higher training, one who has entered
upon the way.</P>
<P  >11-16.
"And how, Ananda, is one a noble one with developed faculties?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1358anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1358sym"><SUP>mccclviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Here, Ananda, when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye ... hears a

If he should wish: 'May I abide perceiving the unrepulsive in the
repulsive,' he abides perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive.
If he should wish: 'May I abide perceiving the repulsive in the
unrepulsive,' he abides perceiving the repulsive in the
unrepulsive. If he should wish: 'May I abide perceiving the
unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,' he abides
perceiving the unrepulsive in that. If he should wish: 'May I abide
perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,' he
abides perceiving the repulsive in that. If he should wish: 'May I,
avoiding both the repulsive and unrepulsive, [302] abide in
equanimity, mindful and fully aware,' he abides in equanimity
towards that, mindful and fully aware.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1360anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1360sym"><SUP>mccclx</SUP></A></SUP>
That is how one is a noble one with developed faculties.</P>
<P  >17.
"So, Ananda, the supreme development of the faculties in the Noble
One's Discipline has been taught by me, the disciple in higher
training who has entered upon the way has been taught by me, and the
noble one with developed faculties has been taught by me.</P>
<P  >18.
"What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a
Teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I
have done for you, Ananda. There are these roots of trees, these
empty huts. Meditate, Ananda, do not delay, or else you will regret
it later. This is our instruction to you."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
