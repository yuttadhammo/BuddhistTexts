20. Vitakkasanthana Sutta - The Removal of Distracting Thoughts</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote238anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote238sym"><SUP>ccxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's
Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:
"Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir," [119] they replied. The
Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is pursuing the higher mind, from time to
time he should give attention to five signs.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote239anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote239sym"><SUP>ccxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
What are the five?</P>
<P  >3.
(i) "Here, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is giving attention to some
sign, and owing to that sign there arise in him evil unwholesome
thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with delusion, then he
should give attention to some other sign connected with what is
wholesome.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote240anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote240sym"><SUP>ccxl</SUP></A></SUP>
When he gives attention to some other sign connected with what is
wholesome, then any evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire,
with hate, and with delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With
the abandoning of them his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted,
brought to singleness, and concentrated. Just as a skilled carpenter
or his apprentice might knock out, remove, and extract a coarse peg
by means of a fine one, so too ... when a bhikkhu gives attention to
some other sign connected with what is wholesome ... his mind becomes
steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated.</P>
<P  >4.
(ii) "If, while he is giving attention to some other sign connected
with what is wholesome, there still arise in him evil unwholesome
thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with delusion, then he
should examine the danger in those thoughts thus: 'These thoughts
are unwholesome, they are reprehensible, they result in suffering.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote241anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote241sym"><SUP>ccxli</SUP></A></SUP>
When he examines the danger in those thoughts, then any evil
unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with
delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With the abandoning of
them his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to
singleness, and concentrated. Just as a man or a woman, young,
youthful, and fond of ornaments, would be horrified, humiliated, and
disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human being [120]
were hung around his or her neck, so too ... when a bhikkhu examines
the danger in those thoughts ... his mind becomes steadied
internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and concentrated.</P>
<P  >5.
(iii) "If, while he is examining the danger in those thoughts,
there still arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts connected with
desire, with hate, and with delusion, then he should try to forget
those thoughts and should not give attention to them. When he tries
to forget those thoughts and does not give attention to them, then
any evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and
with delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With the abandoning
of them his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to
singleness, and concentrated. Just as a man with good eyes who did
not want to see forms that had come within range of sight would
either shut his eyes or look away, so too ... when a bhikkhu tries to
forget those thoughts and does not give attention to them ... his
mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated.</P>
<P  >6.
(iv) "If, while he is trying to forget those thoughts and is not
giving attention to them, there still arise in him evil unwholesome
thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with delusion, then he
should give attention to stilling the thought-formation of those
thoughts.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote242anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote242sym"><SUP>ccxlii</SUP></A></SUP>
When he gives attention to stilling the thoughtformation of those
thoughts, then any evil unwholesome thoughts connected with desire,
with hate, and with delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With
the abandoning of them his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted,
brought to singleness, and concentrated. Just as a man walking fast
might consider: 'Why am I walking fast? What if I walk slowly?'
and he would walk slowly; then he might consider: 'Why am I walking
slowly? What if I stand?' and he would stand; then he might
consider: 'Why am I standing? What if I sit?' and he would sit;
then he might consider: 'Why am I sitting? What if I lie down?'
and he would lie down. By doing so he would substitute for each
grosser posture one that was subtler. So too ... when a bhikkhu gives
attention to stilling the thought-formation of those thoughts ... his
mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated.</P>
<P  >7.
(v) "If, while he is giving attention to stilling the
thoughtformation of those thoughts, there still arise in him evil
unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, with hate, and with
delusion, then, with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed
against the roof of his mouth, he should beat down, constrain, and
crush mind with mind.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote243anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote243sym"><SUP>ccxliii</SUP></A></SUP>
[121] When, with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against
the roof of his mouth, he beats down, constrains, and crushes mind
with mind, then any evil unwholesome thoughts connected. with desire,
with hate, and with delusion are abandoned in him and subside. With
the abandoning of them his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted,
brought to singleness, and concentrated. Just as a strong man might
seize a weaker man by the head or shoulders and beat him down,
constrain him, and crush him, so too ... when, with his teeth
clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his mouth, a
bhikkhu beats down, constrains, and crushes mind with mind ... his
mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and
concentrated.</P>
<P  >8.
"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is giving attention to some sign, and
owing to that sign there arise in him evil unwholesome thoughts
connected with desire, with hate, and with delusion, then when he
gives attention to some other sign connected with what is wholesome,
any such evil unwholesome thoughts are abandoned in him and subside,
and with the abandoning of them his mind becomes steadied internally,
quieted, brought to singleness, and concentrated. When he examines
the danger in those thoughts ... When he tries to forget those
thoughts and does not give attention to them ... When he gives
attention to stilling the thought-formation of those thoughts ...
When, with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof
of his mouth, he beats down, constrains, and crushes mind with mind,
any such evil unwholesome thoughts are abandoned in him ... and his
mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, [122] brought to
singleness, and concentrated. This bhikkhu is then called a master of
the courses of thought. He will think whatever thought he wishes to
think and he will not think any thought that he does not wish to
think. He has severed craving, flung off the fetters, and with the
complete penetration of conceit he has made an end of suffering."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote244anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote244sym"><SUP>ccxliv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
