140. Dhatuvibhanga Sutta - The Exposition of the Elements</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in
the Magadhan country and eventually arrived at Rajagaha. There he
went to the potter Bhaggava and said to him:</P>
<P  >2.
"If it is not inconvenient for you, Bhaggava, I will stay one night
in your workshop."</P>
<P  >"It
is not inconvenient for me, venerable sir, but there is a homeless
one already staying there. If he agrees, then stay as long as you
like, venerable sir." [238]</P>
<P  >3.
Now there was a clansman named Pukkusati who had gone forth from the
home life into homelessness out of faith in the Blessed One, and on
that occasion he was already staying in the potter's workshop.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1264anc" HREF="#sdendnote1264sym"><SUP>mcclxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the Blessed One went to the venerable Pukkusati and said to him:
"If it is not inconvenient for you, bhikkhu, I will stay one night
in the workshop."</P>
<P  >"The
potter's workshop is large enough, friend.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1265anc" HREF="#sdendnote1265sym"><SUP>mcclxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Let the venerable one stay as long as he likes."</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One entered the potter's workshop, prepared a
spread of grass at one end, and sat down, folding his legs crosswise,
setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness in front of him.
Then the Blessed One spent most of the night seated [in meditation],
and the venerable Pukkusati also spent most of the night seated [in
meditation]. Then the Blessed One thought: "This clansman conducts
himself in a way that inspires confidence. Suppose I were to question
him." So he asked the venerable Pukkusati:</P>
<P  >5.
"Under whom have you gone forth, bhikkhu? Who is your teacher?
Whose Dhamma do you profess?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1266anc" HREF="#sdendnote1266sym"><SUP>mcclxvi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Friend,
there is the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth
from a Sakyan clan. Now a good report of that Blessed Gotama has been
spread to this effect: 'That Blessed One</P>
<P  >is
accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.' I have
gone forth under that Blessed One; that Blessed One is my teacher; I
profess the Dhamma of that Blessed One."</P>
<P  >"But,
bhikkhu, where is that Blessed One, accomplished and fully
enlightened, now living?"</P>
<P  >"There
is, friend, a city in the northern country named Savatth-1. The
Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, is now living
there."</P>
<P  >"But,
bhikkhu, have you ever seen that Blessed One before? Would you
recognise him if you saw him?" [239]</P>
<P  >"No,
friend, I have never seen that Blessed One before, nor would I
recognise him if I saw him."</P>
<P  >6.
Then the Blessed One thought: "This clansman has gone forth from
the home life into homelessness under me. Suppose I were to teach him
the Dhamma." So the Blessed One addressed the venerable Pukkusati
thus: "Bhikkhu, I will teach you the Dhamma. Listen and attend
closely to what I shall say." - "Yes, friend," the venerable
Pukkusati replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >7.
"Bhikkhu, this person consists of six elements, six bases of
contact, and eighteen kinds of mental exploration, and he has four
foundations.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1267anc" HREF="#sdendnote1267sym"><SUP>mcclxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these
[foundations], and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over
him he is called a sage at peace. One should not neglect wisdom,
should preserve truth, should cultivate relinquishment, and should
train for peace. This is the summary of the exposition of the six
elements.</P>
<P  >8.
"'Bhikkhu, this person consists of six elements.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1268anc" HREF="#sdendnote1268sym"><SUP>mcclxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are
the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air
element, the space element, and the consciousness element. So it was
with reference to this that it was said: 'Bhikkhu, this person
consists of six elements.'</P>
<P  >9.
"'Bhikkhu, this person consists of six bases of contact.' So it
was said. And with reference to what was this said? There are the
base of eye-contact, the base of ear-contact, the base of
nosecontact, the base of tongue-contact, the base of body-contact,
and the base of mind-contact. So it was with reference to this that
it was said: 'Bhikkhu, this person consists of six bases of
contact.'</P>
<P  >10.
"'Bhikkhu, this person consists of eighteen kinds of mental
exploration.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1269anc" HREF="#sdendnote1269sym"><SUP>mcclxix</SUP></A></SUP>
So it was said. And with reference to what was this said? On seeing a
form with the eye, one explores a form productive of joy, one
explores a form productive of grief, one explores a form productive
of equanimity. On hearing a sound with the ear … [240] On smelling
an odour with the nose … On tasting a flavour with the tongue …
On touching a tangible with the body … On cognizing a mind-object
with the mind, one explores a mind-object productive of joy, one
explores a mind-object productive of grief, one explores a
mind-object productive of equanimity. So it was with reference to
this that it was said: 'Bhikkhu, this person consists of eighteen
kinds of mental exploration.'</P>
<P  >11.
"'Bhikkhu, this person has four foundations.' So it was said.
And with reference to what was this said? There are the foundation of
wisdom, the foundation of truth, the foundation of relinquishment,
and the foundation of peace.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1270anc" HREF="#sdendnote1270sym"><SUP>mcclxx</SUP></A></SUP>
So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'Bhikkhu, this
person has four foundations.'</P>
<P  >12.
"'One should not neglect wisdom, should preserve truth, should
cultivate relinquishment, and should train for peace.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1271anc" HREF="#sdendnote1271sym"><SUP>mcclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
So it was said. And with reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >13.
"How, bhikkhu, does one not neglect wisdom?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1272anc" HREF="#sdendnote1272sym"><SUP>mcclxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
There are these six elements: the earth element, the water element,
the fire element, the air element, the space element, and the
consciousness element.</P>
<P  >14.
"What, bhikkhu, is the earth element? The earth element may be
either internal or external. What is the internal earth element?
Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, and
clung-to, that is, head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,
sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen,
lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach,
feces, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is solid,
solidified, and clung-to: this is called the internal earth element.
Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element
are simply earth element. And that should be seen as it actually is
with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is
not my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the earth element and makes the
mind dispassionate towards the earth element.</P>
<P  >15.
"What, bhikkhu, is the water element? The water element may be
either [241] internal or external. What is the internal water
element? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery,
and clung-to, that is, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears,
grease, spittle, snot, oil-of-the-joints, urine, or whatever else
internally, belonging to oneself, is water, watery, and clung-to:
this is called the internal water element. Now both the internal
water element and the external water element are simply water
element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom
thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.'
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one
becomes disenchanted with the water element and makes the mind
dispassionate towards the water element.</P>
<P  >16.
"What, bhikkhu, is the fire element? The fire element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal fire element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is fire, fiery, and, clung-to, that
is, that by which one is warmed, ages, and is consumed, and that by
which what is eaten, drunk, consumed, and tasted gets completely
digested, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is fire,
fiery, and clung-to: this is called the internal fire element. Now
both the internal fire element and the external fire element are
simply fire element. And that should be seen as it actually is with
proper wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not
my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper
wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the fire element and makes the
mind dispassionate towards the fire element.</P>
<P  >17.
"What, bhikkhu, is the air element? The air element may be either
internal or external. What is the internal air element? Whatever
internally, belonging to oneself, is air, airy, and clungto, that is,
up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the belly, winds in the
bowels, winds that course through the limbs, in-breath and
out-breath, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is
air, airy, and clung-to: this is called the internal air element. Now
both the internal air element and the external air element are simply
air element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper
wisdom thus: 'This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my
self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom,
one becomes disenchanted with the air element and makes the mind
dispassionate towards the air element.</P>
<P  >18.
"What, bhikkhu, is the space element? The space element may be
either internal or external. What is the internal [242] space
element? Whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is space,
spatial, and clung-to, that is, the holes of the ears, the nostrils,
the door of the mouth, and that [aperture] whereby what is eaten,
drunk, consumed, and tasted gets swallowed, and where it collects,
and whereby it is excreted from below, or whatever else internally,
belonging to oneself, is space, spatial, and clung-to: this is called
the internal space element. Now both the internal space element and
the external space element are simply space element. And that should
be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: 'This is not
mine, this I am not, this is not my self.' When one sees it thus as
it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the
space element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the space
element.</P>
<P  >19.
"Then there remains only consciousness, purified and bright.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1273anc" HREF="#sdendnote1273sym"><SUP>mcclxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
What does one cognize with that consciousness? One cognizes: '[This
is] pleasant'; one cognizes: '[This is] painful'; one cognizes:
'[This is] neither-painful-nor-pleasant.' In dependence on a
contact to be felt as pleasant there arises a pleasant feeling.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1274anc" HREF="#sdendnote1274sym"><SUP>mcclxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
When one feels a pleasant feeling, one understands: 'I feel a
pleasant feeling.' One understands: 'With the cessation of that
same contact to be felt as pleasant, its corresponding feeling - the
pleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that contact to be felt
as pleasant - ceases and subsides.' In dependence on a contact to
be felt as painful there arises a painful feeling. When one feels a
painful feeling, one understands: 'I feel a painful feeling.' One
understands: 'With the cessation of that same contact to be felt as
painful, its corresponding feeling - the painful feeling that arose
in dependence on that contact to be felt as painful - ceases and
subsides.' In dependence on a contact to be felt as
neither-painful-nor-pleasant there arises a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. When one feels a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, one understands: 'I feel a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.' One understands: 'With the
cessation of that same contact to be felt as
neither-painfulnor-pleasant, its corresponding feeling - the
neither-painfulnor-pleasant feeling that arose in dependence on that
contact to be felt as neither-painful-nor-pleasant - ceases and
subsides.' Bhikkhu, just as from the contact and friction of two
fire-sticks</P>
<P  >heat
is generated and fire is produced, and with the separation and
disjunction of these two fire-sticks the corresponding heat ceases
and subsides; so too, [243] in dependence on a contact to be felt as
pleasant … to be felt as painful … to be felt as
neitherpainful-nor-pleasant there arises a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling … One understands: 'With the
cessation of that same contact to be felt as
neither-painful-nor-pleasant, its corresponding feeling … ceases
and subsides.'</P>
<P  >20.
"Then there remains only equanimity, purified and bright,
malleable, wieldy, and radiant.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1275anc" HREF="#sdendnote1275sym"><SUP>mcclxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
Suppose, bhikkhu, a skilled goldsmith or his apprentice were to
prepare a furnace, heat up the crucible, take some gold with tongs,
and put it into the crucible. From time to time he would blow on it,
from time to time he would sprinkle water over it, and from time to
time he would just look on. That gold would become refined, well
refined, completely refined, faultless, rid of dross, malleable,
wieldy, and radiant. Then whatever kind of ornament he wished to make
from it, whether a golden chain or earrings or a necklace or a golden
garland, it would serve his purpose. So too, bhikkhu, then there
remains only equanimity, purified and bright, malleable, wieldy, and
radiant.</P>
<P  >21.
"He understands thus: 'If I were to direct this equanimity, so
purified and bright, to the base of infinite space and to develop my
mind accordingly, then this equanimity of mine, supported by that
base, clinging to it, would remain for a very long time.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1276anc" HREF="#sdendnote1276sym"><SUP>mcclxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
If I were to direct this equanimity, so purified and bright, to the
base of infinite consciousness … [244] … to the base of
nothingness.. . to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
and to develop my mind accordingly, then this equanimity of mine,
supported by that base, clinging to it, would remain for a very long
time.'</P>
<P  >22
"He understands thus: 'If I were to direct this equanimity, so
purified and bright, to the base of infinite space and to develop my
mind accordingly, this would be conditioned.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1277anc" HREF="#sdendnote1277sym"><SUP>mcclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
If I were to direct this equanimity, so purified and bright, to the
base of infinite consciousness … to the base of nothingness … to
the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and to develop my
mind accordingly, this would be conditioned.' He does not form any
condition or generate any volition tending towards either being or
non-being.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1278anc" HREF="#sdendnote1278sym"><SUP>mcclxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Since he does not form any condition or generate any volition tending
towards either being or non-being, he does not cling to anything in
this world. When he does not cling, he is not agitated. When he is
not agitated, he personally attains Nibbana. He understands thus:
'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be
done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1279anc" HREF="#sdendnote1279sym"><SUP>mcclxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >23.
"If he feels a pleasant feeling,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1280anc" HREF="#sdendnote1280sym"><SUP>mcclxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
he understands: 'It is impermanent; there is no holding to it;
there is no delight in it.' If he feels a painful feeling, he
understands: 'It is impermanent; there is no holding to it; there
is no delight in it.' If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant
feeling, he understands: 'It is impermanent; there is no holding to
it; there is no delight in it.'</P>
<P  >24.
"If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels
a painful feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a
neitherpainful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached. When he
feels a feeling terminating with the body, he understands: 'I feel
a feeling terminating with the body.' [245] When he feels a feeling
terminating with life, he understands: 'I feel a feeling
terminating with life.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1281anc" HREF="#sdendnote1281sym"><SUP>mcclxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
He understands: 'On the dissolution of the body, with the ending of
life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool
right here.'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1282anc" HREF="#sdendnote1282sym"><SUP>mcclxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Bhikkhu, just as an oil-lamp burns in dependence on oil and a wick,
and when the oil and wick are used up, if it does not get any more
fuel, it is extinguished from lack of fuel; so too when he feels a
feeling terminating with the body … a feeling terminating with
life, he understands: 'I feel a feeling terminating with life.'
He understands: 'On the dissolution of the body, with the ending of
life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool
right here.'</P>
<P  >25.
"Therefore a bhikkhu possessing [this wisdom] possesses the supreme
foundation of wisdom. For this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble wisdom,
namely, the knowledge of the destruction of all suffering.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1283anc" HREF="#sdendnote1283sym"><SUP>mcclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >26.
"His deliverance, being founded upon truth, is unshakeable. For
that is false, bhikkhu, which has a deceptive nature, and that is
true which has an undeceptive nature - Nibbana. Therefore a bhikkhu
possessing [this truth] possesses the supreme foundation of truth.
For this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble truth, namely, Nibbana, which
has an undeceptive nature.</P>
<P  >27.
"Formerly, when he was ignorant, he acquired and developed
attachments;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1284anc" HREF="#sdendnote1284sym"><SUP>mcclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
now he has abandoned them, cut them off at the root, made them like a
palm stump, done away with them so that they are no longer subject to
future arising. Therefore a bhikkhu possessing [this relinquishment]
possesses the supreme foundation of relinquishment. For this,
bhikkhu, is the supreme noble relinquishment, namely, the
relinquishing of all attachments.</P>
<P  >28.
"Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced covetousness,
desire, and lust; now he has abandoned them, cut them off at the
root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so that they
are no longer subject to future arising. Formerly, when he was
ignorant, he experienced anger, ill will, and hate; now he has
abandoned them, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm
stump, done away with them so that they are no longer subject to
future arising. Formerly, when he was ignorant, he experienced
ignorance and delusion; now he has abandoned them, cut them off [246]
at the root, made them like a palm stump, done away with them so that
they are no longer subject to future arising. Therefore a bhikkhu
possessing [this peace] possesses the supreme foundation of peace.
For this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble peace, namely, the
pacification of lust, hate, and delusion.</P>
<P  >29.
"So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'One should
not neglect wisdom, should preserve truth, should cultivate
relinquishment, and should train for peace.'</P>
<P  >30.
"'The tides of conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon
these [foundations], and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep
over him he is called a sage at peace .'<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1285anc" HREF="#sdendnote1285sym"><SUP>mcclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
So it was said. And with reference to what was this said?</P>
<P  >31.
"Bhikkhu, 'I am' is a conceiving; 'I am this' is a
conceiving; 'I shall be' is a conceiving; 'I shall not be' is
a conceiving; 'I shall be possessed of form' is a conceiving; 'I
shall be formless' is a conceiving; 'I shall be percipient' is
a conceiving; 'I shall be nonpercipient' is a conceiving; 'I
shall be neither-percipient-nor-nonpercipient' is a conceiving.
Conceiving is a disease, conceiving is a tumour, conceiving is a
dart. By overcoming all conceivings, bhikkhu, one is called a sage at
peace. And the sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die;
he is not shaken and is not agitated. For there is nothing present in
him by which he might be born.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1286anc" HREF="#sdendnote1286sym"><SUP>mcclxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Not being born, how could he age? Not ageing, how could he die? Not
dying, how could he be shaken? Not being shaken, why should he be
agitated?</P>
<P  >32.
"So it was with reference to this that it was said: 'The tides of
conceiving do not sweep over one who stands upon these [foundations],
and when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over him he is
called a sage at peace.' Bhikkhu, bear in mind this brief
exposition of the six elements."</P>
<P  >33.
Thereupon the venerable Pukkusati thought: "Indeed, the Teacher has
come to me! The Sublime One has come to me! The Fully Enlightened One
has come to me!" Then he rose from his seat, arranged his upper
robe over one shoulder, and prostrating himself with his head at the
Blessed One's feet, he said: "Venerable sir, a transgression
overcame me, in that like a fool, confused [247] and blundering, I
presumed to address the Blessed One as 'friend.' Venerable sir,
may the Blessed One forgive my transgression seen as such for the
sake of restraint in the future."</P>
<P  >"Surely,
bhikkhu, a transgression overcame you, in that like a fool, confused
and blundering, you presumed to address me as 'friend.' But since
you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with
the Dhamma, we forgive you. For it is growth in the Noble One's
Discipline when one sees one's transgression as such, makes amends
in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes restraint in the
future."</P>
<P  >34.
"Venerable sir, I would receive the full admission under the
Blessed One."</P>
<P  >"But
are your bowl and robes complete, bhikkhu?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, my bowl and robes are not complete."</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhu,
Tathagatas do not give the full admission to anyone whose bowl and
robes are not complete."</P>
<P  >35.
Then the venerable Pukkusati, having delighted and rejoiced in the
Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to
the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed in order to
search for a bowl and robes. Then, while the venerable Pukkusati was
searching for a bowl and robes, a stray cow killed him.</P>
<P  >36.
Then a number of bhikkhus went to the Blessed One, and after paying
homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him: "Venerable
sir, the clansman Pukkusati, who was given</P>
<P  >brief
instruction by the Blessed One, has died. What is his destination?
What is his future course?"</P>
<P  >"Bhikkhus,
the clansman Pukkusati was wise. He practised in accordance with the
Dhamma and did not trouble me in the interpretation of the Dhamma.
With the destruction of the five lower fetters, the clansman
Pukkusati has reappeared spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and will
attain final Nibbana there without ever returning from that world."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1287anc" HREF="#sdendnote1287sym"><SUP>mcclxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
