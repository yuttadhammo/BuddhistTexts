24. Rathavinita Sutta - The Relay Chariots</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</P>
<P  >2.
Then a number of bhikkhus from [the Blessed One's] native land,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote285anc" HREF="#sdendnote285sym"><SUP>cclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP>
who had spent the Rains there, went to the Blessed One, and after
paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One asked
them: "Bhikkhus, who in [my] native land is esteemed by the
bhikkhus there, by his companions in the holy life, in this way:
'Having few wishes himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on fewness of
wishes; content himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on contentment;
secluded himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on seclusion; aloof from
society himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on aloofness from society;
energetic himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on arousing energy;
attained to virtue himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on the
attainment of virtue; attained to concentration himself, he talks to
the bhikkhus on the attainment of concentration; attained to wisdom
himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on the attainment of wisdom;
attained to deliverance himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on the
attainment of deliverance; attained to the knowledge and vision of
deliverance himself, he talks to the bhikkhus on the attainment of
the knowledge and vision of deliverance;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote286anc" HREF="#sdendnote286sym"><SUP>cclxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
he is one who advises, informs, instructs, urges, [146] rouses, and
encourages his companions in the holy life'?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, the venerable Punna Mantaniputta is so esteemed in the [Blessed
One's] native land by the bhikkhus there, by his companions in the
holy life."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote287anc" HREF="#sdendnote287sym"><SUP>cclxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >3.
Now on that occasion the venerable Sariputta was seated near the
Blessed One. Then it occurred to the venerable Sariputta: "It is a
gain for the venerable Punna Mantaniputta, it is a great gain for him
that his wise companions in the holy life praise him point by point
in the Teacher's presence. Perhaps sometime or other we might meet
the venerable Punna Mantaniputta and have some conversation with
him."</P>
<P  >4.
Then, when the Blessed One had stayed at Rajagaha as long as he
chose, he set out to wander by stages to Savatthi. Wandering by
stages, he eventually arrived at Savatthi, and there he lived in
Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >5.
The venerable Punna Mantaniputta heard: "The Blessed One has
arrived at Savatthi and is living in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's
Park." Then the venerable Punna Mantaniputta set his resting place
in order, and taking his outer robe and bowl, set out to wander by
stages to Savatthi. Wandering by stages, he eventually arrived at
Savatthi and went to Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park, to see
the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down
at one side and the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and
encouraged him with talk on the Dhamma. Then the venerable Punna
Mantaniputta, instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by the
Blessed One's talk on the Dhamma, delighting and rejoicing in the
Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to
the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he went to the Blind Men's
Grove for the day's abiding.</P>
<P  >6.
Then a certain bhikkhu went to the venerable Sariputta and said to
him: "Friend Sariputta, the bhikkhu Punna Mantaniputta of whom you
have always spoken highly [147] has just been instructed, urged,
roused, and encouraged by the Blessed One with talk on the Dhamma;
after delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One's words, he rose
from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping
him on his right, he has gone to the Blind Men's Grove for the
day's abiding."</P>
<P  >7.
Then the venerable Sariputta quickly picked up a mat and followed
close behind the venerable Punna Mantaniputta, keeping his head in
sight. Then the venerable Punna Mantaniputta entered the Blind Men's
Grove and sat down for the day's abiding at the root of a tree. The
venerable Sariputta also entered the Blind Men's Grove and sat down
for the day's abiding at the root of a tree.</P>
<P  >8.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Sariputta rose from
meditation, went to the venerable Punna Mantaniputta, and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said to the venerable Punna
Mantaniputta:</P>
<P  >9.
"Is the holy life lived under our Blessed One, friend?" - "Yes,
friend." - "But, friend, is it for the sake of purification of
virtue that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One?" - "No,
friend." - "Then is it for the sake of purification of mind that
the holy life is lived under the Blessed One?" - "No, friend."
- "Then is it for the sake of purification of view that the holy
life is lived under the Blessed One?" - "No, friend." - "Then
is it for the sake of purification by overcoming doubt that the holy
life is lived under the Blessed One?" - "No, friend." - "Then
is it for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of what is
the path and what is not the path that the holy life is lived under
the Blessed One?" - "No, friend." - "Then is it for the sake
of purification by knowledge and vision of the way that the holy life
is lived under the Blessed One?" - "No, friend." - "Then is
it for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision that the holy
life is lived under the Blessed One?" - "No, friend."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote288anc" HREF="#sdendnote288sym"><SUP>cclxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >10.
"Friend, when asked: 'But, friend, is it for the sake of
purification of virtue that the holy life is lived under the Blessed
One?' you replied: 'No, friend.' When asked: 'Then is it for
the sake of purification of mind … purification of view …
purification by overcoming doubt … purification by knowledge and
vision of what is the path and what is not the path … purification
by knowledge and vision of the way … purification by knowledge and
vision that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One?' you
replied: 'No, friend.' For the sake of what then, friend, [148]
is the holy life lived under the Blessed One?"</P>
<P  >"Friend,
it is for the sake of final Nibbana without clinging that the holy
life is lived under the Blessed One."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote289anc" HREF="#sdendnote289sym"><SUP>cclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
"But, friend, is purification of virtue final Nibbana without
clinging?" - "No, friend." - "Then is purification of mind
final Nibbana without clinging?" - "No, friend." - "Then is
purification of view final Nibbana without clinging?" - "No,
friend." - "Then is purification by overcoming doubt final
Nibbana without clinging?" - "No, friend." - "Then is
purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is
not the path final Nibbana without clinging?" - "No, friend." -
"Then is purification by knowledge and vision of the way final
Nibbana without clinging?" - "No, friend." - "Then is
purification by knowledge and vision final Nibbana without clinging?"
- "No, friend." - "But, friend, is final Nibbana without
clinging to be attained without these states?" - "No, friend."</P>
<P  >12.
"When asked: 'But, friend, is purification of virtue final
Nibbana without clinging?' you replied: 'No, friend.' When
asked: 'Then is purification of mind … purification of view …
purification by overcoming doubt … purification by knowledge and
vision of what is the path and what is not the path … purification
by knowledge and vision of the way … purification by knowledge and
vision final Nibbana without clinging?' you replied: 'No,
friend.' And when asked: 'But, friend, is final Nibbana without
clinging to be attained without these states?' you replied: 'No,
friend.' But how, friend, should the meaning of these statements be
regarded?"</P>
<P  >13.
"Friend, if the Blessed One had described purification of virtue as
final Nibbana without clinging, he would have described what is still
accompanied by clinging as final Nibbana without clinging. If the
Blessed One had described purification of mind … purification of
view … purification by overcoming doubt … purification by
knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path …
purification by knowledge and vision of the way … purification by
knowledge and vision as final Nibbana without clinging, he would have
described what is still accompanied by clinging as final Nibbana
without clinging.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote290anc" HREF="#sdendnote290sym"><SUP>ccxc</SUP></A></SUP>
And if final Nibbana without clinging were to be attained without
these states, then an ordinary person would have attained final
Nibbana, for an ordinary person is without these states.</P>
<P  >14.
"As to that, friend, I shall give you a simile, for some wise men
understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile. Suppose
that King Pasenadi of Kosala while living at Savatthi [149] had some
urgent business to settle at Saketa, and that between Savatthi and
Saketa seven relay chariots were kept ready for him. Then King
Pasenadi of Kosala, leaving Savatthi through the inner palace door,
would mount the first relay chariot, and by means of the first relay
chariot he would arrive at the second relay chariot; then he would
dismount from the first chariot and mount the second chariot, and by
means of the second chariot, he would arrive at the third chariot …
by means of the third chariot, he would arrive at the fourth chariot
… by means of the fourth chariot, he would arrive at the fifth
chariot … by means of the fifth chariot, he would arrive at the
sixth chariot … by means of the sixth chariot, he would arrive at
the seventh chariot, and by means of the seventh chariot he would
arrive at the inner palace door in Saketa. Then, when he had come to
the inner palace door, his friends and acquaintances, his kinsmen and
relatives, would ask him: 'Sire, did you come from Savatthi to the
inner palace door in Saketa by means of this relay chariot?' How
then should King Pasenadi of Kosala answer in order to answer
correctly?"</P>
<P  >"In
order to answer correctly, friend, he should answer thus: 'Here,
while living at Savatthi I had some urgent business to settle at
Saketa, and between Savatthi and Saketa seven relay chariots were
kept ready for me. Then, leaving Savatthi through the inner palace
door, I mounted the first relay chariot, and by means of the first
relay chariot I arrived at the second relay chariot; then I
dismounted from the first chariot and mounted the second chariot, and
by means of the second chariot I arrived at the third … fourth …
fifth … sixth … seventh chariot, and by means of the seventh
chariot I arrived at the inner palace door in Saketa.' In order to
answer correctly he should answer thus."</P>
<P  >15.
"So too, friend, purification of virtue is for the sake of reaching
purification of mind; purification of mind is for the sake of
reaching purification of view; purification of view is for the sake
of reaching purification by overcoming doubt; purification by
overcoming doubt [150] is for the sake of reaching purification by
knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path;
purification by knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is
not the path is for the sake of reaching purification by knowledge
and vision of the way; purification by knowledge and vision of the
way is for the sake of reaching purification by knowledge and vision;
purification by knowledge and vision is for the sake of reaching
final Nibbana without clinging. It is for the sake of final Nibbana
without clinging that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One."</P>
<P  >16.
When this was said, the venerable Sariputta asked the venerable Punna
Mantaniputta: "What is the venerable one's name, and how do his
companions in the holy life know the venerable one?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote291anc" HREF="#sdendnote291sym"><SUP>ccxci</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"My
name is Punna, friend, and my companions in the holy life know me as
Mantaniputta."</P>
<P  >"It
is wonderful, friend, it is marvellous! Each profound question has
been answered, point by point, by the venerable Punna Mantaniputta as
a learned disciple who understands the Teacher's Dispensation
correctly. It is a gain for his companions in the holy life, it is a
great gain for them that they have the opportunity to see and honour
the venerable Punna Mantaniputta. Even if it were by carrying the
venerable Punna Mantaniputta about on a cushion on their heads that
his companions in the holy life would get the opportunity to see and
honour him, it would be a gain for them, a great gain for them. And
it is a gain for us, a great gain for us that we have the opportunity
to see and honour the venerable Punna Mantaniputta."</P>
<P  >17.
When this was said, the venerable Punna Mantaniputta asked the
venerable Sariputta: "What is the venerable one's name, and how
do his companions in the holy life know the venerable one?"</P>
<P  >"My
name is Upatissa, friend, and my companions in the holy life know me
as Sariputta."</P>
<P  >"Indeed,
friend, we did not know that we were talking with the venerable
Sariputta, the disciple who is like the Teacher himself.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote292anc" HREF="#sdendnote292sym"><SUP>ccxcii</SUP></A></SUP>
If we had known that this was the venerable Sariputta, we should not
have said so much. It is wonderful, friend, it is marvellous! Each
profound question has been posed, point by point, by the venerable
Sariputta as a learned disciple who understands the Teacher's
Dispensation correctly. It is a gain for his companions in the holy
life, it is a great gain for them that they have the opportunity to
see and honour the venerable Sariputta. Even if it were by carrying
the venerable Sariputta about on a cushion on their heads that his
companions in the holy life would get the opportunity to see and
honour him, [151] it would be a gain for them, a great gain for them.
And it is a gain for us, a great gain for us that we have the
opportunity to see and honour the venerable Sariputta."</P>
<P  >Thus
it was that these two great beings rejoiced in each other's good
words.</P>
