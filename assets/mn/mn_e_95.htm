95. Canki Sutta - With Canki</H2>
<P  >[164]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote880anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote880sym"><SUP>dccclxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering in the Kosalan country
with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, and eventually he arrived at a
Kosalan brahmin village named Opasada. There the Blessed One stayed
in the Gods' Grove,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote881anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote881sym"><SUP>dccclxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
the Sala-tree Grove to the north of Opasada.</P>
<P  >2.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Canki was ruling over Opasada, a
crown property abounding in living beings, rich in grasslands,
woodlands, waterways, and grain, a royal endowment, a sacred grant
given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala.</P>
<P  >3.
The brahmin householders of Opasada heard: "The recluse Gotama ...
(as Sutta 91, ยง3) ... Now it is good see such arahants."</P>
<P  >4.
Then the brahmin householders of Opasada set forth from Opasada in
groups and bands and headed northwards to the Gods' Grove, the
Sala-tree Grove.</P>
<P  >5.
Now on that occasion the brahmin Canki had retired to the upper
storey of his palace for his midday rest. Then he saw the brahmin
householders of Opasada setting forth from Opasada in groups and
bands and heading northwards to the Gods' Grove, the Sala-tree
Grove. When he saw them, he asked his minister: "Good minister, why
are the brahmin householders of Opasada setting forth from Opasada in
groups and bands and heading northwards to the Gods' Grove, the
Sala-tree Grove?"</P>
<P  >6.
"Sir, there is the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went
forth from a Sakyan clan, who has been wandering in the Kosalan
country ... (as Sutta 91, ยง3) ... They are going to see that Master
Gotama."</P>
<P  >"Then,
good minister, go to the brahmin householders of Opasada and tell
them: 'Sirs, the brahmin Canki says this: "Please wait, sirs. The
brahmin Canki will also go to see the recluse Gotama.""</P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," the minister replied, [165] and he went to the brahmin
householders of Opasada and gave them the message.</P>
<P  >7.
Now on that occasion five hundred brahmins from various states were
staying at Opasada for some business or other. They heard: "The
brahmin Cankl., it is said, is going to see the recluse Gotama."
Then they went to the brahmin Canki and asked him: "Sir, is it true
that you are going to see the recluse Gotama?"</P>
<P  >"So
it is, sirs. I am going to see the recluse Gotama."</P>
<P  >8.
"Sir, do not go to see the recluse Gotama. It is not proper, Master
Canki, for you to go to see the recluse Gotama; rather, it is proper
for the recluse Gotama to come to see you. For you, sir, are well
born on both sides, of pure maternal and paternal descent seven
generations back, unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth.
Since that is so, Master Canki, it is not proper for you to go to see
the recluse Gotama; rather, it is proper for the recluse Gotama to
come to see you. You, sir, are rich, with great wealth and great
possessions. You, sir, are a master of the Three Vedas with their
vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as
a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, you are fully versed in
natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. You, sir, are
handsome, comely, and graceful, possessing supreme beauty of
complexion, with sublime beauty and sublime presence, remarkable to
behold. You, sir, are virtuous, mature in virtue, possessing mature
virtue. You, sir, are a good speaker with a good delivery; [166] you
speak words that are courteous, distinct, flawless, and communicate
the meaning. You, sir, teach the teachers of many, and you teach the
recitation of the hymns to three hundred brahmin students. You, sir,
are honoured, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King
Pasenadi of Kosala. You, sir, are honoured, respected, revered,
venerated, and esteemed by the brahmin Pokkharasati.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote882anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote882sym"><SUP>dccclxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
You, sir, rule over Opasada, a crown property abounding in living
beings ... a sacred grant given to you by King Pasenadi of Kosala.
Since this is so, Master Canki, it is not proper for you to go to see
the recluse Gotama; rather, it is proper for the recluse Gotama to
come to see you."</P>
<P  >9.
When this was said, the brahmin Canki told those Brahmins: "Now,
sirs, hear from me why it is proper for me to go to see Master
Gotama, and why it is not proper for Master Gotama to come to see me.
Sirs, the recluse Gotama is well born on both sides, of pure maternal
and paternal descent seven generations back, unassailable and
impeccable in respect of birth. Since this is so, sirs, it is not
proper for Master Gotama to come to see me; rather, it is proper for
me to go to see Master Gotama. Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth
abandoning much gold and bullion stored away in vaults and
depositories. Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth from the home life
into homelessness while still young, a black-haired young man endowed
with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life. Sirs, the recluse
Gotama shaved off his hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and
went forth from the home life into homelessness though his mother and
father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces. Sirs, the
recluse Gotama is handsome, comely, and graceful, possessing supreme
beauty of complexion, [167] with sublime beauty and sublime presence,
remarkable to behold. Sirs, the recluse Gotama is virtuous, with
noble virtue, with wholesome virtue, possessing wholesome virtue.
Sirs, the recluse Gotama is a good speaker with a good delivery; he
speaks words that are courteous, distinct, flawless, and communicate
the meaning. Sirs, the recluse Gotama is a teacher of the teachers of
many. Sirs, the recluse Gotama is free from sensual lust and without
personal vanity. Sirs, the recluse Gotama holds the doctrine of the
moral efficacy of action, the doctrine of the moral efficacy of
deeds; he does not seek any harm for the line of brahmins. Sirs, the
recluse Gotama went forth from an aristocratic family, from one of
the original noble families. Sirs, the recluse Gotama went forth from
a rich family, from a family of great wealth and great possessions.
Sirs, people come from remote kingdoms and remote districts to
question the recluse Gotama. Sirs, many thousands of deities have
gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama. Sirs, a good report
of the recluse Gotama has been spread to this effect: 'That Blessed
One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and
conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to
be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.' Sirs,
the recluse Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks of a Great Man.
Sirs, King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha and his wife and children have
gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama. Sirs, King Pasenadi
of Kosala and his wife and children have gone for refuge for life to
the recluse Gotama. Sirs, the brahmin Pokkharasati and his wife and
children have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama. Sirs,
the recluse Gotama has arrived at Opasada and is living at Opasada in
the Gods' Grove, the Sala-tree Grove to the north of Opasada. Now
any recluses or brahmins that come to our town are our guests, and
guests should be honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by us.
Since the recluse Gotama has arrived at Opasada, he is our guest, and
as our guest should be honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by
us. [168] Since this is so, sirs, it is not proper for Master Gotama
to come to see me; rather, it is proper for me to go to see Master
Gotama.</P>
<P  >"Sirs,
this much is the praise of Master Gotama that I have learned, but the
praise of Master Gotama is not limited to that, for the praise of
Master Gotama is immeasurable. Since Master Gotama possesses each one
of these factors, it is not proper for him to come to see me; rather,
it is proper for me to go to see Master Gotama. Therefore, sirs, let
all of us go to see the recluse Gotama."</P>
<P  >10.
Then the brahmin Canki, together with a large company of brahmins,
went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this
courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side.</P>
<P  >11.
Now on that occasion the Blessed One was seated finishing some
amiable talk with some very senior brahmins. At the time, sitting in
the assembly, was a brahmin student named Kapathika. Young,
shaven-headed, sixteen years old, he was a master of the Three Vedas
with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the
histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he was fully
versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. While
the very senior brahmins were conversing with the Blessed One, he
often broke in and interrupted their talk. Then the Blessed One
rebuked the brahmin student Kapathika thus: "Let not the venerable
Bharadvaja break in and interrupt the talk of the very senior
brahmins while they are conversing. Let the venerable Bharadvaja wait
until the talk is finished."</P>
<P  >When
this was said, the brahmin Canki said to the Blessed One: "Let not
Master Gotama rebuke the brahmin student Kapathika. The brahmin
student Kapathika is a clansman, he is very learned, he has a good
delivery, he is wise; he is capable of taking part in this discussion
with Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >12.
Then the Blessed One thought: "Surely, [169] since the brahmins
honour him thus, the brahmin student Kapathika must be accomplished
in the scriptures of the Three Vedas."</P>
<P  >Then
the brahmin student Kapathika thought: "When the recluse Gotama
catches my eye, I shall ask him a question."</P>
<P  >Then,
knowing with his own mind the thought in the brahmin student
Kapathika's mind, the Blessed One turned his eye towards him. Then
the brahmin student Kapathika thought: "The recluse Gotama has
turned towards me. Suppose I ask him a question." Then he said to
the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, in regard to the ancient brahmanic
hymns that have come down through oral transmission and in the
scriptural collections, the brahmins come to the definite conclusion:
'Only this is true, anything else is wrong.' What does Master
Gotama say about this?"</P>
<P  >13.
"How then, Bharadvaja, among the brahmins is there even a single
brahmin who says thus: 'I know this, I see this: only this is true,
anything else is wrong'?" - "No, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"How
then, Bharadvaja, among the brahmins is there even a single teacher
or a single teacher's teacher back to the seventh generation of
teachers who says thus: I know this, I see this: only this is true,
anything else is wrong'?" - "No, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"How
then, Bharadvaja, the ancient brahmin seers, the creators of the
hymns, the composers of the hymns, whose ancient hymns that were
formerly chanted, uttered, and compiled, the brahmins nowadays still
chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken and reciting what was
recited - that is, Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi,
Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote883anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote883sym"><SUP>dccclxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP>
- did even these ancient brahmin. seers say thus: 'We know this, we
see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong'?" - [170]
"No, Master Gotama."</P>
<P  >"So,
Bharadvaja, it seems that among the brahmins there is not even a
single brahmin who says thus: 'I know this, I see this: only this
is true, anything else is wrong.' And among the brahmins there is
not even a single teacher or a single teacher's teacher back to the
seventh generation of teachers, who says thus: 'I know this, I see
this: only this is true, anything else is wrong.' And the ancient
brahmin seers, the creators of the hymns, the composers of the hymns
... even these ancient brahmin seers did not say thus: 'We know
this, we see this: only this is true, anything else is wrong.'
Suppose there were a file of blind men each in touch with the next:
the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last
one does not see. So too, Bharadvaja, in regard to their statement
the brahmins seem to be like a file of blind men: the first one does
not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see.
What do you think, Bharadvaja, that being so, does not the faith of
the brahmins turn out to be groundless?"</P>
<P  >14.
"The brahmins honour this not only out of faith, Master Gotama.
They also honour it as oral tradition."</P>
<P  >"Bharadvaja,
first you took your stand on faith, now you speak of oral tradition.
There are five things, Bharadvaja, that may turn out in two different
ways here and now. What five? Faith, approval, oral tradition,
reasoned cogitation, and reflective acceptance of a view.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote884anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote884sym"><SUP>dccclxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
These five things may turn out in two different ways here and now.
Now something may be fully accepted out of faith, yet it may be
empty, hollow, and false; but something else may not be fully
accepted out of faith, yet it may be factual, true, and unmistaken.
Again, [171] something may be fully approved of ... may be well
cogitated ... may be well reflected upon, yet it may be empty,
hollow, and false; but something else may not be well reflected upon,
yet it may be factual, true, and unmistaken. [Under these conditions]
it is not proper for a wise man who preserves truth to come to the
definite conclusion: 'Only this is true, anything else is wrong."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote885anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote885sym"><SUP>dccclxxxv</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >15.
"But, Master Gotama, in what way is there the preservation of
truth?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote886anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote886sym"><SUP>dccclxxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
How does one preserve truth? We ask Master Gotama about the
preservation of truth."</P>
<P  >"If
a person has faith, Bharadvaja, he preserves truth when he says: 'My
faith is thus'; but he does not yet come to the definite
conclusion: 'Only this is true, anything else is wrong.' In this
way, Bharadvaja, there is the preservation of truth; in this way he
preserves truth; in this way we describe the preservation of truth.
But as yet there is no discovery of truth.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote887anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote887sym"><SUP>dccclxxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"If
a person approves of something ... if he receives an oral tradition ...
if he [reaches a conclusion based on] reasoned cogitation. . .if he
gains a reflective acceptance of a view, he preserves truth when he
says: 'My reflective acceptance of a view is thus'; but he does
not yet come to the definite conclusion: 'Only this is true,
anything else is wrong.' In this way too, Bharadvaja, there is the
preservation of truth; in this way he preserves truth; in this way we
describe the preservation of truth. But as yet there is no discovery
of truth."</P>
<P  >16.
"In that way, Master Gotama, there is the preservation of truth; in
that way one preserves truth; in that way we recognise the
preservation of truth. But in what way, Master Gotama, is there the
discovery of truth? In what way does one discover truth? We ask
Master Gotama about the discovery of truth."</P>
<P  >17.
"Here, Bharadvaja, a bhikkhu may be living in dependence on some
village or town.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote888anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote888sym"><SUP>dccclxxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then a householder or a householder's son goes to him and
investigates him in regard to three kinds of states: [172] in regard
to states based on greed, in regard to states based on hate, and in
regard to states based on delusion: 'Are there in this venerable
one any states based on greed such that, with his mind obsessed by
those states, while not knowing he might say, "I know," or while
not seeing he might say, "I see," or he might urge others to act
in a way that would lead to their harm and suffering for a long
time?' As he investigates him he comes to know: 'There are no
such states based on greed in this venerable one. The bodily
behaviour and the verbal behaviour of this venerable one are not
those of one affected by greed. And the Dhamma that this venerable
one teaches is profound, hard to see and hard to understand, peaceful
and sublime, unattainable by mere reasoning, subtle, to be
experienced by the wise. This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one
affected by greed.'</P>
<P  >18.
"When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from
states based on greed, he next investigates him in regard to states
based on hate: 'Are there in this venerable one any states based on
hate such that, with his mind obsessed by those states ... he might
urge others to act in a way that would lead to their harm and
suffering for a long time?' As he investigates him, he comes to
know: 'There are no such states based on hate in this venerable
one. The bodily behaviour and the verbal behaviour of this venerable
one are not those of one affected by hate. And the Dhamma that this
venerable one teaches is profound.. .to be experienced by the wise.
This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one affected by hate.'</P>
<P  >19.
"When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from
states based on hate, [173] he next investigates him in regard to
states based on delusion: 'Are there in this venerable one any
states based on delusion such that, with his mind obsessed by those
states ... h.e might urge others to act in a way that would lead to
their harm and suffering for a long time?' As he investigates him,
he comes to know: 'There are no such states based on delusion in
this venerable one. The bodily behaviour and the verbal behaviour of
this venerable one are not those of one affected by delusion. And the
Dhamma that this venerable one teaches is profound ... to be
experienced by the wise. This Dhamma cannot easily be taught by one
affected by delusion.'</P>
<P  >20.
"When he has investigated him and has seen that he is purified from
states based on delusion, then he places faith in him; filled with
faith he visits him and pays respect to him; having paid respect to
him, he gives ear; when he gives ear, he hears the Dhamma; having
heard the Dhamma, he memorises it and examines the meaning of the
teachings he has memorised; when he examines their meaning, he gains
a reflective acceptance of those teachings; when he has gained a
reflective acceptance of those teachings, zeal springs up; when zeal
has sprung up, he applies his will; having applied his will, he
scrutinises;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote889anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote889sym"><SUP>dccclxxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
having scrutinised, he strives;<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote890anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote890sym"><SUP>dcccxc</SUP></A></SUP>
resolutely striving, he realises with the body the ultimate truth and
sees it by penetrating it with wisdom.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote891anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote891sym"><SUP>dcccxci</SUP></A></SUP>
In this way, Bharadvaja, there is the discovery of truth; in this way
one discovers truth; in this way we describe the discovery of truth.
But as yet there is no final arrival at truth."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote892anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote892sym"><SUP>dcccxcii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >21.
"In that way, Master Gotama, there is the discovery of truth; in
that way one discovers truth; in that way we recognise the discovery
of truth. But in what way, Master Gotama, is there the final arrival
at truth? In what way does one finally arrive at truth? We ask Master
Gotama about the final arrival at truth." [174]</P>
<P  >"The
final arrival at truth, Bharadvaja, lies in the repetition,
development, and cultivation of those same things. In this way,
Bharadvaja, there is the final arrival at truth; in this way one
finally arrives at truth; in this way we describe the final arrival
at truth."</P>
<P  >22.
"In that way, Master Gotama, there is the final arrival at truth;
in that way one finally arrives at truth; in that way we recognise
the final arrival at truth. But what, Master Gotama, is most helpful
for the final arrival at truth? We ask Master Gotama about the thing
most helpful for the final arrival at truth."</P>
<P  >"Striving
is most helpful for the final arrival at truth, Bharadvaja. If one
does not strive, one will not finally arrive at truth; but because
one strives, one does finally arrive at truth. That is why striving
is most helpful for the final arrival at truth."</P>
<P  >23.
"But what, Master Gotama, is most helpful for striving? We ask
Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for striving."</P>

<P  >"Zeal

<P  >26.
"But what, Master Gotama, is most helpful for zeal? [175] We ask
Master Gotama about the thing most helpful for zeal."</P>
<P  >"A
