13. Mahadukkhakkhandha Sutta - The Greater Discourse<BR>on the Mass
of Suffering</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, a number of bhikkhus dressed, and taking
their bowls and outer robes, [84] went into Savatthi for alms. Then
they thought: "It is still too early to wander for alms in
Savatthi. Suppose we went to the park of the wanderers of other
sects." So they went to the park of the wanderers of other sects
and exchanged greetings with the wanderers. When this courteous and
amiable talk was finished, they sat down at one side. The wanderers
said to them:</P>
<P  >3.
"Friends, the recluse Gotama describes the full understanding of
sensual pleasures, and we do so too; the recluse Gotama describes the
full understanding of material form, and we do so too; the recluse
Gotama describes the full understanding of feelings, and we do so
too. What then is the distinction here, friends, what is the
variance, what is the difference between the recluse Gotama's
teaching of the Dhamma and ours, between his instructions and ours?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote200anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote200sym"><SUP>cc</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >4.
Then those bhikkhus neither approved nor disapproved of the
wanderers' words. Without doing either they rose from their seats
and went away, thinking: "We shall come to understand the meaning
of these words in the Blessed One's presence."</P>
<P  >5.
When they had wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from
their almsround, after the meal they went to the Blessed One, and
after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him
what had taken place. [The Blessed One said:] [85]</P>
<P  >6.
"Bhikkhus, wanderers of other sects who speak thus should be
questioned thus: 'But, friends, what is the gratification, what is
the danger, and what is the escape in the case of sensual pleasures?
What is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape
in the case of material form? What is the gratification, what is the
danger, and what is the escape in the case of feelings?' Being
questioned thus, wanderers of other sects will fail to account for
the matter, and what is more, they will get into difficulties. Why is
that? Because it is not their province. Bhikkhus, I see no one in the
world with its gods, its Maras, and its Brahmas, in this generation
with its recluses and brahmins, with its princes and its people, who
could satisfy the mind with a reply to these questions, except for
the Tathagata or his disciple or one who has learned it from them.</P>
<H3 >(SENSUAL PLEASURES)</H3>
<P  >7.
(i) "And what, bhikkhus, is the gratification in the case of
sensual pleasures? Bhikkhus, there are these five cords of sensual
pleasure. What are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are
wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual
desire, and provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear ...
Odours cognizable by the nose ... Flavours cognizable by the tongue ...
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.
Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of
sensual pleasure are the gratification in the case of sensual
pleasures.</P>
<P  >8.
(ii) "And what, bhikkhus, is the danger in the case of sensual
pleasures? Here, bhikkhus, on account of the craft by which a
clansman makes a living - whether checking or accounting or
calculating or farming or trading or husbandry or archery or the
royal service, or whatever craft it may be - he has to face cold, he
has to face heat, he is injured by contact with gadflies, mosquitoes,
wind, sun, and creeping things; he risks death by hunger and thirst.
Now this is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of
suffering visible here and now, having sensual pleasures as its
cause, sensual pleasures as its source, sensual pleasures as its
basis, [86] the cause being simply sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >9.
"If no property comes to the clansman while he works and strives
and makes an effort thus, he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps
beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying: 'My work is in
vain, my effort is fruitless!' Now this too is a danger in the case
of sensual pleasures ... the cause being simply sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >10.
"If property comes to the clansman while he works and strives and
makes an effort thus, he experiences pain and grief in protecting it:
'How shall neither kings nor thieves make off with my property, nor
fire burn it, nor water sweep it away, nor hateful heirs make off
with it?' And as he guards and protects his property, kings or
thieves make off with it, or fire burns it, or water sweeps it away,
or hateful heirs make off with it. And he sorrows, grieves, and
laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying:
'What I had I have no longer!' Now this too is a danger in the
case of sensual pleasures ... the cause being simply sensual
pleasures.</P>
<P  >11.
"Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as
the source, sensual pleasures as the basis, the cause being simply
sensual pleasures, kings quarrel with kings, nobles with nobles,
brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders; mother
quarrels with child, child with mother, father with child, child with
father; brother quarrels with brother, brother with sister, sister
with brother, friend with friend. And here in their quarrels, brawls,
and disputes they attack each other with fists, clods, sticks, or
knives, whereby they incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too is
a danger in the case of sensual pleasures ... the cause being simply
sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >12.
"Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... men take swords and
shields and buckle on bows and quivers, and they charge into battle
massed in double array with arrows and spears flying and swords
flashing; and there they are wounded by arrows and spears, and their
heads are cut off by swords, whereby they incur death or deadly
suffering. Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasures
... the cause being simply sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >13.
"Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... men take swords and
shields and buckle on bows and quivers, and they charge slippery
bastions, with arrows and spears flying [87] and swords flashing; and
there they are wounded by arrows</P>
<P  >and
spears and splashed with boiling liquids and crushed under heavy
weights, and their heads are cut off by swords, whereby they incur
death or deadly suffering. Now this too is a danger in the case of
sensual pleasures ... the cause being simply sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >14.
"Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... men break into
houses, plunder wealth, commit burglary, ambush highways, seduce
others' wives, and when they are caught, kings have many kinds of
torture inflicted on them. The kings have them flogged with whips,
beaten with canes, beaten with clubs; they have their hands cut off,
their feet cut off, their hands and feet cut off; their ears cut off,
their noses cut off, their ears and noses cut off; they have them
subjected to the 'porridge pot,' to the 'polished-shell shave,'
to the 'Rahu's mouth,' to the 'fiery wreath,' to the
'flaming hand,' to the 'blades of grass,' to the 'bark
dress,' to the 'antelope,' to the 'meat hooks,' to the
'coins,' to the 'lye pickling,' to the 'pivoting pin,' to
the 'rolled-up palliasse';<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote201anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote201sym"><SUP>cci</SUP></A></SUP>
and they have them splashed with boiling oil, and they have them
thrown to be devoured by dogs, and they have them impaled alive on
stakes, and they have their heads cut off with swords - whereby they
incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too is a danger in the case
of sensual pleasures ... the cause being simply sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >15.
"Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as
the source, sensual pleasures as the basis, the cause being simply
sensual pleasures, people indulge in misconduct of body, speech, and
mind. Having done so, on the dissolution of the body, after death,
they reappear in states of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in
perdition, even in hell. Now this too is a danger in the case of
sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering in the life to come,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote202anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote202sym"><SUP>ccii</SUP></A></SUP>
having sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures as its
source, sensual pleasures as its basis, the cause being simply
sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >16.
(iii) "And what, bhikkhus, is the escape in the case of sensual
pleasures? It is the removal of desire and lust, the abandonment of
desire and lust for sensual pleasures.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote203anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote203sym"><SUP>cciii</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the escape in the case of sensual pleasures.</P>
<P  >17.
"That those recluses and brahmins who do not understand as it
actually is the gratification as gratification, the danger as danger,
and the escape as escape in the case of sensual pleasures, can either
themselves fully understand sensual pleasures or instruct another so
that he can fully understand sensual pleasures - that is impossible.
That those recluses and brahmins who understand as it actually is
[88] the gratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and
the escape as escape in the case of sensual pleasures, can either
themselves fully understand sensual pleasures or instruct another so
that he can fully understand sensual pleasures - that is possible.</P>
<H3 >(MATERIAL FORM)</H3>
<P  >18.
(i) "And what, bhikkhus, is the gratification in the case of
material form? Suppose there were a girl of the noble class or the
brahmin class or of householder stock, in her fifteenth or sixteenth
year, neither too tall nor too short, neither too thin nor too fat,
neither too dark nor too fair. Is her beauty and loveliness then at
its height?" - "Yes, venerable sir." - "Now the pleasure and
joy that arise in dependence on that beauty and loveliness are the
gratification in the case of material form.</P>
<P  >19.
(ii) "And what, bhikkhus, is the danger in the case of material
form? Later on one might see that same woman here at eighty, ninety,
or a hundred years, aged, as crooked as a roof bracket, doubled up,
supported by a walking stick, tottering, frail, her youth gone, her
teeth broken, grey-haired, scantyhaired, bald, wrinkled, with limbs
all blotchy. What do you think, bhikkhus? Has her former beauty and
loveliness vanished and the danger become evident?" - "Yes,
venerable sir." - "Bhikkhus, this is a danger in the case of
material form.</P>
<P  >20.
"Again, one might see that same woman afflicted, suffering, and
gravely ill, lying fouled in her own excrement and urine, lifted up
by some and set down by others. What do you think, bhikkhus? Has her
former beauty and loveliness vanished and the danger become evident?"
- "Yes, venerable sir." - "Bhikkhus, this too is a danger in
the case of material form.</P>
<P  >21.
"Again, one might see that same woman as a corpse thrown aside in a
charnel ground, one, two, or three days dead, bloated, livid, and
oozing matter. What do you think, bhikkhus? Has her former beauty and
loveliness vanished and the danger become evident?" - "Yes,
venerable sir." - "Bhikkhus, this too is a danger in the case of
material form.</P>
<P  >22-29.
"Again, one might see that same woman as a corpse thrown aside in a
charnel ground, being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs,
jackals, or various kinds of worms ... [89] ... a skeleton with flesh
and blood, held together with sinews ... a fleshless skeleton smeared
with blood, held together with sinews ... disconnected bones
scattered in all directions - here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone,
here a thigh-bone, there a ribbone, here a hip-bone, there a
back-bone, here the skull ... bones bleached white, the colour of
shells ... bones heaped up, more than a year old ... bones rotted and
crumbled to dust. What do you think, bhikkhus? Has her former beauty
and loveliness vanished and the danger become evident?" - "Yes,
venerable sir." - "Bhikkhus, this too is a danger in the case of
material form.</P>
<P  >30.
(iii) "And what, bhikkhus, is the escape in the case of material
form? It is the removal of desire and lust, the abandonment of desire
and lust for material form. This is the escape in the case of
material form.</P>
<P  >31.
"That those recluses and brahmins who do not understand as it
actually is the gratification as gratification, the danger as danger,
and the escape as escape in the case of material form, can either
themselves fully understand material form or instruct another so that
he can fully understand material form - that is impossible. That
those recluses and brahmins who understand as it actually is the
gratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape
as escape in the case of material form, can either themselves fully
understand material form or instruct another so that he can fully
understand material form - that is possible.</P>
<H3 >(FEELINGS)</H3>
<P  >32.
(i) "And what, bhikkhus, is the gratification in the case of
feelings? Here, bhikkhus, quite secluded from sensual pleasures,
secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in
the first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote204anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote204sym"><SUP>cciv</SUP></A></SUP>
On such an occasion he does not choose for his own affliction, or for
another's affliction, or for the affliction of both. [90] On that
occasion he feels only feeling that is free from affliction. The
highest gratification in the case of feelings is freedom from
affliction, say.</P>
<P  >33-35.
"Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana ... With the
fading away as well of rapture ... he enters upon and abides in the
third jhana ... With the abandoning of pleasure and pain he enters
upon and abides in the fourth jhana ... On such an occasion he does
not choose for his own affliction, or for another's affliction, or
for the affliction of both. On that occasion he feels only feeling
that is free from affliction. The highest gratification in the case
of feelings is freedom from affliction, I say.</P>
<P  >36.
(ii) "And what, bhikkhus, is the danger in the case of feelings?
Feelings are impermanent, suffering, and subject to change. This is
the danger in the case of feelings.</P>
<P  >37.
(iii) "And what, bhikkhus, is the escape in the case of feelings?
It is the removal of desire and lust, the abandonment of desire and
lust for feelings. This is the escape in the case of feelings.</P>
<P  >38.
"That those recluses and brahmins who do not understand as it
actually is the gratification as gratification, the danger as danger,
and the escape as escape in the case of feelings, can either
themselves fully understand feelings or instruct another so that he
can fully understand feelings - that is impossible. That those
recluses and brahmins who understand as it actually is the
gratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape
as escape in the case of feelings, can either themselves fully
understand feelings or instruct another so that he can fully
understand feelings - that is possible."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
