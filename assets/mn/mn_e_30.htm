30. Culasaropama Sutta - The Shorter Discourse on the Simile of the
Heartwood</H2>
<P  >[198]
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then the brahmin Pingalakoccha went to the Blessed One and exchanged
greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was
finished, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P  >"Master
Gotama, there are these recluses and brahmins, each the head of an
order, the head of a group, the teacher of a group, a well-known and
famous founder of a sect regarded by many as a saint - that is,
Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambalin, Pakudha
Kaccayana, Sanjaya Belatthiputta, and the Nigantha Nataputta.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote350anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote350sym"><SUP>cccl</SUP></A></SUP>
Have they all had direct knowledge as they claim, or have none of
them had direct knowledge, or have some of them had direct knowledge
and some not?"</P>
<P  >"Enough,
brahmin! Let this be! - 'Have they all had direct knowledge as they
claim, or have none of them had direct knowledge, or have some of
them had direct knowledge and some not?' I shall teach you the
Dhamma, brahmin. Listen and attend closely to what I shall say."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote351anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote351sym"><SUP>cccli</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Yes,
sir," the brahmin Pingalakoccha replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >3.
"Suppose, brahmin, a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood,
wandering in search of heartwood, came to a great tree standing
possessed of heartwood. Passing over its heartwood, its sapwood, its
inner bark, and its outer bark, he would cut off its twigs and leaves
and take them away thinking they were heartwood. Then a man with good
sight, seeing him, might say: 'This good man did not know the
heartwood, the sapwood, the inner bark, the outer bark, or the twigs
and leaves.</P>
<P  >Thus,
while needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood, he came to a great tree standing possessed of heartwood,
and passing over its heartwood, its sapwood, its inner bark, and its
outer bark, he cut off its twigs and leaves and took them away
thinking they were heartwood. Whatever it was this good man had to
make with heartwood, his purpose will not be served.'</P>

"So too, brahmin, here some clansman goes forth out of faith from
the home life into homelessness, considering: 'I am a victim of
birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair; I am a victim of suffering, a prey to suffering. Surely an
ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known.' When he has
gone forth thus, he acquires gain, honour, and renown. He is pleased
with that gain, honour, and renown, and his intention is fulfilled.
On account of it he lauds himself and disparages others thus: 'I
have gain, honour, and renown, but these other bhikkhus are unknown,
of no account.' So he arouses no desire to act, he makes no effort
for the realisation of those other states that are higher and more
sublime than gain, honour, and renown; he hangs back and slackens.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote352anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote352sym"><SUP>ccclii</SUP></A></SUP>
I say that this person is like the man needing heartwood, who came to
a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, and passing over its
heartwood, its sapwood, its inner bark, and its outer bark, cut off
its twigs and leaves and took them away thinking they were heartwood;
and so whatever it was he had to make with heartwood, his purpose
will not have been served.</P>

character, but these other bhikkhus are immoral, of evil character.'

<P  >"But
what, brahmin, are the states that are higher and more sublime than
knowledge and vision?</P>
<P  >13.
"Here, brahmin, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded
from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the
first jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought,
with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. This is a state higher
and more sublime than knowledge and vision.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote353anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote353sym"><SUP>cccliii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
"Again, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana, which has
self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained
thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. This too is
a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >15.
"Again, with the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu abides
in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure
with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhana, on
account of which noble ones announce: 'He has a pleasant abiding
who has equanimity and is mindful.' This too [204] is a state
higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >16.
"Again, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana, which has neither-pain-norpleasure and
purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. This too is a state higher
and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >17.
"Again, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with
the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is
infinite', a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite
space. This too is a state higher and more sublime than knowledge and
vision.</P>
<P  >18.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware
that 'consciousness is infinite,' a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the base of infinite consciousness. This too is a state
higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >19.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing,' a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the base of nothingness. This too is a state
higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >20.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of
neitherperception-nor-non-perception. This too is a state higher and
more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >21.
"Again, by completely surmounting the base of
neitherperception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the cessation of perception and feeling. And his taints are
destroyed by seeing with wisdom. This too is a state higher and more
sublime than knowledge and vision. These are the states that are
higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</P>
<P  >22.
"1 say that this person, brahmin, is like a man needing heartwood,
seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, who came to a
great tree standing possessed of heartwood, and cutting off its
heartwood, took it away knowing it was heartwood; and so whatever it
was he had to make with heartwood, his purpose will have been served.</P>
<P  >23.
"So this holy life, brahmin, does not have gain, honour, and renown
for its benefit, or the attainment of virtue for its benefit, or the
attainment of concentration for its benefit, or knowledge and vision
for its benefit. But it is [205] this unshakeable deliverance of mind
that is the goal of this holy life, its heartwood, and its end."</P>
<P  >24.
When this was said, the brahmin Pingalakoccha said to the Blessed
One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama!
Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he
were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was
hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in
the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama
for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. From
today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to
him for refuge for life."</P>
