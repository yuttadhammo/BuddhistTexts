115. Bahudhatuka Sutta - The Many Kinds of Elements</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapindika’s Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” - “Venerable sir,”
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
“Bhikkhus, whatever fears arise, all arise because of the fool, not
because of the wise man; whatever troubles arise, all arise because
of the fool, not because of the wise man; whatever calamities arise,
all arise because of the fool, not because of the wise man. Just as a
fire that starts in a shed made of rushes or grass burns down even a
house with a peaked roof, with walls plastered inside and outside,
shut off, secured by bars, with shuttered windows; so too, bhikkhus,
whatever fears arise … all arise because of the fool, not because
of the wise man. Thus the fool brings fear, the wise man brings no
fear; the fool brings trouble, the wise man brings no trouble; the
fool brings calamity, the wise man brings no calamity. No fear comes
from the wise man, no trouble comes from the wise man, no calamity
comes from the wise man. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train thus:
‘We shall be wise men, we shall be inquirers.’“[62]</P>
<P  >3.
When this was said, the venerable Ananda asked the Blessed One: “In
what way, venerable sir, can a bhikkhu be called a wise man and an
inquirer?”</P>
<P  >“When,
Ananda, a bhikkhu is skilled in the elements, skilled in the bases,
skilled in dependent origination, skilled in what is possible and
what is impossible, in that way he can be called a wise man and an
inquirer.”</P>
<H3 >(THE ELEMENTS)</H3>
<P  >4.
“But, venerable sir, in what way can a bhikkhu be called skilled in
the elements?”</P>
<P  >“There
are, Ananda, these eighteen elements: the eye element, the form.
element, the eye-consciousness element; the ear element, the sound
element, the ear-consciousness element; the nose element, the odour
element, the nose-consciousness element; the tongue element, the
flavour element, the tongueconsciousness element; the body element,
the tangible element, the body-consciousness element; the mind
element, the mindobject element, the mind-consciousness element. When
he knows and sees these eighteen elements, a bhikkhu can be called
skilled in the elements.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1077anc" HREF="#sdendnote1077sym"><SUP>mlxxvii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >5.
“But, venerable sir, might there be another way in which a bhikkhu
can be called skilled in the elements?”</P>
<P  >“There
might be, Ananda. There are, Ananda, these six elements: the earth
element, the water element, the fire element, the air element, the
space element, and the consciousness element. When he knows and sees
these six elements, a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elements.”</P>
<P  >6.
“But, venerable sir, might there be another way in which a bhikkhu
can be called skilled in the elements?”</P>
<P  >“There
might be, Ananda. There are, Ananda, these six elements: the pleasure
element, the pain element, the joy element, the grief element, the
equanimity element, and the ignorance element. When he knows and sees
these six elements, a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the
elements.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1078anc" HREF="#sdendnote1078sym"><SUP>mlxxviii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >7.
“But, venerable sir, might there be another way in which a bhikkhu
can be called skilled in the elements?”</P>
<P  >“There
might be, Ananda. There are, Ananda, these six elements: the sensual
desire element, the renunciation element, the ill will element, the
non-ill will element, [63] the cruelty element, and the non-cruelty
element. When he knows and sees these six elements, a bhikkhu can be
called skilled in the elements.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1079anc" HREF="#sdendnote1079sym"><SUP>mlxxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >8.
“But, venerable sir, might there be another way in which a bhikkhu
can be called skilled in the elements?”</P>
<P  >“There
might be, Ananda. There are, Ananda, these three elements: the
sense-sphere element, the fine-material element, and</P>
<P  >the
immaterial element. When he knows and sees these three elements, a
bhikkhu can be called skilled in the elements.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1080anc" HREF="#sdendnote1080sym"><SUP>mlxxx</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >9.
“But, venerable sir, might there be another way in which a bhikkhu
can be called skilled in the elements?”</P>
<P  >“There
might be, Ananda. There are, Ananda, these two elements: the
conditioned element and the unconditioned element. When he knows and
sees these two elements, a bhikkhu can be called skilled in the
elements.”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1081anc" HREF="#sdendnote1081sym"><SUP>mlxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 >(THE BASES)</H3>
<P  >10.
“But, venerable sir, in what way can a bhikkhu be called skilled in
the bases?”</P>
<P  >“There
are, Ananda, these six internal and external bases: the eye and
forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odours, the tongue and
flavours, the body and tangibles, the mind and mind-objects.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1082anc" HREF="#sdendnote1082sym"><SUP>mlxxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
When he knows and sees these six internal and external bases, a
bhikkhu can be called skilled in the bases.”</P>
<H3 >(DEPENDENT ORIGINATION)</H3>
<P  >11.
“But, venerable sir, in what way can a bhikkhu be called skilled in
dependent origination?”<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1083anc" HREF="#sdendnote1083sym"><SUP>mlxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >“Here,
Ananda, a bhikkhu knows thus: ‘When this exists, that comes to be;
with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that
does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases. That
is, with ignorance as condition, formations [come to be]; with
formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as
condition, mentality-materiality; with mentalitymateriality as
condition, the sixfold base; with the sixfold base as condition,
contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as
condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with
clinging as condition, [64] being; with being as condition, birth;
with birth as condition, ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass
of suffering.</P>
<P  >“‘But
with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes
cessation of formations; with the cessation of formations, cessation
of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation of
mentality-materiality; with the cessation of mentality-materiality,
cessation of the sixfold base; with the cessation of the sixfold
base, cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation
of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with
the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation
of clinging, cessation of being; with the cessation of being,
cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, ageing and death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease. Such is the
cessation of this whole mass of suffering.’ In this way, Ananda, a
bhikkhu can be called skilled in dependent origination.”</P>
<H3 >(THE POSSIBLE AND THE IMPOSSIBLE)</H3>
<P  >12.
“But, venerable sir, in what way can a bhikkhu be called skilled in
what is possible and what is impossible?”</P>
<P  >“Here,
Ananda, a bhikkhu understands: ‘It is impossible, it cannot happen
that a person possessing right view could treat any formation as

When this was said, the venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: “It
is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! What is the name of
this discourse on the Dhamma?”</P>
<P  >“You
may remember this discourse on the Dhamma, Ananda, as ‘The Many
Kinds of Elements’ and as ‘The Four Cycles’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1092anc" HREF="#sdendnote1092sym"><SUP>mxcii</SUP></A></SUP>
and as ‘The Mirror of the Dhamma’ and as ‘The Drum of the
Deathless’ and as ‘The Supreme Victory in Battle.’“</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ananda was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
