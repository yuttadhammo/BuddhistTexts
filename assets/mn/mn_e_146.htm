146. Nandakovada Sutta - Advice from Nandaka</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was liv</P>
<P  >ing
at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then Mahapajapati Gotam% together with five hundred bhikkhunis went
to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One, she stood
at one side and said to him: "Venerable sir, let the Blessed One
advise the bhikkhunis, let the Blessed One instruct the bhikkhunis,
let the Blessed One give the bhikkhunis a talk on the Dhamma."</P>
<P  >3.
Now on that occasion the elder bhikkhus were taking turns in advising
the bhikkhunis, but the venerable Nandaka did not want to advise them
when his turn came.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1318anc" HREF="#sdendnote1318sym"><SUP>mcccxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ananda: "Ananda, whose
turn is it today to advise the bhikkhunis?"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, it is the venerable Nandaka's turn to advise the bhikkhunis,
but he does not want to advise them even though it is his turn."</P>
<P  >4.
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Nandaka: "Advise the
bhikkhunis, Nandaka. Instruct the bhikkhunis, Nandaka. Give the
bhikkhunis a talk on the Dhamma, brahmin."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," [271] the venerable Nandaka replied. Then, in the
morning, the venerable Nandaka dressed, and taking his bowl and outer
robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When he had wandered for alms in
Savatthi and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went
with a companion to the Rajaka Park. The bhikkhunis saw the venerable
Nandaka coming in the distance and prepared a seat and set out water
for the feet. The venerable Nandaka sat down on the seat made ready
and washed his feet. The bhikkhunis paid homage to him and sat down
at one side. When they were seated, the venerable Nandaka told the
bhikkhunis:</P>
<P  >5.
"Sisters, this talk will be in the form of questions. When you
understand you should say: 'We understand'; when you do not
understand you should say: 'We do not understand'; when you are
doubtful or perplexed you should ask me: 'How is this, venerable
sir? What is the meaning of this?'"</P>
<P  >"Venerable
sir, we are satisfied and pleased with the master Nandaka for
inviting us in this way."</P>
<P  >6.
"Sisters, what do you think? Is the eye permanent or impermanent?"
- "Impermanent, venerable sir." - "Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable sir." - "Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?" -
"No, venerable sir."</P>
<P  >"Sisters,
what do you think? Is the ear … the nose … the tongue … the
body … the mind permanent or impermanent?" - "Impermanent,
venerable sir." - "Is what is impermanent suffering or
happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable sir." - "Is what is
impermanent, suffering, [272] and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?" -
"No, venerable sir. Why is that? Because, venerable sir, we have
already seen this well as it actually is with proper wisdom thus:
'These six internal bases are impermanent.'"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1319anc" HREF="#sdendnote1319sym"><SUP>mcccxix</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"Good,
good, sisters! So it is with a noble disciple who sees this as it
actually is with proper wisdom.</P>
<P  >7.
"Sisters, what do you think? Are forms … sounds … odours …
flavours … tangibles … mind-objects permanent or impermanent?"
- "Impermanent, venerable sir." - "Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable sir." - "Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?" -
"No, venerable sir. Why is that? Because, venerable sir, we have
already seen this well as it actually is with proper wisdom thus:
'These six external bases are impermanent.'"</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, sisters! So it is with a noble disciple who sees this as it
actually is with proper wisdom.</P>
<P  >8.
"Sisters, what do you think? Is eye-consciousness … [273] …
earconsciousness … nose-consciousness … tongue-consciousness …
body-consciousness … mind-consciousness permanent or impermanent?"
- "Impermanent, venerable sir." - "Is what is impermanent
suffering or happiness?" - "Suffering, venerable sir." - "Is
what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be
regarded thus: 'This is mine, this I am, this is my self'?" -
"No, venerable sir. Why is that? Because, venerable sir, we have
already seen this well as it actually is with proper wisdom thus:
'These six classes of consciousness are impermanent.'"</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, sisters! So it is with a noble disciple who sees this as it
actually is with proper wisdom.</P>
<P  >9.
"Sisters, suppose an oil-lamp is burning: its oil is impermanent
and subject to change, its wick is impermanent and subject to change,
its flame is impermanent and subject to change, and its radiance is
impermanent and subject to change. Now would anyone be speaking
rightly who spoke thus: 'While this oil-lamp is burning, its oil,
wick, and flame are impermanent and subject to change, but its
radiance is permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change'?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because, venerable sir, while that
oil-lamp is burning, its oil, wick, and flame are impermanent and
subject to change, so its radiance must be impermanent and subject to
change."</P>
<P  >"So
too, sisters, would anyone be speaking rightly who spoke thus: 'These
six internal bases are impermanent and subject to change, but the
pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling that one
experiences in dependence upon the six internal bases is permanent,
everlasting, eternal, not subject to change'?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because each feeling arises in dependence
upon its corresponding condition,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1320anc" HREF="#sdendnote1320sym"><SUP>mcccxx</SUP></A></SUP>
[274] and with the cessation of its corresponding condition, the
feeling ceases."</P>
<P  >"Good,
good, sisters! So it is with a noble disciple who sees this as it
actually is with proper wisdom.</P>
<P  >10.
"Sisters, suppose a great tree is standing possessed of heartwood:
its root is impermanent and subject to change, its trunk is
impermanent and subject to change, its branches and foliage are
impermanent and subject to change, and its shadow is impermanent and
subject to change. Now would anyone be speaking rightly who spoke
thus: 'The root, trunk, branches, and foliage of this great tree
standing possessed of heartwood are impermanent and subject to
change, but its shadow is permanent, everlasting, eternal, not
subject to change'?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because, venerable sir, the root, trunk,
branches, and foliage of this great tree standing possessed of
heartwood are impermanent and subject to change, so its shadow must
be impermanent and subject to change."</P>
<P  >"So
too, sisters, would anyone be speaking rightly who spoke thus: 'These
six external bases are impermanent and subject to change, but the
pleasant, painful, or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling that one
experiences in dependence upon the six external bases is permanent,
everlasting, eternal, not subject to change'?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because each feeling arises in dependence
upon its corresponding condition, and with the cessation of its
corresponding condition, the feeling ceases."</P>

<P  >11.
"Sisters, suppose a skilled butcher or his apprentice were to kill
a cow and carve it up with a sharp butcher's knife. Without
damaging the inner mass of flesh and without damaging the outer hide,
he would cut, sever, and carve away the inner tendons, sinews, and
ligaments with the sharp butcher's knife. [275] Then having cut,
severed, and carved all this away, he would remove the outer hide and
cover the cow again with that same hide. Would he be speaking rightly
if he were to say: 'This cow is joined to this hide just as it was
before'?"</P>
<P  >"No,
venerable sir. Why is that? Because if that skilled butcher or his
apprentice were to kill a cow … and cut, sever, and carve all that
away, even though he covers the cow again with that same hide and
says: 'This cow is joined to this hide just as it was before,'
that cow would still be disjoined from that hide."</P>
<P  >12.
"Sisters, I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning.
This is the meaning: 'The inner mass of flesh' is a term for the
six internal bases. 'The outer hide' is a term for the six
external bases. 'The inner tendons, sinews, and ligaments' is a
term for delight and lust. 'The sharp butcher's knife' is a
term for noble wisdom - the noble wisdom that cuts, severs, and
carves away the inner defilements, fetters, and bonds.</P>
<P  >13.
"Sisters, there are these seven enlightenment factors<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1321anc" HREF="#sdendnote1321sym"><SUP>mcccxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
through the development and cultivation of which a bhikkhu, by
realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now enters upon
and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that
are taintless with the destruction of the taints. What are the seven?
Here, sisters, a bhikkhu develops the mindfulness enlightenment
factor, which is supported by seclusion, dispassion, and cessation,
and ripens in relinquishment. He develops the investigation-of-states
enlightenment factor. . .the energy enlightenment factor … the
rapture enlightenment factor … the tranquillity enlightenment
factor … the concentration enlightenment factor … the equanimity
enlightenment factor, which is supported by seclusion, dispassion,
and cessation, and ripens in relinquishment. These are the seven
enlightenment factors through the development and cultivation of
which a bhikkhu, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, here
and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and
deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the
taints." [276]</P>
<P  >14.
When the venerable Nandaka had advised the bhikkhunis thus, he
dismissed them, saying: "Go, sisters, it is time." Then the
bhikkhunis, having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Nandaka's
words, rose from their seats, and after paying homage to the
venerable Nandaka, departed keeping him on their right. They went to
the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, stood at one side.
The Blessed One told them: "Go, sisters, it is time." Then the
bhikkhunis paid homage to the Blessed One and departed keeping him on
their right.</P>
<P  >15.
Soon after they had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:
"Bhikkhus, just as on the Uposatha day of the fourteenth people are
not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is incomplete or
full, since then the moon is clearly incomplete, so too, those
bhikkhunis are satisfied with Nandaka's teaching of the Dhamma, but
their intention has not yet been fulfilled."</P>
<P  >16-26.
Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Nandaka: "Well then,
Nandaka, tomorrow too you should advise those bhikkhunis in exactly
the same way."</P>
<P  >"Yes,
venerable sir," the venerable Nandaka replied. Then, the next
morning, the venerable Nandaka dressed … (repeat verbatim §§4-14
above, as far as) [277] … Then the bhikkhunis paid homage to the
Blessed One and departed keeping him on their right.</P>
<P  >27.
Soon after they had left, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:
"Bhikkhus, just as on the Uposatha day of the fifteenth people are
not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is incomplete or
full, since then the moon is clearly full, so too, those bhikkhunis
are satisfied with Nandaka's teaching of the Dhamma and their
intention has been fulfilled. Bhikkhus, even the least advanced of
those five hundred bhikkhunis is a stream-enterer, no longer subject
to perdition, bound [for deliverance], headed for enlightenment."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1322anc" HREF="#sdendnote1322sym"><SUP>mcccxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
