45. Culadhammasamadana Sutta - The Shorter Discourse on Ways of
Undertaking Things</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthl in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:</P>
<P  >2.
"Bhikkhus, there are four ways of undertaking things. What are the
four? There is a way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and
ripens in the future as pain. There is a way of undertaking things
that is painful now and ripens in the future as pain. There is a way
of undertaking things that is painful now and ripens in the future as
pleasure. There is a way of undertaking things that is pleasant now
and ripens in the future as pleasure.</P>
<P  >3.
"What, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is pleasant
now and ripens in the future as pain? Bhikkhus, there are certain
recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: 'There is no
harm in sensual pleasures.' They take to gulping down sensual
pleasures and divert themselves with women wanderers who wear their
hair bound in a topknot. They say thus: 'What future fear do these
good recluses and brahmins see in sensual pleasures when they speak
of abandoning sensual pleasures and describe the full understanding
of sensual pleasures? Pleasant is the touch of this woman wanderer's
tender soft downy arm!' Thus they take to gulping down sensual
pleasures, and having done so, on the dissolution of the body, after
death, they reappear in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy
destination, in perdition, even in hell. There they feel painful,
racking, piercing feelings. They say thus: 'This is the future fear
those good recluses and brahmins saw in sensual pleasures when they
spoke of abandoning sensual pleasures and described the full
understanding of sensual pleasures. For it is by reason of sensual
pleasures, [306] owing to sensual pleasures, that we are now feeling
painful, racking, piercing feelings.'</P>
<P  >4.
"Bhikkhus, suppose that in the last month of the hot season a
maluva-creeper pod burst open and a maluva-creeper seed fell at the
foot of a sala tree. Then a deity living in that tree became fearful,
perturbed, and frightened; but the deity's friends and companions,
kinsmen and relatives - garden deities, park deities, tree deities,
and deities inhabiting medicinal herbs, grass, and forest-monarch
trees - gathered together and reassured that deity thus: 'Have no
fear, sir, have no fear. Perhaps a peacock will swallow the
maluva-creeper seed or a wild animal will eat it or a forest fire
will burn it or woodsmen will carry it off or white ants will devour
it or it may not even be fertile.' But no peacock swallowed that
seed, no wild animal ate it, no forest fire burned it, no woodsmen
carried it off, no white ants devoured it, and it was in fact
fertile. Then, being moistened by rain from a rainbearing cloud, the
seed in due course sprouted and the maluva creeper's tender soft
downy tendril wound itself around that sala tree. Then the deity
living in the sala tree thought: 'What future fear did my friends
and companions, kinsmen and relatives ... see in that maluva-creeper
seed when they gathered together and reassured me as they did?
Pleasant is the touch of this maluva creeper's tender soft downy
tendril!' Then the creeper enfolded the sala tree, made a canopy
over it, draped a curtain all around it, and split the main branches
of the tree. The deity who lived in the tree then realised: 'This
is the future fear they saw in that maluva-creeper seed. [307]
Because of that maluva-creeper seed I am now feeling painful,
racking, piercing feelings.'</P>
<P  >"So
too, bhikkhus, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine
and view is this: 'There is no harm in sensual pleasures.' ...
They say thus: 'This is the future fear those good recluses and
brahmins saw in sensual pleasures ... that we are now feeling
painful, racking, piercing feelings.' This is called the way of
undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens in the future as
pain.</P>
<P  >5.
"And what, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
painful now and ripens in the future as pain? Here, bhikkhus, someone
goes naked, rejecting conventions, licking his hands, not coming when
asked, not stopping when asked ... (as Sutta 12, ยง45) [308] ... He
dwells pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily
including the evening. Thus in such a variety of ways he dwells
pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body. On the
dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.
This is called the way of undertaking things that is painful now and
ripens in the future as pain.</P>
<P  >6.
"And what, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
painful now and ripens in the future as pleasure? Here, bhikkhus,
someone by nature has strong lust, and he constantly experiences pain
and grief born of lust; by nature he has strong hate, and he
constantly experiences pain and grief born of hate; by nature he has
strong delusion, and he constantly experiences pain and grief born of
delusion. Yet in pain and grief, weeping with tearful face, he leads
the perfect and pure holy life. On the dissolution of the body, after
death, he reappears in a happy destination, even in the heavenly
world. This is called the way of undertaking things that is painful
now and ripens in the future as pleasure.</P>
<P  >7.
"And what, bhikkhus, is the way of undertaking things that is
pleasant now and ripens in the future as pleasure? Here, bhikkhus,
someone by nature does not have strong lust, and he does not
constantly experience pain and grief born of lust; by nature he does
not have strong hate, and he does not constantly experience pain and
grief born of hate; by nature he does not have strong delusion, [309]
and he does not constantly experience pain and grief born of
delusion. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the first jhana ...
With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon
and abides in the second jhana ... With the fading away as well of
rapture ... he enters upon and abides in the third jhana ... With the
abandoning of pleasure and pain ... he enters upon and abides in the
fourth jhana ... On the dissolution of the body, after death, he
reappears in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world. This is
called the way of undertaking things that is pleasant now and ripens
in the future as pleasure. These, bhikkhus, are the four ways of
undertaking things."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
