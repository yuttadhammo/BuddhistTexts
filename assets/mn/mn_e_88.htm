88. Bahitika Sutta - The Cloak</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the venerable Ananda dressed, and taking
his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Savatthi and had returned from his almsround,
after his meal he went to the Eastern Park, to the Palace of Migara's
Mother, for the day's abiding.</P>
<P  >3.
Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had mounted the elephant
Ekapundarika and was riding out from Savatthi at midday. He saw the
venerable Ananda coming in the distance and asked the minister
Sirivaddha: "That is the venerable Ananda, is it not?" - "Yes,
sire, that is the venerable Ananda."</P>
<P  >4.
Then King Pasenadi of Kosala told a man: "Come, good man, go to the
venerable Ananda and pay homage in my name with your head at his
feet, saying: 'Venerable sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage
with his head at the venerable Ananda's feet.' Then say this:
'Venerable sir, if the venerable Ananda has no urgent business,
perhaps the venerable Ananda would wait [113] a moment, out of
compassion.'"</P>
<P  >5.
"Yes, sire," the man replied, and he went to the venerable
Ananda, and after paying homage to him, he stood at one side and said
to the venerable Ananda: "Venerable sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala
pays homage with his head at the venerable Ananda's feet and he
says this: 'Venerable sir, if the venerable Ananda has no urgent
business, perhaps the venerable Ananda would wait a moment, out of
compassion.'"</P>
<P  >6.
The venerable Ananda consented in silence. Then King Pasenadi went by
elephant as far as the elephant could go, and then he dismounted and
went to the venerable Ananda on foot. After paying homage to him, he
stood at one side and said to the venerable Ananda: "If, venerable
sir, the venerable Ananda has no urgent business, it would be good if
he would go to the bank of the river Aciravati, out of compassion."</P>
<P  >7.
The venerable Ananda consented in silence. He went to the bank of the
river Aciravati and sat down at the root of a tree on a seat made
ready. Then King Pasenadi went by elephant as far as the elephant
could go, and then he dismounted and went to the venerable Ananda on
foot. After paying homage to him, he stood at one side and said to
the venerable Ananda: "Here, venerable sir, is an elephant rug. Let
the venerable Ananda be seated on it."</P>
<P  >"There
is no need, great king. Sit down. I am sitting on my own mat."</P>
<P  >8.
King Pasenadi of Kosala sat down on a seat made ready and said:
"Venerable Ananda, would the Blessed One behave with the body in
such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahmins?"<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote831anc" HREF="#sdendnote831sym"><SUP>dcccxxxi</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >"No,
great king, the Blessed One would not behave with the body in such a
way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahmins." [114]</P>
<P  >"Would
the Blessed One, venerable Ananda, behave with speech … behave with
the mind in such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and
brahmins?"</P>
<P  >"No,
great king, the Blessed One would not behave with speech … behave
with the mind in such a way that he could be censured by wise
recluses and brahmins."</P>
<P  >9.
"It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! For what we were
unable to accomplish with a question has been accomplished by the
venerable Ananda with the answer to the question. We do not recognise
anything of value in the praise and blame of others spoken by foolish
ignorant persons, who speak without having investigated and
evaluated; but we recognise as valuable the praise and blame of
others spoken by wise, intelligent, and sagacious persons who speak
after having investigated and evaluated.</P>
<P  >10.
"Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is censured
by wise recluses and brahmins?"</P>
<P  >"Any
bodily behaviour that is unwholesome, great king."</P>
<P  >"Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is unwholesome?"</P>
<P  >"Any
bodily behaviour that is blameworthy, great king."</P>
<P  >"Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is blameworthy?"</P>
<P  >"Any
bodily behaviour that brings affliction, great king." "Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour brings affliction?"</P>
<P  >"Any
bodily behaviour that has painful results, great king." "Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour has painful results?"</P>
<P  >"Any
bodily behaviour, great king, that leads to one's own affliction,
or to the affliction of others, or to the affliction of both, and on
account of which unwholesome states increase and wholesome states
diminish. Such bodily behaviour is censured by wise recluses and
brahmins, great king."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote832anc" HREF="#sdendnote832sym"><SUP>dcccxxxii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >11.
"Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of verbal behaviour is censured
by wise recluses and brahmins?"</P>
<P  >"Any
verbal behaviour that is unwholesome … (complete as in §10,
substituting "verbal behaviour" for "bodily behaviour") … "
12. "Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of mental behaviour is
censured by wise recluses and brahmins?"</P>
<P  >"Any
mental behaviour that is unwholesome … (complete as in §10,
substituting "mental behaviour" for "bodily behaviour") [115]
… "</P>
<P  >13.
"Now, venerable Ananda, does the Blessed One praise only the
abandoning of all unwholesome states?" "The Tathagata, great
king, has abandoned all unwholesome states and he possesses wholesome
states."<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote833anc" HREF="#sdendnote833sym"><SUP>dcccxxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
"Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is uncensured
by wise recluses and brahmins?"</P>
<P  >"Any
bodily behaviour that is wholesome, great king."</P>
<P  >"Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is wholesome?"</P>
<P  >"Any
bodily behaviour that is blameless, great king."</P>
<P  >"Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour is blameless?"</P>
<P  >"Any
bodily behaviour that does not bring affliction, great king." "Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour does not bring
affliction?"</P>
<P  >"Any
bodily behaviour that has pleasant results, great king." "Now,
venerable Ananda, what kind of bodily behaviour has pleasant
results?"</P>
<P  >"Any
bodily behaviour, great king, that does not lead to one's own
affliction, or to the affliction of others, or to the affliction of
both, and on account of which unwholesome states diminish and
wholesome states increase. Such bodily behaviour, great king, is
uncensured by wise recluses and brahmins."</P>
<P  >15.
"Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of verbal behaviour is uncensured
by wise recluses and brahmins?"</P>
<P  >"Any
verbal behaviour that is wholesome … (complete as in §14,
substituting "verbal behaviour" for "bodily behaviour") … "</P>
<P  >16.
"Now, venerable Ananda, what kind of mental behaviour is uncensured
by wise recluses and brahmins?"</P>
<P  >"Any
mental behaviour that is wholesome … (complete as in §14,
substituting "mental behaviour" for "bodily behaviour") [116]
… "</P>
<P  >17.
"Now, venerable Ananda, does the Blessed One praise only the
undertaking of all wholesome states?"</P>
<P  >"The
Tathagata, great king, has abandoned all unwholesome states and
possesses wholesome states."</P>
<P  >18.
"It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous how well that has
been expressed by the venerable Ananda! And we are satisfied and
pleased by what has been so well expressed by him. Venerable sir, we
are so satisfied and pleased with what has been so well expressed by
the venerable Ananda that if the elephant-treasure were allowed to
him, we would give it to him; if the horse-treasure were allowed to
him, we would give it to him; if the boon of a village were allowed
to him, we would give it to him. But we know, venerable sir, that
these are not allowable for the venerable Ananda. But there is this
cloak of mine,<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote834anc" HREF="#sdendnote834sym"><SUP>dcccxxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
venerable sir, which was sent to me packed in a royal umbrella case
by King Ajatasattu of Magadha, sixteen hands long and eight hands
wide. Let the venerable Ananda accept it out of compassion."</P>
<P  >"It
is not necessary, great king. My triple robe is complete." [117]</P>
<P  >19.
"Venerable sir, this river Aciravati has been seen both by the
venerable Ananda and by ourselves when a great cloud has rained
heavily on the mountains; then this river Aciravati overflows both
its banks. So too, venerable sir, the venerable Ananda can make a
triple robe for himself out of this cloak, and he can share out his
old triple robe among his companions in the holy life. In this way,
our offering will overflow. Venerable sir, let the venerable Ananda
accept the cloak."</P>
<P  >20.
The venerable Ananda accepted the cloak. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala
said: "And now, venerable sir, we depart. We are busy and have much
to do."</P>
<P  >"Now
is the time, great king, to do as you think fit."</P>
<P  >Then
King Pasenadi of Kosala, having delighted and rejoiced in the
venerable Ananda's words, rose from his seat, and after paying
homage to the venerable Ananda, keeping him on his right, he
departed.</P>
<P  >21.
Then soon after he had left, the venerable Ananda went to the Blessed
One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side, related
to him his entire conversation with King Pasenadi of Kosala, and
presented the cloak to the Blessed One.</P>
<P  >22.
Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "It is a gain,
bhikkhus, for King Pasenadi of Kosala, it is a great gain for King
Pasenadi of Kosala that he has had the opportunity of seeing and
paying respect to Ananda."</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
