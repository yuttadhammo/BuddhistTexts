110. Culapunnama Sutta - The Shorter Discourse on the Full-moon Night</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at
Savatthi in the Eastern Park, in the Palace of Migara's Mother.</P>
<P  >2.
On that occasion - the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, on the
full-moon night - [21] the Blessed One was seated in the open
surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. Then, surveying the silent
Sangha of bhikkhus, he addressed them thus:</P>
<P  >3.
"Bhikkhus, would an untrue man<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote1045anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdendnote1045sym"><SUP>mxlv</SUP></A></SUP>
know of an untrue man: 'This person is an untrue man'?'' -
"No, venerable sir." - "Good, bhikkhus. It is impossible, it
cannot be, that an untrue man should know of an untrue man: 'This
person is an untrue man.' But would an untrue man know of a true
man: 'This person is a true man'?" - "No, venerable sir." -
"Good, bhikkhus. It is impossible, it cannot be, that an untrue man
should know of a true man: 'This person is a true man.'</P>
<P  >4.
"Bhikkhus, an untrue man is possessed of bad qualities; he
associates as an untrue man, he wills as an untrue man, he counsels
as an untrue man, he speaks as an untrue man, he acts as an untrue
man, he holds views as an untrue man, and he gives gifts as an untrue
man.</P>
<P  >5.
"And how is an untrue man possessed of bad qualities? Here an
untrue man has no faith, no shame, no fear of wrongdoing; he is
unlearned, lazy, forgetful, and unwise. That is how an untrue man is
possessed of bad qualities.</P>
<P  >6.
"And how does an untrue man associate as an untrue man? Here an
untrue man has for friends and companions those recluses and brahmins
who have no faith, no shame, no fear of wrongdoing; who are
unlearned, lazy, forgetful, and unwise. That is how an untrue man
associates as an untrue man.</P>
<P  >7.
"And how does an untrue man will as an untrue man? Here an untrue
man wills for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and
for the affliction of both. That is how an untrue man wills as an
untrue man.</P>
<P  >8.
"And how does an untrue man counsel as an untrue man? Here an
untrue man counsels for his own affliction, for the affliction of
others, and for the affliction of both. [22] That is how an untrue
man counsels as an untrue man.</P>
<P  >9.
"And how does an untrue man speak as an untrue man? Here an untrue
man speaks false speech, malicious speech, harsh speech, and gossip.
That is how an untrue man speaks as an untrue man.</P>
<P  >10.

man kills living beings, takes what is not given, and misconducts
himself in sensual pleasures. That is how an untrue man acts as an

<P  >11.
"And how does an untrue man hold views as an untrue man? Here an
untrue man holds such a view as this: 'There is nothing given,
nothing offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and
bad actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no
beings who are reborn spontaneously; no good and virtuous recluses
and brahmins in the world who have realised for themselves by direct
knowledge and declare this world and the other world.' That is how
an untrue man holds views as an untrue man.</P>
<P  >12.
"And how does an untrue man give gifts as an untrue man? Here an
untrue man gives a gift carelessly, gives it not with his own hand,
gives it without showing respect, gives what is to be discarded,
gives it with the view that nothing will come of it. That is how an
untrue man gives gifts as an untrue man.</P>
<P  >13.
"That untrue man - thus possessed of bad qualities, who thus
associates as an untrue man, wills as an untrue man, counsels as an
untrue man, speaks as an untrue man, acts as an untrue man, holds
views as an untrue man, and gives gifts as an untrue man - on the
dissolution of the body, after death, reappears in the destination of
untrue men. And what is the destination of untrue men? It is hell or
the animal world.</P>
<P  >14.
"Bhikkhus, would a true man know of a true man: 'This person is a
true man'?" [23] - "Yes, venerable sir." - "Good, bhikkhus.
It is possible that a true man would know of a true man: 'This
person is a true man.' But would a true man know of an untrue man:
'This person is an untrue man'T' - "Yes, venerable sir." -
"Good, bhikkhus. It is possible that a true man would know of an
untrue man: 'This person is an untrue man.'</P>
<P  >15.

as a true man, he wills as a true man, he counsels as a true man, he

man, and he gives gifts as a true man.</P>
<P  >16.
"And how is a true man possessed of good qualities? Here a true man

qualities.</P>
<P  >17.

<P  >22.
"And how does a true man hold views as a true man? Here a true man
holds such a view as this: 'There is what is given and what is
offered and what is sacrificed; there is fruit and result of good and
bad actions; there is this world and the other world; there is mother
and father; there are beings who are reborn spontaneously; there are
good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have
realised for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world
and the other world.' That is how a true man holds views as a true
man.</P>
<P  >23.
"And how does a true man give gifts as a true man? Here a true man
gives a gift carefully, gives it with his own hand, gives it showing
respect, gives a valuable gift, gives it with the view that something
will come of it. That is how a true man gives gifts as a true man.</P>
<P  >24.
"That true man - thus possessed of good qualities, who thus
associates as a true man, wills as a true man, counsels as a true
man, speaks as a true man, acts as a true man, holds views as a true
man, and gives gifts as a true man - on the dissolution of the body,
after death, reappears in the destination of true men. And what is
the destination of true men? It is greatness among the gods or
greatness among human beings."</P>
<P  >That

delighted in the Blessed One's words.</P>
