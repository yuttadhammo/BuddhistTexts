66. Latukikopama Sutta - The Simile of the Quail</H2>
<P  >1.
THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the
country of the Anguttarapans at a town of theirs named Apana.</P>
<P  >2.
Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, went into Apana for alms. When he had wandered
for alms in Apana and had returned from his almsround, after his meal
he went to a certain grove for the day’s abiding. Having entered
the grove, he sat down at the root of a tree for the day’s abiding.</P>
<P  >3.
When it was morning, the venerable Udayin dressed, and taking his
bowl and outer robe, he too went into Apana for alms. When he had
wandered for alms in Apana and had returned from his almsround, after
his meal he went to that same grove for the day’s abiding. Having
entered the grove, he sat down at the root of a tree for the day’s
abiding.</P>
<P  >4.
Then, while the venerable Udayin was alone in meditation, the
following thought arose in his mind: “How many painful states has
the Blessed One rid us of! How many pleasant states has the Blessed
One brought us! How many unwholesome states has the Blessed One rid
us of! How many wholesome states has the Blessed One brought us!”</P>
<P  >5.
Then, when it was evening, the venerable Udayin rose from meditation,
went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down
at one side [448] and told him:</P>
<P  >6.
“Here, venerable sir, while I was alone in meditation, the
following thought arose in my mind: ‘How many painful states has
the Blessed One rid us of! … How many wholesome states has the
Blessed One brought us!’ Venerable sir, formerly we used to eat in
the evening, in the morning, and during the day outside the proper
time. Then there was an occasion when the</P>
<P  >Blessed
One addressed the bhikkhus thus: ‘Bhikkhus, please abandon that
daytime meal outside the proper time.’<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote671anc" HREF="#sdendnote671sym"><SUP>dclxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
Venerable sir, I was upset and sad, thinking: ‘Faithful
householders give us good food of various kinds during the day
outside the proper time, yet the Blessed One tells us to abandon it,
the Sublime One tells us to relinquish it.’ Out of our love and
respect for the Blessed One, and out of shame and fear of wrongdoing,
we abandoned that daytime meal outside the proper time.</P>
<P  >“Then
we ate only in the evening and in the morning. Then there was an
occasion when the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: ‘Bhikkhus,
please abandon that night meal, which is outside the proper time.’
Venerable sir, I was upset and sad, thinking: ‘The Blessed One
tells us to abandon the more sumptuous of our two meals, the Sublime
One tells us to relinquish it.’ Once, venerable sir, a certain man
had obtained some soup during the day and he said: ‘Put that aside
and we will all eat it together in the evening.’ [Nearly] all
cooking is done at night, little by day. Out of our love and respect
for the Blessed One, and out of shame and fear of wrongdoing, we
abandoned that night meal, which was outside the proper time.</P>
<P  >“It
has happened, venerable sir, that bhikkhus wandering for alms in the
thick darkness of the night have walked into a cesspit, fallen into a
sewer, walked into a thornbush, and fallen over a sleeping cow; they
have met hoodlums who had already committed a crime and those
planning one, and they have been sexually enticed by women. Once,
venerable sir, I went wandering for alms in the thick darkness of the
night. A woman washing a pot saw me by a flash of lightning and
screamed out in terror: ‘Mercy me, a devil has come for me!’ I
told her: ‘Sister, I am no devil, I am a bhikkhu [449] waiting for
alms.’ -’Then it’s a bhikkhu whose ma’s died and whose pa’s
died!<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote672anc" HREF="#sdendnote672sym"><SUP>dclxxii</SUP></A></SUP>
Better, bhikkhu, that you get your belly cut open with a sharp
butcher’s knife than this prowling for alms for your belly’s sake
in the thick darkness of the night!’ Venerable sir, when I
recollected that I thought: ‘How many painful states has the
Blessed One rid us of! How many pleasant states has the Blessed One
brought us! How many unwholesome states has the Blessed One rid us
of! How many wholesome states has the Blessed One brought us!’“</P>
<P  >7.
“So too, Udayin, there are certain misguided men here who, when
told by me ‘Abandon this,’ say: ‘What, such a mere trifle, such
a little thing as this? ‘This recluse is much too exacting!’ And
they do not abandon that and they show discourtesy towards me as well
as towards those bhikkhus desirous of training. For them that thing
becomes a strong, stout, tough, unrotting tether and a thick yoke.</P>
<P  >8.
“Suppose, Udayin, a quail were tethered by a rotting creeper and
would thereby expect injury, captivity, or death. Now suppose someone
said: ‘The rotting creeper by which that quail is tethered and
thereby expects injury, captivity, or death, is for her a feeble,
weak, rotting, coreless tether.’ Would he be speaking rightly?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. For that quail the rotting creeper by which she is
tethered and thereby expects injury, captivity, or death, is a
strong, stout, tough, unrotting tether and a thick yoke.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, Udayin there are certain misguided men here who, when told by me
‘Abandon this’ … do not abandon that and they show discourtesy
towards me as well as towards those bhikkhus desirous of training.
For them that thing becomes a strong, stout, tough, unrotting tether
and a thick yoke.</P>
<P  >9.
“Udayin, there are certain clansmen here who, [450] when told by me
‘Abandon this,’ say: ‘What, such a mere trifle, such a little
thing to be abandoned as this, the Blessed One tells us to abandon,
the Sublime One tells us to relinquish.’ Yet they abandon that and
do not show discourtesy towards me or towards those bhikkhus desirous
of training. Having abandoned it, they live at ease, unruffled,
subsisting on others’ gifts, with mind [as aloof] as a wild deer’s.
For them that thing becomes a feeble, weak, rotting, coreless tether.</P>
<P  >10.
“Suppose, Udayin, a royal tusker elephant with tusks as long as
chariot-poles, full-grown in stature, high-bred and accustomed to
battle, were tethered by stout leather thongs, but by simply twisting
his body a little he could break and burst the thongs and then go
where he likes. Now suppose someone said: ‘The stout leather thongs
by which this royal tusker elephant is tethered … are for him a
strong, stout, tough, unrotting tether and a thick yoke.’ Would he
be speaking rightly?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. The stout leather thongs by which that royal tusker
elephant is tethered, which by simply twisting his</P>
<P  >body
a little he could break and burst and then go where he likes, are for
him a feeble, weak, rotting, coreless tether.”</P>
<P  >“So
too, Udayin, there are certain clansmen here who, when told by me
‘Abandon this’ … abandon that and do not show discourtesy
towards me or towards those bhikkhus desirous of training. Having
abandoned it, they live at ease, unruffled, subsisting on others’
gifts, with mind [as aloof] as a wild deer’s. For them that thing
becomes a feeble, weak, rotting, coreless tether.</P>
<P  >11.
“Suppose, Udayin, there were a poor, penniless, destitute man, and
he had one dilapidated hovel open to the crows, not the best kind,
and one dilapidated wicker bedstead, not the best kind, [451] and
some grain and pumpkin seeds in a pot, not the best kind, and one hag
of a wife, not the best kind. He might see a bhikkhu in a monastery
park sitting in the shade of a tree, his hands and feet well washed
after he had eaten a delicious meal, devoting himself to the higher
mind. He might think: ‘How pleasant the recluse’s state is! How
healthy the recluse’s state is! If only I could shave off my hair
and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life
into homelessness!’ But being unable to abandon his one dilapidated
hovel open to the crows, not the best kind, and his one dilapidated
wicker bedstead, not the best kind, and his grain and pumpkin seeds
in a pot, not the best kind, and his hag of a wife, not the best
kind, he is unable to shave off his hair and beard, put on the yellow
robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness. Now suppose
someone said: ‘The tethers by which that man is tethered so that he
cannot abandon his one dilapidated hovel … and his hag of a wife,
not the best kind, and shave off his hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness - for
him those are a feeble, weak, rotting, coreless tether.’ Would he
be speaking rightly?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. The tethers by which that man is tethered so that he
cannot abandon his one dilapidated hovel … and his hag of a wife,
not the best kind, and shave off his hair and beard, put on the
yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness - for
him those are a strong, stout, tough, unrotting tether and a thick
yoke.”</P>
<P  >“So

me ‘Abandon this’ … do not abandon that and they show
discourtesy towards me as well as towards those bhikkhus desirous of

unrotting tether and a thick yoke.</P>
<P  >12.
“Suppose, Udayin, there were a rich householder or a householder’s
son, [452] with great wealth and property, with a vast number of gold
ingots, a vast number of granaries, a vast number of fields, a vast
amount of land, a vast number of wives, and a vast number of men and
women slaves. He might see a bhikkhu in a monastery park sitting in
the shade of a tree, his hands and feet well washed after he had
eaten a delicious meal, devoting himself to the higher mind. He might
think: ‘How pleasant the recluse’s state is! How healthy the
recluse’s state is! If only I could shave off my hair and beard,
put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into
homelessness!’ And being able to abandon his vast number of gold
ingots, his vast number of granaries, his vast number of fields, his
vast amount of land, his vast number of wives, and his vast number of
men and women slaves, he is able to shave off his hair and beard, put
on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into
homelessness. Now suppose someone said: ‘The tethers by which that
householder or householder’s son is tethered so that he can abandon
his vast number of gold ingots … his vast number of men and women
slaves, and shave off his hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and
go forth from the home life into homelessness - for him those are a
strong, stout, tough, unrotting tether.’ Would he be speaking
rightly?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir. The tethers by which that householder or householder’s
son is tethered so that he can abandon his vast number of gold ingots
… his vast number of men and women slaves, and shave off his hair

into homelessness - for him those are a feeble, weak, rotting,

<P  >“So
too, Udayin, there are certain clansmen here who, when told by me
‘Abandon this’ … abandon that and do not show discourtesy

Having abandoned it, they live at ease, unruf</P>
<P  >fled,
subsisting on others’ gifts, with mind [as aloof] as a wild deer’s.
For them that thing becomes a feeble, weak, rotting, coreless tether.</P>

“Udayin, there are four kinds of persons to be found existing in
the world. What are the four?<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote673anc" HREF="#sdendnote673sym"><SUP>dclxxiii</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P  >14.
“Here, Udayin, some person practises the way to the abandoning of
attachment, to the relinquishing of attachment.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote674anc" HREF="#sdendnote674sym"><SUP>dclxxiv</SUP></A></SUP>
When he is practising the way, memories and intentions associated
with attachment beset him. He tolerates them; he does not abandon
them, remove them, do away with them, and annihilate them. Such a
person I call fettered, not unfettered. Why is that? Because I have
known the particular diversity of faculties in this person.</P>

“Here, Udayin, some person practises the way to the abandoning of
attachment, to the relinquishing of attachment. When he is practising
the way, memories and intentions associated with attachment beset him
now and then through lapses of mindfulness. His mindfulness may be
slow in arising, but he quickly abandons them, removes them, does
away with them, and annihilates them.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote676anc" HREF="#sdendnote676sym"><SUP>dclxxvi</SUP></A></SUP>
Just as if a man were to let two or three drops of water fall onto an
iron plate heated for a whole day, the falling of the water drops
might be slow but they would quickly vaporise and vanish. So too,
here some person practises the way … His mindfulness may be slow in
arising, but he quickly abandons them, removes them, does away with
them, and annihilates them. Such a person too I call fettered, not
unfettered. [454] Why is that? Because I have known the particular
diversity of faculties in this person.</P>
<P  >17.
“Here, Udayin, some person, having understood that attachment is
the root of suffering, divests himself of attachment and is liberated
with the destruction of attachment. Such a person I call unfettered,
not fettered.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote677anc" HREF="#sdendnote677sym"><SUP>dclxxvii</SUP></A></SUP>
Why is that? Because I have known the particular diversity of
faculties in this person.</P>
<P  >18.
“There are, Udayin, five cords of sensual pleasure. What are the
five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear … Odours
cognizable by the nose … Flavours cognizable by the tongue …
Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired,
agreeable, and likeable, connected with sensual desire and
provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure.</P>
<P  >19.
“Now, Udayin, the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these
five cords of sensual pleasure are called sensual pleasure - a filthy
pleasure, a coarse pleasure, an ignoble pleasure. I say of this kind
of pleasure that it should not be pursued, that it should not be
developed, that it should not be cultivated, that it should be
feared.</P>
<P  >20.
“Here, Udayin, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana … With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he
enters upon and abides in the second jhana … With the fading away
as well of rapture … he enters upon and abides in the third jhana …
With the abandoning of pleasure and pain … he enters upon and
abides in the fourth jhana …</P>
<P  >21.
“This is called the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion,
the bliss of peace, the bliss of enlightenment.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote678anc" HREF="#sdendnote678sym"><SUP>dclxxviii</SUP></A></SUP>
I say of this kind of pleasure that it should be pursued, that it
should be developed, that it should be cultivated, that it should not
be feared.</P>
<P  >22.
“Here, Udayin, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana … Now this, I say, belongs to the perturbable.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote679anc" HREF="#sdendnote679sym"><SUP>dclxxix</SUP></A></SUP>
And what therein belongs to the perturbable? The applied thought and
sustained thought that have not ceased therein, that is what belongs
to the perturbable.</P>
<P  >23.
“Here, Udayin, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought,
a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana … Now this, I
say, also belongs to the perturbable. And what therein belongs to the
perturbable? The rapture and pleasure that have not ceased therein,
that is what belongs to the perturbable.</P>
<P  >24.
“Here, Udayin, with the fading away as well of rapture.. .a bhikkhu
enters upon and abides in the third jhana … Now this, I say, also
belongs to the perturbable. And what therein belongs to the
perturbable? The equanimity [455] and pleasure that have not ceased
therein, that is what belongs to the perturbable.</P>
<P  >25.
“Here, Udayin, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain … a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana … Now this, I
say, belongs to the imperturbable.</P>
<P  >26.
“Here, Udayin, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first
jhana … That, I say, is not enough.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote680anc" HREF="#sdendnote680sym"><SUP>dclxxx</SUP></A></SUP>
Abandon it, I say; surmount it, I say. And what surmounts it?</P>
<P  >27.
“Here, Udayin, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought,
a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhana … That
surmounts it. But that too, I say, is not enough. Abandon it, I say;
surmount it, I say. And what surmounts it?</P>
<P  >28.
“Here, Udayin, with the fading away as well of rapture.. .a bhikkhu
enters upon and abides in the third jhana … That surmounts it. But
that too, I say, is not enough. Abandon it, I say; surmount it, I
say. And what surmounts it?</P>
<P  >29.
“Here, Udayin, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain … a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhana … That surmounts
it. But that too, I say, is not enough. Abandon it, I say; surmount
it, I say. And what surmounts it?</P>
<P  >30.
“Here, Udayin, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of
form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with
non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is
infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite
space. That surmounts it. But that too, I say, is not enough. Abandon
it, I say; surmount it, I say. And what surmounts it?</P>
<P  >31.
“Here, Udayin, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters
upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness. That surmounts
it. But that too, I say, is not enough. Abandon it, I say; surmount
it, I say. And what surmounts it?</P>
<P  >32.
“Here, Udayin, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ a bhikkh.u enters
upon and abides in the base of nothingness. That surmounts it. But
that too, I say, is not enough. Abandon it, I say; surmount it, I
say. And what surmounts it?</P>
<P  >33.
“Here, Udayin, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, a
bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. [456] That surmounts it. But
that too, I say, is not enough. Abandon it, I say; surmount it, I
say. And what surmounts it?</P>
<P  >34.
“Here, Udayin, by completely surmounting the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a bhikkhu enters upon and
abides in the cessation of perception and feeling.<SUP><A  NAME="sdendnote681anc" HREF="#sdendnote681sym"><SUP>dclxxxi</SUP></A></SUP>
That surmounts it. Thus I speak of the abandoning even of the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Do you see, Udayin, any
fetter, small or great, of whose abandoning I do not speak?”</P>
<P  >“No,
venerable sir.”</P>
<P  >That
is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Udayin was satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</P>
