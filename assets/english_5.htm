He should next arouse joy<br>of happiness by recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma,<br>and the Sangha; then awe by&nbsp;thinking, “Now,&nbsp;this is the way of renunciation<br>entered upon by&nbsp;all Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas and noble disciples”; and then<br>eagerness by&nbsp;thinking, “In this way I shall surely come to know the taste of the<br>bliss of seclusion.” [125] After that he should open his eyes moderately, apprehend<br>the sign, and so proceed to develop it.6</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:337;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1776">28.&nbsp;If he opens his eyes too wide, they get fatigued and the disk becomes too<br>obvious, which prevents the sign becoming apparent to him.

So he should develop it by<br>apprehending the sign (<i>nimitta</i>), keeping his eyes open moderately, as if he were<br>seeing the reflection of his face (<i>mukha-nimitta</i>) on the surface of a looking-<br>glass.7</span></nobr></DIV>

That is why,&nbsp;instead<br>of saying here, ‘should not be looked at,’ he says that it should not be apprehended by<br>reviewing.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:158;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1796">32.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;concentration is of two kinds, that is to say,&nbsp;access concentration and<br>absorption concentration: the mind becomes concentrated in two ways, that is,<br>on the plane of access and on the plane of obtainment. Herein, the mind becomes<br>concentrated on the plane of access by&nbsp;the abandonment of the hindrances, and<br>on the plane of obtainment by&nbsp;the manifestation of the jhāna factors.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:250;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1796">33.&nbsp;The difference between the two kinds of concentration is this. The factors<br>are not strong in access. It is because they are not strong that when access has<br>arisen, the mind now makes the sign its object and now re-enters the life-<br>continuum,13&nbsp;just as when a young child is lifted up and stood on its feet, it</span></nobr></DIV>

It is in order to answer that question that the sentence beginning, ‘For it is …’<br>is given. ‘Born of the perception’: produced by&nbsp;the perception during development,<br>simply born from the perception during development. Since there is no arising from<br>anywhere of what&nbsp;has no individual essence, he therefore said, ‘Being the mere mode<br>of appearance’” (Vism-mhṭ 122). See Ch.

The<br>“cognitive&nbsp;series”&nbsp;<i>(citta-vīthi)&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>so extensively used here is unknown as such in the<br>Piṭakas. Perhaps the seed from which it sprang may exist in, say,&nbsp;such passages as:<br>“Due to eye and to visible data eye-consciousness arises. The coincidence of the three<br>is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What he feels he perceives.&nbsp;What<br>he perceives he thinks about4. What he thinks about he diversifies [by means of<br>craving, pride and false view] … Due to mind and to mental data …” (M I 111). And: “Is<br>the eye permanent or impermanent … Are visible objects permanent or impermanent?<br>… Is the mind permanent or impermanent? Are mental data … Is mind-consciousness<br>… Is mind-contact … Is any feeling, any perception, any formation, any consciousness,<br>that arises with mind-contact as condition permanent or impermanent?” (M III 279).<br>And: “These five&nbsp;faculties [of eye,&nbsp;etc.] each with its separate objective&nbsp;field and no one<br>of them experiencing as its objective&nbsp;field the province of any other, have&nbsp;mind as their<br>refuge, and mind experiences their provinces as its objective&nbsp;field” (M I 295). This<br>treatment of consciousness implies,&nbsp;as it were, more than even a “double thickness”<br>of consciousness. An already-formed nucleus of the cognitive&nbsp;series, based on such<br>Sutta Piṭakas material, appears in the Abhidhamma Piṭakas. The following two<br>quotations show how the commentary (bracketed italics) expands the Abhidhamma<br>Piṭakas treatment.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:917;left:317"><nobr><span class="ft1830">125</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1830">45.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:104"><nobr><span class="ft1832"><i>2.</i>&nbsp;<i>Maintaining balanced faculties</i>&nbsp;is equalizing the [five] faculties of faith and</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:105;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1833">the rest. For if his faith faculty is strong and the others weak, then the energy<br>faculty cannot perform its function of exerting, the mindfulness faculty its<br>function of establishing, the concentration faculty its function of not distracting,<br>and the understanding faculty its function of seeing. So in that case the faith<br>faculty should be modified either by reviewing the individual essences of the<br>states [concerned, that is, the objects of attention] or by&nbsp;not giving [them] attention<br>in the way in which the faith faculty became too strong. And this is illustrated<br>by&nbsp;the story of the Elder Vakkali (S III 119).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1833">46.&nbsp;Then if the energy faculty is too strong, the faith faculty cannot perform its<br>function of resolving, nor can the rest of the faculties perform their several<br>functions. So in that case the energy faculty should be modified by&nbsp;developing<br>tranquillity, and so on. And this should be illustrated by&nbsp;the story of the Elder<br>Soṇa (Vin I 179–85; A III 374–76). So too with the rest; for it should be understood<br>that when anyone of them is too strong the others cannot perform their several<br>functions.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:375;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1830">47.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:375;left:106"><nobr><span class="ft1830">However,&nbsp;what&nbsp;is particularly recommended is balancing faith with</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:393;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1833">understanding, and concentration with energy. For one strong in faith and<br>weak in understanding has confidence uncritically and groundlessly. One<br>strong in understanding and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as<br>hard to cure as one sick of a disease caused by medicine. With the balancing of<br>the two a man has confidence only when there are grounds for it.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:484;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1833">Then idleness overpowers one strong in concentration and weak in energy, since<br>concentration favours idleness. [130] Agitation overpowers one strong in energy<br>and weak in concentration, since energy favours agitation. But concentration<br>coupled with energy cannot lapse into idleness, and energy coupled with<br>concentration cannot lapse into agitation. So these two should be balanced; for<br>absorption comes with the balancing of the two.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:593;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1830">48.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:593;left:105"><nobr><span class="ft1830">Again, [concentration and faith should be balanced]. One working on</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:611;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1833">concentration needs strong faith, since it is with such faith and confidence that<br>he reaches absorption. Then there is [balancing of] concentration and<br>understanding. One working on concentration needs strong unification, since<br>that is how he reaches absorption; and one working on insight needs strong<br>understanding, since that is how he reaches penetration of characteristics; but<br>with the balancing of the two he reaches absorption as well.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:720;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1830">49.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:720;left:105"><nobr><span class="ft1830">Strong mindfulness, however,&nbsp;is needed in all instances; for mindfulness</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:737;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1833">protects the mind from lapsing into agitation through faith, energy and<br>understanding, which favour agitation, and from lapsing into idleness through<br>concentration, which favours idleness. So it is as desirable in all instances as a<br>seasoning of salt in all sauces, as a prime minister in all the king’s business.<br>Hence it is said [in the commentaries (D-a 788, M-a I 292, etc)]: “And mindfulness<br>has been called universal by&nbsp;the Blessed One. For what&nbsp;reason? Because the<br>mind has mindfulness as its refuge, and mindfulness is manifested as protection,<br>and there is no exertion and restraint of the mind without mindfulness.”</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:332;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1880">67.&nbsp;Here is the explanation of the meaning.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:354;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft1880">When a too clever bee learns that a flower on a tree is blooming, it sets out</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:372;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1883">hurriedly, overshoots the mark, turns back, and arrives when the pollen is finished;<br>and another, not clever enough bee, who sets out with too slow a speed, arrives<br>when the pollen is finished too; but a clever bee sets out with balanced speed,<br>arrives with ease at&nbsp;the cluster of flowers, takes as much pollen as it pleases and<br>enjoys the honey-dew.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:463;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1883">68.&nbsp;Again, when a surgeon’s pupils are being trained in the use of the scalpel<br>on a lotus leaf in a dish of water, one who is too clever applies the scalpel<br>hurriedly and either cuts the lotus leaf in two or pushes it under the water, and<br>another who is not clever enough does not even dare to touch it with the scalpel<br>for fear of cutting it in two or pushing it under; but one who is clever shows the<br>scalpel stroke on it by&nbsp;means of a balanced effort, and being good at&nbsp;his craft he<br>is rewarded on such occasions.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:589;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1880">69.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:589;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1880">Again when the king announces, “Anyone who can draw&nbsp;out a spider’s</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:607;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1883">thread four fathoms long shall receive&nbsp;four thousand,” one man who is too<br>clever breaks the spider’s thread here and there by&nbsp;pulling it hurriedly,&nbsp;and<br>another who is not clever enough does not dare to touch it with his hand for fear<br>of breaking it, but a clever man pulls it out starting from the end with a balanced<br>effort, winds it on a stick, and so wins the prize.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:698;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1883">70.&nbsp;Again, a too clever [137] skipper hoists full sails in a high wind and sends his<br>ship adrift, and another, not clever enough skipper, lowers his sails in a light wind<br>and remains where he is, but a clever skipper hoists full sails in a light wind, takes<br>in half his sails in a high wind, and so arrives safely at&nbsp;his desired destination.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:772;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1883">71.&nbsp;Again, when a teacher says, “Anyone who fills the oil-tube without spilling<br>any oil will win a prize,” one who is too clever fills it hurriedly out of greed for<br>the prize, and he spills the oil, and another who is not clever enough does not<br>dare to pour the oil at&nbsp;all for fear of spilling it, but one who is clever fills it with<br>a balanced effort and wins the prize.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:864;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1883">72.&nbsp;Just as in these five&nbsp;similes, so too when the sign arises, one bhikkhu forces<br>his energy, thinking “I shall soon reach absorption.” Then his mind lapses into</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:917;left:308"><nobr><span class="ft1900">132</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1907">75.&nbsp;But omitting repetitions,19&nbsp;then either the first is the “preliminary work,”<br>the second “access,” the third “conformity,” and the fourth, “change-of-lineage,”<br>or else the first is “access,” the second “conformity,” and the third “change-of-<br>lineage.” Then either the fourth [in the latter case] or the fifth [in the former case]<br>is the absorption consciousness. For it is only either the fourth or the fifth that<br>fixes in absorption. And that is according as there is swift or sluggish direct-<br>knowledge. (cf. XXI.117) Beyond that, impulsion lapses and the life-continuum20<br>takes over.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1906">76.&nbsp;But the Abhidhamma scholar, the Elder Godatta, quoted this text: “Preceding<br>profitable states are a condition, as repetition condition, for succeeding profitable<br>states” (Paṭṭh I 5). Adding, “It is owing to the repetition condition that each<br>succeeding state is strong, so there is absorption also in the sixth and seventh.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:306;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1906">77.&nbsp;That is rejected by&nbsp;the commentaries with the remark that it is merely that<br>elder’s opinion, adding that, “It is only either in the fourth or the fifth21&nbsp;that there<br>is absorption. Beyond that, impulsion lapses. It is said to do so because of<br>nearness of the life-continuum.” And that has been stated in this way after<br>consideration, so it cannot be rejected. For just as a man who is running towards<br>a precipice and wants to stop cannot do so when he has his foot on the edge but<br>falls over it, so there can be no fixing in absorption in the sixth or the seventh<br>because of the nearness to the life-continuum. That is why it should be understood<br>that there is absorption only in the fourth or the fifth.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:502;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1908">19.&nbsp;See XVII.189 and note.<br>20.&nbsp;“The intention is that it is as if the sixth and seventh impulsions had lapsed since<br>impulsion beyond the fifth is exhausted. The elder’s opinion was that just as the first<br>impulsion, which lacks the quality of repetition, does not arouse change-of-lineage<br>because of its weakness, while the second or the third, which have&nbsp;the quality of<br>repetition, can do so because they are strong on that account, so too the sixth and<br>seventh fix in absorption owing to their strength due to their quality of repetition.<br>But it is unsupported by&nbsp;a sutta or by&nbsp;any teacher’s statement in conformity with<br>a sutta. And the text quoted is not a reason because strength due to the quality of<br>repetition is not a principle without exceptions&nbsp;<i>(anekantikattā);&nbsp;</i>for the first volition,<br>which is not a repetition, has result experienceable here and now,&nbsp;while the second<br>to the sixth, which are repetitions, have&nbsp;result experienceable in future becomings”<br>(Vism-mhṭ 135).<br>21.&nbsp;“‘<i>Either in the fourth or the fifth,’&nbsp;</i>etc., is said for the purpose of concluding [the<br>discussion] with a paragraph showing the correctness of the meaning already stated.—<br>Herein, if the sixth and seventh impulsions are said to have&nbsp;lapsed because impulsion<br>is exhausted, how does seventh-impulsion volition come to have&nbsp;result experienceable<br>in the next rebirth and to be of immediate effect on rebirth?—This is not owing to<br>strength got through a repetition condition.—What then?—It is owing to the difference<br>in the function’s position&nbsp;<i>(kiriyāvatthā).&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>For the function [of impulsion] has three<br>positions, that is, initial, medial and final. Herein, experienceability of result in the next<br>rebirth and immediateness of effect on rebirth are due to the last volition’s final<br>position, not to its strength … So the fact that the sixth and seventh lapse because<br>impulsion is used up cannot be objected to” (Vism-mhṭ 135).

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1926">dwell in the first jhāna even when not secluded from unprofitable things?—It<br>should not be regarded in that way.&nbsp;It is mentioned in the first phrase as the<br>escape from them; for this jhāna is the escape from sense desires since it surmounts<br>the sense-desire element and since it is incompatible with greed for sense desires,<br>according as it is said: “The escape from sense desires is this, that is to say,<br>renunciation” (D III 275). But in the second phrase [140] the word&nbsp;<i>eva&nbsp;</i>should be<br>adduced and taken as said, as in the passage, “Bhikkhus, only (<i>eva</i>) here is there<br>an ascetic, here a second ascetic” (M I 63). For it is impossible to enter upon and<br>dwell in jhāna unsecluded also from unprofitable things, in other words, the<br>hindrances other than that [sense desire]. So this word must be read in both<br>phrases thus: “Quite secluded from sense desires, quite secluded from<br>unprofitable things.” And although the word “secluded” as a general term<br>includes all kinds of seclusion, that is to say,&nbsp;seclusion by&nbsp;substitution of<br>opposites, etc., and bodily seclusion, etc.,23&nbsp;still only the three, namely, bodily<br>seclusion, mental seclusion, and seclusion by suppression (suspension) should<br>be regarded here.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:371;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1920">83.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:371;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft1920">But this term “sense desires” should be regarded as including all kinds,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:388;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1926">that is to say,&nbsp;sense desires as object as given in the Niddesa in the passage<br>beginning, “What are sense desires as object? They are agreeable visible objects<br>…” (Nidd I 1), and the sense desires as defilement given there too and in the<br>Vibhaṅga thus: “Zeal as sense desire (<i>kāma</i>), greed as sense desire, zeal and<br>greed as sense desire, thinking as sense desire, greed as sense desire, thinking<br>and greed as sense desire”24&nbsp;(Nidd I 2; Vibh 256). That being so, the words “quite<br>secluded from sense desires” properly mean “quite secluded from sense desires<br>as object,” and express bodily seclusion, while the words “secluded from<br>unprofitable things” properly mean “secluded from sense desires as defilement<br>or from all unprofitable things,” and express mental seclusion. And in this case<br>giving up of pleasure in sense desires is indicated by&nbsp;the first since it only<br>expresses seclusion from sense desires as object, while acquisition of pleasure</span></nobr></DIV>

The<br><i>three&nbsp;</i>(see e.g. Nidd I 26; M-a II 143) are bodily seclusion (retreat), mental seclusion<br>(jhāna), and seclusion from the substance or circumstances of becoming (Nibbāna).<br>24.&nbsp;Here&nbsp;<i>saṅkappa&nbsp;</i>(“thinking”) has the meaning of “hankering.”&nbsp;<i>Chanda, kāma&nbsp;</i>and<br><i>rāga&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>and their combinations need sorting out.&nbsp;<i>Chanda&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>(zeal, desire) is much used,<br>neutral in colour, good or bad according to context and glossed by&nbsp;“desire to act”;<br>technically also one of the four roads to power and four predominances.&nbsp;<i>Kāma&nbsp;</i>(sense<br>desire, sensuality) loosely represents enjoyment of the five&nbsp;sense pleasures (e.g.<br>sense-desire sphere). More narrowly it refers to sexual enjoyment (third of the Five<br>Precepts). Distinguished as subjective&nbsp;desire (defilement) and objective&nbsp;things that<br>arouse it (Nidd I 1; cf. Ch.

The figure “five&nbsp;cords of sense desire” signifies<br>simply these desires with the five&nbsp;sense objects that attract them.&nbsp;<i>Rāga&nbsp;</i>(greed) is the<br>general term for desire in its bad sense and identical with&nbsp;<i>lobha,&nbsp;</i>which latter, however,<br>appears technically as one of the three root-causes of unprofitable action.&nbsp;<i>Rāga&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>is<br>renderable also by “lust” in its general sense.&nbsp;<i>Kāmacchanda&nbsp;</i>(lust): a technical term for</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1930">This, firstly, is the method here when the words&nbsp;<i>from sense desires&nbsp;</i>are treated as</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:293;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1935">85.&nbsp;But if they are treated as referring to sense desires as defilement, then it is<br>simply just zeal for sense desires (<i>kāmacchanda</i>) in the various forms of zeal<br>(<i>chanda</i>), greed (<i>rāga</i>), etc., that is intended as “sense desires” (<i>kāma</i>) (§83, 2nd<br>quotation). [141] And although that [lust] is also included by&nbsp;[the word]<br>“unprofitable,” it is nevertheless stated separately in the Vibhaṅga in the way<br>beginning, “Herein, what&nbsp;are sense desires? Zeal as sense desire …” (Vibh 256)<br>because of its incompatibility with jhāna. Or, alternatively, it is mentioned in the<br>first phrase because it is sense desire as defilement and in the second phrase<br>because it is included in the “unprofitable.” And because this [lust] has various<br>forms, therefore “from sense desires” is said instead of “from sense desire.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:471;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft1930">86.</span></nobr></DIV>

For the<br>hindrances are the contrary opposites of the jhāna factors: what&nbsp;is meant is that<br>the jhāna factors are incompatible with them, eliminate them, abolish them. And<br>it is said accordingly in the&nbsp;<i>Peṭaka</i>&nbsp;(<i>Peṭakopadesa</i>): “Concentration is incompatible<br>with lust, happiness with ill will, applied thought with stiffness and torpor,<br>bliss with agitation and worry, and sustained thought with uncertainty” (not in<br><i>Peṭakopadesa</i>).</span></nobr></DIV>

And now,&nbsp;in<br>order to show the factors associated with it,&nbsp;<i>which is accompanied by applied and<br>sustained thought</i>&nbsp;is said. [142] Herein, applied thinking (<i>vitakkana</i>) is&nbsp;<i>applied<br>thought&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>(<i>vitakka</i>); hitting upon, is what&nbsp;is meant.25&nbsp;It has the characteristic of<br>directing the mind on to an object (mounting the mind on its object). Its function<br>is to strike at&nbsp;and thresh—for the meditator is said, in virtue of it, to have&nbsp;the<br>object struck at&nbsp;by&nbsp;applied thought, threshed by&nbsp;applied thought. It is manifested<br>as the leading of the mind onto an object. Sustained thinking (<i>vicaraṇa</i>) is&nbsp;<i>sustained<br>thought&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>(<i>vicāra</i>); continued sustainment (<i>anusañcaraṇa</i>), is what&nbsp;is meant. It has<br>the characteristic of continued pressure on (occupation with) the object. Its<br>function is to keep conascent [mental] states [occupied] with that.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:467;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1946">89.&nbsp;And, though sometimes not separate,&nbsp;<i>applied thought&nbsp;</i>is the first impact of<br>the mind in the sense that it is both gross and inceptive, like the striking of a bell.<br><i>Sustained thought&nbsp;</i>is the act of keeping the mind anchored, in the sense that it is<br>subtle with the individual essence of continued pressure, like the ringing of the<br>bell.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Applied thought&nbsp;</i>intervenes, being the interference of consciousness at&nbsp;the<br>time of first arousing [thought], like a bird’s spreading out its wings when<br>about to soar into the air, and like a bee’s diving towards a lotus when it is<br>minded to follow up the scent of it. The behaviour of&nbsp;<i>sustained thought&nbsp;</i>is quiet,<br>being the near non-interference of consciousness, like the bird’s planing with<br>outspread wings after soaring into the air, and like the bee’s buzzing above&nbsp;the<br>lotus after it has dived towards it.</span></nobr></DIV>

Likewise, when a potter has spun his wheel with a stroke on the<br>stick and is making a dish [143], his supporting hand is like&nbsp;<i>applied thought&nbsp;</i>and<br>his hand that moves back and forth is like&nbsp;<i>sustained thought</i>.

We&nbsp;shall hear the Dhamma and gain merit<br>for you.” So they went out. And though she wanted to go too, she could not well<br>object to what&nbsp;they said. She stepped out of the house onto a balcony and stood<br>looking at&nbsp;the Ákāsacetiya Shrine at&nbsp;Girikaṇḍaka lit by&nbsp;the moon. She saw the<br>offering of lamps at&nbsp;the shrine, and the four communities as they circumambulated<br>it to the right after making their offerings of flowers and perfumes; and she<br>heard the sound of the massed recital by&nbsp;the Community of Bhikkhus. Then she<br>thought: “How lucky they&nbsp;are to be able to go to the monastery and wander round<br>such a shrine terrace and listen to such sweet preaching of Dhamma!” Seeing the<br>shrine as a mound of pearls and arousing uplifting happiness, she sprang up into<br>the air, and before her parents arrived she came down from the air into the shrine<br>terrace, where she paid homage and stood listening to the Dhamma.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:162;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft1970">And wherever the two are associated, happiness is the contentedness at</span></nobr></DIV>

Happiness is included in the formations aggregate;<br>bliss is included in the feeling aggregate. If a man, exhausted31&nbsp;in a desert, saw<br>or heard about a pond on the edge of a wood, he would have&nbsp;happiness; if he<br>went into the wood’s shade and used the water, he would have&nbsp;bliss.

Or alternatively: (b) the words&nbsp;<i>happiness and bliss<br></i>(<i>pītisukhaṃ</i>) can be taken as “the happiness and the bliss” independently, like<br>“the Dhamma and the Discipline” (<i>dhammavinaya</i>), and so then it can be taken<br>as seclusion-born happiness-and-bliss of this jhāna, or in this jhāna; so in this<br>way it is the happiness and bliss [rather than the jhāna] that are born of seclusion.<br>For just as the words “born of seclusion” can [as at&nbsp;(a)] be taken as qualifying the<br>word “jhāna,” so too they can be taken here [as at&nbsp;(b)] as qualifying the expression<br>“happiness and bliss,” and then that [total expression] is predicated of this<br>[jhāna]. So it is also correct to call “happiness-and-bliss born-of-seclusion” a<br>single expression. In the Vibhaṅga it is stated in the way beginning, “This bliss<br>accompanied by this happiness” (Vibh 257). The meaning should be regarded<br>in the same way there too.</span></nobr></DIV>

M I 294). Herein, the abandoning of the five&nbsp;factors should be understood<br>as the abandoning of these five&nbsp;hindrances, namely, lust, ill will, stiffness and<br>torpor, agitation and worry, and uncertainty; for no jhāna arises until these have<br>been abandoned, and so they are called the factors of abandoning. For although<br>other unprofitable things too are abandoned at&nbsp;the moment of jhāna, still only<br>these are specifically obstructive&nbsp;to jhāna.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1980">105.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft1980">The mind affected through lust by&nbsp;greed for varied objective&nbsp;fields does</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:271;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1983">not become concentrated on an object consisting in unity, or being overwhelmed<br>by&nbsp;lust, it does not enter on the way to abandoning the sense-desire element.<br>When pestered by&nbsp;ill will towards an object, it does not occur uninterruptedly.<br>When overcome by&nbsp;stiffness and torpor, it is unwieldy. When seized by&nbsp;agitation<br>and worry, it is unquiet and buzzes about. When stricken by&nbsp;uncertainty, it fails<br>to mount the way to accomplish the attainment of jhāna. So it is these only that<br>are called factors of abandoning because they are specifically obstructive&nbsp;to<br>jhāna.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:415;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft1980">But applied thought directs the mind onto the object; sustained thought</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:432;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1983">keeps it anchored there. Happiness produced by the success of the effort refreshes<br>the mind whose effort has succeeded through not being distracted by those<br>hindrances; and bliss intensifies it for the same reason. Then unification aided<br>by&nbsp;this directing onto, this anchoring, this refreshing and this intensifying,<br>evenly and rightly centres (III.3) the mind with its remaining associated states<br>on the object consisting in unity.&nbsp;Consequently, possession of five&nbsp;factors should<br>be understood as the arising of these five, namely, applied thought, sustained<br>thought, happiness, bliss and unification of mind.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:576;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1980">107.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:576;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft1980">For it is when these are arisen that jhāna is said to be arisen, which is why</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:593;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1983">they are called the five&nbsp;factors of possession. Therefore it should not be assumed<br>that the jhāna is something other which possesses them. But just as “The army<br>with the four factors” (Vin IV 104) and “Music with the five&nbsp;factors” (M-a II 300)<br>and “The path with the eight factors (eightfold path)” are stated simply in terms<br>of their factors, so this too [147] should be understood as stated simply in terms<br>of its factors, when it is said to “have&nbsp;five&nbsp;factors” or “possess five&nbsp;factors.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:702;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1980">108.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:702;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft1980">And while these five&nbsp;factors are present also at&nbsp;the moment of access and</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:720;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1983">are stronger in access than in normal consciousness, they are still stronger here<br>than in access and acquire the characteristic of the fine-material sphere. For<br>applied thought arises here directing the mind on to the object in an extremely<br>lucid manner, and sustained thought does so pressing the object very hard, and<br>the happiness and bliss pervade the entire body. Hence it is said: “And there is<br>nothing of his whole body not permeated by&nbsp;the happiness and bliss born of<br>seclusion” (D I 73). And unification too arises in the complete contact with the<br>object that the surface of a box’s lid has with the surface of its base. This is how<br>they differ from the others.</span></nobr></DIV>

But the consciousness immediately before that [149] reaches<br>that state by&nbsp;way of change in a single continuity (cf.

And it is said that it&nbsp;<i>enters into that state</i>&nbsp;by&nbsp;approaching it through<br>having made way for it.

And when he has no more interest in again causing appearance of<br>unity in what&nbsp;has already appeared as unity through abandonment of its<br>association with defilement in making way for serenity, it is said that&nbsp;<i>he looks on<br>with equanimity at&nbsp;the appearance of unity</i>.

So too the meditator must<br>discern such modes as that of suitable food, etc., thus: “I attained this after<br>eating this food, attending on such a person, in such a lodging, in this posture<br>at&nbsp;this time.” In this way,&nbsp;when that [absorption] is lost, he will be able to recapture<br>those modes and renew the absorption, or while familiarizing himself with it he<br>will be able to repeat that absorption again and again.</span></nobr></DIV>

Or<br>alternatively: it evokes (<i>udāyati</i>) associated states, thus it is an evoker (<i>udi</i>); the<br>meaning is, it arouses. And that is unique (<i>eka</i>) in the sense of best, and it is an<br>evoker (<i>udi</i>), thus it is a unique evoker (<i>ekodi&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>= single). This is a term for<br>concentration. Then, since the second jhāna gives existingness to (<i>bhāveti</i>),<br>augments, this single [thing], it “gives singleness” (<i>ekodibhāva</i>). But as this<br>single [thing] is a mind’s, not a being’s or a soul’s, so singleness of mind is said.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2076">also this concentration with the name of the “single [thing]?” Then why is only<br>this second jhāna said to have&nbsp;confidence and singleness of mind?—It may be<br>replied as follows: It is because that first jhāna [157] is not fully confident owing<br>to the disturbance created by&nbsp;applied and sustained thought, like water ruffled<br>by&nbsp;ripples and wavelets. That is why,&nbsp;although faith does exist in it, it is not<br>called “confidence.” And there too concentration is not fully evident because of<br>the lack of full confidence. That is why it is not called “singleness” there. But in<br>this second jhāna faith is strong, having got a footing in the absence of the<br>impediments of applied and sustained thought; and concentration is also<br>evident through having strong faith as its companion. That may be understood<br>as the reason why only this jhāna is described in this way.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:428;left:113"><nobr><span class="ft2070">But that much is actually stated in the Vibhaṅga too with the words:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:445;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2076">“‘Confidence’ is faith, having faith, trust, full confidence. ‘Singleness of mind’<br>is steadiness of consciousness … right concentration” (Vibh 258). And this<br>commentary on the meaning should not be so understood as to conflict with the<br>meaning stated in that way,&nbsp;but on the contrary so as to agree and concur with it.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:519;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2070">146.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:519;left:114"><nobr><span class="ft2072"><i>Without applied thought, without sustained thought</i>: since it has been</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:537;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2076">abandoned by&nbsp;development, there is no applied thought in this, or of this, [jhāna],<br>thus it is without applied thought. The same explanation applies to sustained<br>thought. Also it is said in the Vibhaṅga: “So this applied thought and this<br>sustained thought are quieted, quietened, stilled, set at&nbsp;rest, set quite at&nbsp;rest,<br>done away&nbsp;with, quite done away&nbsp;with,43&nbsp;dried up, quite dried up, made an end<br>of; hence it is said: without applied thought, without sustained thought”<br>(Vibh 258).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:663;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft2070">Here it may be asked: Has not this meaning already been established by&nbsp;the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:680;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft2076">words “with the stilling of applied and sustained thought?” So why is it said<br>again “without applied thought, without sustained thoughts?”—It may be<br>replied: Yes,&nbsp;that meaning has already been established. But this does not indicate<br>that meaning. Did we&nbsp;not say earlier: “The phrase ‘with the stilling of applied<br>and sustained thought’ is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the act<br>of attaining the other jhānas, beginning with that of the second from the first, is<br>effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case?” (§140).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2083">singleness comes about, not as in access jhāna with the abandoning of the<br>hindrances, nor as in the first jhāna with the manifestation of the factors, but<br>with the act of stilling the applied and sustained thought. So that [first] clause<br>indicates the cause of the confidence and singleness. In the same way this jhāna<br>is without applied thought and without sustained thought, not as in the third<br>and fourth jhānas or as in eye-consciousness, etc., with just absence, but with<br>the actual act of stilling the applied and sustained thought. So that [first clause]<br>also indicates the cause of the state without applied and sustained thought; it<br>does not indicate the bare absence of applied and sustained thought. [158] The<br>bare absence of applied and sustained thought is indicated by&nbsp;this [second]<br>clause, namely, “without applied thought, without sustained thought.”<br>Consequently it needs to be stated notwithstanding that the first has already<br>been stated.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:319;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2080">148.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:336;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2083">associated concentration, is the meaning. Herein, although the first was born of<br>associated concentration too, still it is only this concentration that is quite worthy<br>to be called “concentration” because of its complete confidence and extreme<br>immobility due to absence of disturbance by applied and sustained thought. So<br>only this [jhāna] is called “born of concentration,” and that is in order to<br>recommend it.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:445;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft2082"><i>With happiness and bliss</i>&nbsp;is as already explained.&nbsp;<i>Second</i>: second in numerical</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:502;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2083"><i>factors&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>(§139). Herein, the abandoning of two factors should be understood<br>as the abandoning of applied thought and sustained thought. But while the<br>hindrances are abandoned at&nbsp;the moment of the access of the first jhāna, in<br>the case of this jhāna the applied thought and sustained thought are not<br>abandoned at&nbsp;the moment of its access. It is only at&nbsp;the moment of actual<br>absorption that the jhāna arises without them. Hence they are called its<br>factors of abandoning.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:645;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2083">three, that is, happiness, bliss, and unification of mind. So when it is said in the<br>Vibhaṅga, “‘Jhāna’: confidence, happiness, bliss, unification of mind” (Vibh<br>258), this is said figuratively in order to show that jhāna with its equipment. But,<br>excepting the confidence, this jhāna has literally three factors&nbsp;<i>qua&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>factors that<br>have&nbsp;attained to the characteristic of lighting (see §119), according as it is said:<br>“What is jhāna of three factors on that occasion? It is happiness,&nbsp;bliss, unification<br>of mind” (Vibh 263).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:772;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft2080">The rest is as in the case of the first jhāna.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:258;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2123">here. That has the characteristic of neutrality. Its function is to be unconcerned.<br>It is manifested as uninterestedness. Its proximate cause is the fading away&nbsp;of<br>happiness.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:315;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft2120">Here it may be said: Is this not simply equanimity as specific neutrality in the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:332;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2123">meaning? And that exists in the first and second jhānas as well; so this clause,<br>“He dwells in equanimity,” ought to be stated of those also. Why is it not?—[It<br>may be replied:] Because its function is unevident there since it is overshadowed<br>by applied thought and the rest. But it appears here with a quite evident function,<br>with head erect, as it were, because it is not overshadowed by&nbsp;applied thought<br>and sustained thought and happiness. That is why it is stated here.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:480;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft2120">Now,&nbsp;as to&nbsp;<i>mindful and fully aware</i>: here, he remembers (<i>sarati</i>), thus he is</span></nobr></DIV>

This is mindfulness and full awareness stated as personal attributes.<br>Herein, mindfulness has the characteristic of remembering. Its function is not to<br>forget. It is manifested as guarding.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:589;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2120">173.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:589;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft2120">Herein, although this mindfulness and this full awareness exist in the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:607;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2123">earlier jhānas as well—for one who is forgetful and not fully aware does not<br>attain even access, let alone absorption—yet, because of the [comparative]<br>grossness of those jhānas, the mind’s going is easy [there], like that of a man on<br>[level] ground, and so the functions of mindfulness and full awareness are not<br>evident in them. [163] But it is only stated here because the subtlety of this jhāna,<br>which is due to the abandoning of the gross factors, requires that the mind’s<br>going always includes the functions of mindfulness and full awareness, like<br>that of a man on a razor’s edge.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:750;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft2123">174.&nbsp;What is more, just as a calf that follows a cow returns to the cow when<br>taken away&nbsp;from her if not prevented, so too, when this third jhāna is led away<br>from happiness, it would return to happiness if not prevented by&nbsp;mindfulness<br>and full awareness, and would rejoin happiness. And besides, beings are greedy<br>for bliss, and this kind of bliss is exceedingly sweet since there is none greater.<br>But here there is non-greed for the bliss owing to the influence of the mindfulness<br>and full awareness, not for any other reason. And so it should also be understood<br>that it is stated only here in order to emphasize this meaning too.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:319;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft2150">It is said in that way there referring to reinforced cessation. For in the first</span></nobr></DIV>

Nor, they say,&nbsp;is there any conflict with the Paṭṭhāna text to be fancied<br>here, since what&nbsp;is shown there is only grief that occurs making lost jhāna its object<br>because the grief that occurs making its object a jhāna that has not been lost is not<br>relevant there. And they say that it cannot be maintained that grief does not arise at&nbsp;all<br>in those who have&nbsp;obtained jhāna since it did arise in Asita who had the eight attainments<br>(Sn 691), and he was not one who had lost jhāna. So they say.&nbsp;That is wrong because<br>there is no hate without the nature of a hindrance. If there were, it would arise in fine-<br>material and immaterial beings, and it does not. Accordingly when in such passages<br>as, ‘In the immaterial state, due to the hindrance of lust there is the hindrance of<br>stiffness and torpor … the hindrance of agitation, the hindrance of ignorance’ (Paṭṭh II<br>291), ill will and worry are not mentioned as hindrances, that does not imply that they<br>are not hindrances even by&nbsp;supposing that it was because lust, etc., were not actually<br>hindrances and were called hindrances there figuratively because of resemblance to<br>hindrances. And it is no reason to argue, ‘it is because it arose in Asita,’ since there is<br>falling away&nbsp;from jhāna with the arising of grief. The way to regard that is that when<br>the jhāna is lost for some trivial reason such men reinstate it without difficulty”<br>(Vism-mhṭ 158–59).</span></nobr></DIV>
