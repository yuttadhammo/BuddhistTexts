After that, he discerns as materiality the primary elements,<br>which are the heart’s support, and the remaining, derived kinds of materiality<br>that have&nbsp;the elements as their support. He defines all that as “materiality” (<i>rūpa</i>)<br>because it is “molested” (<i>ruppana</i>)<i>&nbsp;</i>[by cold, etc.]. After that he defines in brief as<br>“mentality-materiality” (<i>nāma</i>-<i>rūpa</i>) the mentality that has the characteristic of<br>“bending” and the materiality that has the characteristic of “being molested.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:337;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft6684"><i>[(b) Starting with Materiality]</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:359;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft6687">5.&nbsp;But one whose vehicle is pure insight, or that same aforesaid one whose vehicle<br>is serenity, discerns the four elements in brief or in detail in one of the various ways<br>given in the chapter on the definition of the four elements (XI.27ff.). Then, when the<br>elements have&nbsp;become clear in their correct essential characteristics, firstly<i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>in the<br>case of head hair originated by&nbsp;kamma there become plain ten instances of materiality<br>(<i>rūpāni</i>)<i>&nbsp;</i>with the body decad thus: the four elements, colour, odour, flavour, nutritive<br>essence, and life,&nbsp;and body sensitivity. And because the sex decad is present there<br>too there are another ten [that is, the same nine with sex instead of body sensitivity].<br>And since the octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth [that is, the four elements and<br>colour, odour, flavour, and nutritive&nbsp;essence,] originated by&nbsp;nutriment, and that<br>originated by&nbsp;temperature, and that originated by&nbsp;consciousness are present there<br>too, there are another twenty-four. So there is a total of forty-four instances of<br>materiality in the case of each of the twenty-four bodily parts of fourfold origination.<br>But in the case of the four, namely, sweat, tears, spittle, and snot,5&nbsp;which are originated</span></nobr></DIV>

There are seven kinds of decads: those of the physical basis of mind (heart),<br>sex, living, physical eye,&nbsp;ear, nose, tongue, and body. The first nine components of a<br>decad are the same in all instances, and by&nbsp;themselves they are called the “life&nbsp;ennead.”<br>The first eight components by&nbsp;themselves are called the “octad-with-nutritive-essence-<br>as-eighth.” This octad plus sound is called the “sound ennead.” In general these are<br>called “material groups” (<i>rūpa</i>-<i>kalāpa</i>). But this kind of group (<i>kalāpa</i>) has nothing to<br>do with the “comprehension by groups” (<i>kalāpa</i>-<i>sammasana</i>) of Ch. XX, which is simply<br>generalization (from one’s own particular experience to each of the five&nbsp;aggregates as<br>past, etc., i.e. as a “group”). The “material groups” are not in the Piṭakas.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:193;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft6715">13.&nbsp;Another defines it more briefly than that by&nbsp;means of the aggregates. How?<br>Here a bhikkhu defines as “the materiality aggregate” all the following twenty-<br>seven instances of materiality, that is, the seventeen instances of materiality<br>consisting of the four primaries of fourfold origination in this body and<br>dependent colour, odour, flavour, and nutritive&nbsp;essence, and the five&nbsp;sensitivities<br>beginning with the eye sensitivity, and the materiality of the physical [heart-<br>]basis, sex, life faculty, and sound of twofold origination, which seventeen<br>instances of materiality are suitable for comprehension since they are produced<br>and are instances of concrete materiality; and then the ten instances of materiality,<br>that is, bodily intimation, verbal intimation, the space element, and the lightness,<br>malleability, wieldiness, growth, continuity, aging, and impermanence of<br>materiality, which ten instances of materiality are, however,&nbsp;not suitable for<br>comprehension since they are merely the mode-alteration and the limitation-of-<br>interval; they are not produced and are not concrete materiality, but they are<br>reckoned as materiality because they are mode-alterations, and limitation-of-<br>interval, of various instances of materiality. So he defines all these twenty-seven<br>instances of materiality as the “the materiality aggregate.” He defines the feeling<br>that arises together with the eighty-one kinds of mundane consciousness as the<br>“feeling aggregate,” the perception associated therewith as the “perception<br>aggregate,” the formations associated therewith as the “formations aggregate,”<br>and the consciousness as the “consciousness aggregate.” So by&nbsp;defining the<br>materiality aggregate as “materiality” and the four immaterial aggregates as<br>“mentality,” he defines mentality-materiality by&nbsp;means of the five&nbsp;aggregates.</span></nobr></DIV>

There follows a long paragraph showing how the<br>concepts of these systems are to be assimilated into mentality-materiality whereby<br>they lose their significance and are shown to be impermanent and formed. Vism-mhṭ<br>concludes by&nbsp;saying, “Wherever the verbal meaning of self is expressed by&nbsp;some<br>such metaphor as world-soul (<i>purisa</i>), self (<i>attā</i>,<i>&nbsp;ātman</i>), soul (<i>jīva</i>), etc., these being<br>themselves conceived in their various ways on the basis of mere mentality-materiality,<br>are mere mentality-materiality, too” (Vism-mhṭ 754f.).</span></nobr></DIV>

The vision of one who sees in this way is called<br>correct vision.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:707;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft6753">29.&nbsp;But when a man rejects this correct vision and assumes that a [permanent]<br>being exists, he has to conclude either that it comes to be annihilated or that it<br>does not. If he concludes that it does not come to be annihilated, he falls into the<br>eternity [view]. If he concludes that it does come to be annihilated, he falls into<br>the annihilation [view]. Why? Because [the assumption] precludes any gradual<br>change like that of milk into curd. So he either holds back, concluding that the<br>assumed being is eternal, or he overreaches, concluding that it comes to be<br>annihilated.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft6763">some overreach; only those with eyes see. And how do some hold back? Deities<br>and human beings love&nbsp;becoming, delight in becoming, rejoice in becoming.<br>When Dhamma is taught to them for the ceasing of becoming, their minds do<br>not enter into it, become settled, steady and resolute. Thus it is that some hold<br>back. And how do some overreach? Some are ashamed, humiliated and disgusted<br>by&nbsp;that same becoming, they are concerned with non-becoming in this way:<br>‘Sirs, when with the breakup of the body this self is cut off, annihilated, does not<br>become any more after death, that is peaceful, that is sublime, that is true.’ Thus<br>it is that some overreach. And how do those with eyes see? Here a bhikkhu sees<br>what&nbsp;is become as become. Having seen what&nbsp;is become as become, he has<br>entered upon the way to dispassion for it, to the fading away&nbsp;of greed for it, to its<br>cessation.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:550;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft6763">marionette, but also by&nbsp;means of the analogies of the sheaves of reeds and so on.<br>For just as when two sheaves of reeds are propped one against the other, each<br>one gives the other consolidating support, and when one falls the other falls, so<br>too, in the five-constituent becoming mentality-materiality occurs as an<br>interdependent state, each of its components giving the other consolidating<br>support, and when one falls owing to death, the other falls too.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:350;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft6773">Due to a cause …<br>The pentad based on contact comes not from the body,<br>Or yet from touch, or something that is in between;<br>Due to a cause …</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:498;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft6773">34.&nbsp;Furthermore, mentality has no efficient power,&nbsp;it cannot occur by&nbsp;its own<br>efficient power.&nbsp;It does not eat, it does not drink, it does not speak, it does not<br>adopt postures. And materiality is without efficient power;&nbsp;it cannot occur by&nbsp;its<br>own efficient power.&nbsp;For it has no desire to eat, it has no desire to drink, it has no<br>desire to speak, it has no desire to adopt postures. But rather it is when supported<br>by&nbsp;materiality that mentality occurs; and it is when supported by&nbsp;mentality that<br>materiality occurs. When mentality has the desire to eat, the desire to drink, the<br>desire to speak, the desire to adopt a posture, it is materiality that eats, drinks,<br>speaks, and adopts a posture.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:659;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft6773">35.&nbsp;But for the purpose of explaining this meaning they gave&nbsp;this simile as an<br>example: a man born blind and a stool-crawling cripple wanted to go somewhere.<br>The blind man said to the cripple, “Look, I can do what&nbsp;should be done by&nbsp;legs,<br>but I have&nbsp;no eyes with which to see what&nbsp;is rough and smooth.” The cripple<br>said, “Look, I can do what&nbsp;should be done by&nbsp;eyes, but I have&nbsp;no legs with which<br>to go and come.” The blind man was delighted, and he made the cripple climb<br>up on his shoulder. Sitting on the blind man’s shoulder the cripple spoke thus,<br>“Leave&nbsp;the left, take the right; leave&nbsp;the right, take the left.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:803;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft6770">Herein, the blind man has no efficient power;&nbsp;he is impotent; he cannot travel</span></nobr></DIV>

And the cripple has no efficient<br>power;&nbsp;he is impotent; he cannot travel by&nbsp;his own efficient power,&nbsp;by&nbsp;his own<br>strength. But there is nothing to prevent their going when they support each<br>other. So too, mentality has no efficient power;&nbsp;it does not arise or occur in such</span></nobr></DIV>
