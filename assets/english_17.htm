But as regards the last<br>three, the first is called the “I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown” faculty because<br>it arises in the initial stage [of the stream-entry path moment] in one who has<br>entered on the way thus “I shall come to know the deathless state, or the Dhamma<br>of the Four (Noble) Truths, not known,”1&nbsp;and because it carries the meaning of<br>faculty (rulership). The second of them is called the final-knowledge faculty<br>because of knowing finally, and because it carries the meaning of faculty. The<br>third is called the final-knower faculty because it arises in one who has destroyed<br>cankers, who possesses final knowledge, and whose task of getting to know the<br>four truths is finished, and because it carries the meaning of faculty.</span></nobr></DIV>

That of the faculties of faith, etc., is<br>to overcome opposition and to impart to associated states the mode of confidence<br>and so on. That of the “I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown” faculty is both to<br>abandon three fetters and to confront associated states with the abandonment of<br>them.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:105;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5696">For there are many kinds of suffering, that is to say,&nbsp;intrinsic suffering (<i>dukkha</i>-<br><i>dukkha</i>),9&nbsp;suffering in change (<i>vipariṇāma</i>-<i>dukkha</i>), and suffering due to<br>formations (<i>saṅkhāra</i>-<i>dukkha</i>); and then concealed suffering, exposed suffering,<br>indirect suffering, and direct suffering.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5690">35.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:105"><nobr><span class="ft5690">Herein, bodily and mental, painful feeling are called&nbsp;<i>intrinsic suffering</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:197;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5696">because of their individual essence, their name, and their painfulness. [Bodily<br>and mental] pleasant feeling are called&nbsp;<i>suffering in change&nbsp;</i>because they are a<br>cause for the arising of pain when they change (M I 303). Equanimous feeling<br>and the remaining formations of the three planes are called&nbsp;<i>suffering due to<br>formations&nbsp;</i>because they are oppressed by rise and fall. Such bodily and mental<br>affliction as earache, toothache, fever born of lust, fever born of hate, etc., is called<br><i>concealed suffering&nbsp;</i>because it can only be known by&nbsp;questioning and because the<br>infliction is not openly evident; it is also called “unevident suffering.” The<br>affliction produced by&nbsp;the thirty<i>-</i>two tortures,10&nbsp;etc., is called&nbsp;<i>exposed suffering<br></i>because it can be known without questioning and because the infliction is openly<br>evident; it is also called “evident suffering.” Except intrinsic suffering, all given<br>in the exposition of the truth of suffering [in the Vibhaṅga] (Vibh 99) beginning</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:442;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5694">8.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:442;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft5694">“The question, “<i>But why is it suffering</i>?” means this: granted firstly that birth in</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:458;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5698">hell is painful, since hell is unalloyed pain, and that it is painful in the other unhappy<br>destinies since it is originated by&nbsp;bad kamma; but how is it so in the happy destinies<br>since it is there originated by&nbsp;kamma that leads to bliss? The answer, “<i>Because it is the<br>basis for many kinds of suffering</i>”, etc., shows that this birth is not called suffering<br>because of having suffering as its individual essence—for there is no rebirth<i>-</i>linking<br>associated with painful feeling—but rather because it is the foundation for suffering”<br>(Vism-mhṭ 528).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:571;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft5694">Something must be said here about the words&nbsp;<i>dukkha</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>sukha,</i>&nbsp;the former being</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:588;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5698">perhaps the hardest after&nbsp;<i>dhamma</i>&nbsp;to render into English.&nbsp;<i>Dukkha</i>&nbsp;is consistently<br>rendered by&nbsp;either the vaguer general term “suffering” or by&nbsp;the more specific “[bodily]<br>pain.” Different, but overlapping, ideas are expressed. The latter needs no explanation;<br>but “suffering” must be stretched to include the general insecurity of the whole of<br>experience, of the impermanent world. For this, “uneasiness” would certainly be<br>preferable (“ill” is sometimes used), but multiplication of renderings is to be avoided<br>as much as possible; local accuracy is only too often gained at&nbsp;the cost of general<br>disorientation in a work&nbsp;of this sort, with these very general words capable of sharp<br>focusing. Again,&nbsp;<i>sukha</i>&nbsp;has been rendered as either “bliss” or “pleasure,” though the<br>latter does not at&nbsp;all necessarily imply any hedonism construed with sensual pleasure<br>(<i>kāma</i>). Again, “ease” (in the sense of relief) is in many ways preferable for the first<br>sense but has not been used for the reason already given.<br>9.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:782;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft5694">“Since also what&nbsp;does not have&nbsp;suffering as its individual essence is yet called</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:798;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5698">suffering indirectly, consequently ‘intrinsic suffering’ (<i>dukkha</i>-<i>dukkha</i>) is said<br>particularizing what&nbsp;does have&nbsp;suffering as its individual essence, just as in the case of<br>particularizing ‘concrete matter’” (<i>rūpa-rūpa</i>) (see 14.77) (Vism-mhṭ 528). For these<br>three kinds see S IV 259.<br>10.&nbsp;See MN 13 and 129, though it is not clear where the figure “thirty-two”<i>&nbsp;</i>is taken<br>from.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:127;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft5706">36.&nbsp;Herein, this birth is suffering because it is the basis for the suffering in the<br>states of loss as made evident by&nbsp;the Blessed One by&nbsp;means of a simile in the<br>Bālapaṇḍita Sutta (M III 165f.), etc., and for the suffering that arises in the happy<br>destinies in the human world and is classed as “rooted in the descent into the<br>womb,” and so on. [500]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:219;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft5706">37.&nbsp;Here the suffering classed as “rooted in the descent into the womb,” and so on,<br>is this: When this being is born in the mother’s womb, he is not born inside a blue or<br>red or white lotus, etc., but on the contrary, like a worm in rotting fish, rotting dough,<br>cesspools, etc., he is born in the belly in a position that is below the receptacle for<br>undigested food (stomach), above&nbsp;the receptacle for digested food (rectum), between<br>the belly-lining and the backbone, which is very cramped, quite dark, pervaded by<br>very fetid draughts redolent of various smells of ordure, and exception-ally<br>loathsome.11&nbsp;And on being reborn there, for ten months he undergoes excessive<br>suffering, being cooked like a pudding in a bag by&nbsp;the heat produced in the mother’s<br>womb, and steamed like a dumpling of dough, with no bending, stretching, and so<br>on. So this, firstly, is the suffering rooted in the descent into the womb.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:415;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft5706">38.&nbsp;When the mother suddenly stumbles or moves or sits down or gets up or<br>turns round, the extreme suffering he undergoes by being dragged back and<br>forth and jolted up and down, like a kid fallen into the hands of a drunkard, or<br>like a snake’s young fallen into the hands of a snake<i>-</i>charmer; and also the<br>searing pain that he undergoes, as though he had reappeared in the cold hells,<br>when his mother drinks cold water, and as though deluged by&nbsp;a rain of embers<br>when she swallows hot rice gruel, rice, etc., and as though undergoing the<br>torture of the “lye<i>-</i>pickling” (see M I 87), when she swallows anything salty or<br>acidic, etc.—this is the suffering rooted in gestation.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:576;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft5706">39.&nbsp;When the mother has an abortion, the pain that arises in him through the<br>cutting and rending in the place where the pain arises that is not fit to be seen<br>even by&nbsp;friends and intimates and companions—this is the suffering rooted in<br>abortion.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:650;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft5706">40.&nbsp;The pain that arises in him when the mother gives birth, through his being<br>turned upside<i>-</i>down by&nbsp;the kamma<i>-</i>produced winds [forces] and flung into that<br>most fearful passage from the womb, like an infernal chasm, and lugged out<br>through the extremely narrow&nbsp;mouth of the womb, like an elephant through a<br>keyhole, like a denizen of hell being pounded to pulp by&nbsp;colliding rocks—this is<br>the suffering rooted in parturition.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:358;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft5787">16.&nbsp;“‘<i>On coming to that&nbsp;</i>(<i>taṃ āgamma</i>)’: on reaching that Nibbāna by&nbsp;making it the<br>object” (Vism-mhṭ 533).&nbsp;<i>Ágamma&nbsp;</i>(ger. of&nbsp;<i>āgacchati—</i>to come) is commonly used as an<br>adverb in the sense of “owing to” (e.g. at&nbsp;M I 119). Here, however,&nbsp;it is taken literally by<br>the Commentaries and forms an essential part of the ontological proof of the positive<br>existence of Nibbāna. The&nbsp;<i>Sammohavinodanī</i>&nbsp;(commentary on the Áyatana-Vibhaṅga<br>Abhidhamma-bhājaniya) refutes the suggestion of a disputant (<i>vitaṇḍavādin</i>) who<br>asserts that Nibbāna is “mere destruction” (<i>khayamatta</i>). The arguments used are<br>merely supplementary to those in §69 here, and so are not quoted. The conclusion of<br>the argument is worth noting, however,&nbsp;because of the emphasis on the words “<i>taṃ<br>āgamma</i>.” It is this: “It is on coming to Nibbāna that greed, etc., are destroyed. It is the<br>same Nibbāna that is called ‘destruction of greed, destruction of hate, destruction of<br>delusion.’ These are just three terms for Nibbāna—When this was said, he asked: You<br>say ‘On coming to’ (<i>āgamma</i>); from where have&nbsp;you got this ‘on coming to’?—It is got<br>from the Suttas—Quote the sutta—‘Thus ignorance and craving, on coming to that,<br>are destroyed in that, are abolished in that, nor does anything anywhere … (<i>evaṃ avijjā<br>ca taṇhā ca taṃ āgamma tamhi khīṇaṃ tamhi bhaggaṃ na ca kiñci kadāci</i>&nbsp;… ).’<i>&nbsp;</i>When this was<br>said, the other was silent.” The quotation has not been traced.<br>17.&nbsp;<i>Nippapañca&nbsp;</i>(non-diversification) is one of the synonyms for Nibbāna. The word<br><i>papañca&nbsp;</i>is commonly used in the Commentaries in the sense (a) of an impediment or<br>obstacle (Dhp-a I 18), and (b) as a delay,&nbsp;or diffuseness (XVII.73). The sense in which<br>the word is used in the Suttas is that of diversifying and is best exemplified at&nbsp;M I 111:<br>“Friends, due to eye and to a visible object eye-consciousness arises. The coincidence<br>of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What a man feels that<br>he perceives.&nbsp;What he perceives he thinks about. What he thinks about he diversifies<br>(<i>papañceti</i>). Owing to his having diversified, the evaluation of diversifying perceptions<br>besets a man with respect to past, future, and present visible objects,” and so on. This<br>kind of&nbsp;<i>papañca</i>&nbsp;is explained by&nbsp;the Commentaries as “due to craving, pride and<br>views” (M-a I 25; II 10; II 75, etc.), and it may be taken as the diversifying action, the<br>choosing and rejecting, the approval and disapproval (M I 65), exercised by&nbsp;craving,<br>etc., on the bare material supplied by&nbsp;perception and thought. Consequently, though<br>it is bound up with craving, etc., a false emphasis is given in rendering&nbsp;<i>papañca</i>&nbsp;in<br>these contexts by&nbsp;“obsession” as is done in PED.&nbsp;<i>Nippapañca</i>&nbsp;as a term for Nibbāna<br>emphasizes the absence of that.</span></nobr></DIV>

And it is not futile because it does reach Nibbāna.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:323;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft5790">[Q. 2] But futility of the way does not follow because what&nbsp;is reached is absence,</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:374;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5818">assertion that Nibbāna is mythical and non-existent; questions five&nbsp;to seven refute the<br>assertion that Nibbāna is “mere destruction;” (further argued in the&nbsp;<i>Sammohavinodanī—<br></i>Vibh-a 51f.) the remaining questions deal with the proof that only Nibbāna (and not<br>the atom, etc.,) is permanent because uncreated.</span></nobr></DIV>

However,&nbsp;only the following<br>paragraph will be quoted here, which is reproduced in the commentaries to Ud 80 and<br>It 37. (The last sentence marked ** appears only in the Udāna Commentary. Readings<br>vary considerably):</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:520;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft5814">“Now,&nbsp;in the ultimate sense the existingness of the Nibbāna-element has been</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:536;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5818">demonstrated by&nbsp;the Fully Enlightened One, compassionate for the whole world, by<br>many sutta passages such as ‘Dhammas without condition,’ ‘Unformed dhammas’<br>(see Dhs 2), ‘Bhikkhus, there is that base (sphere) where neither earth … ’ (Ud 80),<br>‘This state is very hard to see, that is to say,&nbsp;the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing<br>of all substance of becoming’ (D II 36; M I 167), ‘Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the<br>unformed and the way leading to the unformed’ (S IV 362), and so on, and in this<br>sutta, ‘Bhikkhus, there is an unborn …” (It 87; Ud 80). So even if the wise trust<br>completely in the Dispensation and have&nbsp;no doubts, though they may not yet have&nbsp;had<br>direct perception of it, nevertheless there are persons who come to understand through<br>another’s guidance (reading&nbsp;<i>paraneyya</i>-<i>buddhino</i>); and the intention here is that this<br>logical reasoning under the heading of deduction (<i>niddhāraṇa</i>)<i>&nbsp;</i>should be for the purpose<br>of removing their doubts.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:730;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft5814">“Just as it is owing to full-understanding (reading&nbsp;<i>yathā pariññeyyatāya</i>) that from</span></nobr></DIV>

So, because the kind of knowledge that has formed dhammas as its object and that<br>which has conventional truth as its object are both incapable of abandoning defilements<br>by&nbsp;cutting them off, there must [consequently] exist an object for the noble-path-<br>knowledge that effects their abandonment by&nbsp;cutting them off, [which object must be]<br>of a kind opposite to both. And it is this that is the unformed element.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:652;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft5826">unformed’ and so on, which demonstrate the existingness of Nibbāna in the ultimate<br>sense, are not misleading because they are spoken by&nbsp;the Blessed One, like the words,<br>‘All formations are impermanent, all formations are painful, all&nbsp;<i>dhammas&nbsp;</i>(states) are<br>not self’<i>&nbsp;</i>(Dhp 277–79; A I 286, etc.).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5890">98.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:104"><nobr><span class="ft5890">For the three states beginning with right effort, which are born together,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:197;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5893">are like the three friends who enter the park together. The object is like the<br>champak tree in full blossom. Concentration, which cannot of its own nature<br>bring about absorption by&nbsp;unification on the object, is like the man who could<br>not pick the flower by&nbsp;raising his arm. Effort is like the companion who bent<br>down, giving his back to mount upon. Mindfulness is like the friend who stood<br>by, giving his shoulder for support. Just as standing on the back of the one and<br>supporting himself on the other’s shoulder he could pick as many flowers as he<br>wanted, so too, when energy accomplishes its function of exerting and when<br>mindfulness accomplishes its function of preventing wobbling, with the help so<br>obtained concentration can bring about absorption by&nbsp;unification on the object.<br>So here in the concentration aggregate it is only concentration that is included<br>as of the same kind. But effort and mindfulness are included because of their<br>action [in assisting].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:428;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5890">99.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:428;left:105"><nobr><span class="ft5890">Also as regards right view and right thinking, understanding cannot of</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:445;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5893">its own nature define an object as impermanent, painful, not<i>-</i>self. But with<br>applied thought giving [assistance] by&nbsp;repeatedly hitting [the object] it can.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:484;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5890">100.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:484;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft5890">How? Just as a money changer, having a coin placed in his hand and</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:502;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5893">being desirous of looking at&nbsp;it on all sides equally, cannot turn it over with the<br>power of his eye only, but by&nbsp;turning it over with his fingers he is able to look at&nbsp;it<br>on all sides, similarly understanding cannot of its own nature define an object<br>as impermanent and so on. But [assisted] by applied thought with its<br>characteristic of directing the mind on to [the object] and its function of striking<br>and threshing, as it were, hitting and turning over, it can take anything given<br>and define it. So here in the understanding aggregate it is only right view that is<br>included as of the same kind. But right thinking is included because of its<br>action [in assisting].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:663;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5890">101.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:663;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft5890">So the path is included by&nbsp;the three aggregates. Hence it was said that it is</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:680;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5893">of three kinds classed according to the three aggregates. And it is of four kinds<br>as the path of stream-entry and so on.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:720;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5890">102.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:720;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft5890">In addition, all the truths are of one kind because they are not unreal, or</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:737;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft5893">because they must be directly known. They are of two kinds as (i and ii) mundane<br>and (iii and iv) supramundane, or (i, ii, and iv) formed and (iii) unformed. They<br>are of three kind as (ii) to be abandoned by&nbsp;seeing and development, (iii and iv)<br>not to be abandoned, and (i) neither to be abandoned nor not to be abandoned.<br>They are of four kinds classed according to what&nbsp;has to be fully understood, and<br>so on (see §28).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:846;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft5890">This is how the exposition should be understood as to singlefold and so on.</span></nobr></DIV>
