So, in order to surmount that, he enters upon the<br>fourth jhāna in any one of the nine kasiṇas beginning with the earth kasiṇa and<br>omitting the limited-space kasiṇa.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:531;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft3797">2.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;although he has already surmounted gross physical matter by&nbsp;means<br>of the fourth jhāna of the fine-material sphere, nevertheless he still wants also to<br>surmount the kasiṇa materiality since it is the counterpart of the former. How<br>does he do this?</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:605;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft3797">3.&nbsp;Suppose a timid man is pursued by a snake in a forest and flees from it as<br>fast as he can, then if he sees in the place he has fled to a palm leaf with a streak<br>painted on it or a creeper or a rope or a crack in the ground, he is fearful, anxious<br>and will not even look at&nbsp;it. Suppose again a man is living in the same village as<br>a hostile man who ill-uses him and on being threatened by&nbsp;him with a flogging<br>and the burning down of his house, he goes away&nbsp;to live&nbsp;in another village, then<br>if he meets another man there of similar appearance, voice and manner, he is<br>fearful, anxious and will not even look at&nbsp;him.</span></nobr></DIV>

[327] The time when the bhikkhu<br>surmounts the gross physical matter by&nbsp;means of the fourth jhāna of the fine-<br>material sphere is like the first man’s fleeing as fast as he can and the other<br>man’s going away&nbsp;to another village.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft3816">11.&nbsp;There is, however,&nbsp;this difference. When the immaterial-sphere conscious-<br>ness has arisen in this way,&nbsp;the bhikkhu, who has been formerly looking at&nbsp;the<br>kasiṇa disk with the jhāna eye finds himself looking at&nbsp;only space after that sign<br>has been abruptly removed by&nbsp;the attention given in the preliminary work&nbsp;thus<br>“space, space.” He is like a man who has plugged an opening in a [covered]<br>vehicle, a sack or a pot2&nbsp;with a piece of blue rag or with a piece of rag of some<br>such colour as yellow,&nbsp;red or white and is looking at&nbsp;that, and then when the rag<br>is removed by&nbsp;the force of the wind or by&nbsp;some other agency, he finds himself<br>looking at&nbsp;space.</span></nobr></DIV>

For (a) the jhāna of the fine-material sphere is called “matter”<br>in such passages as “Possessed of visible matter he sees instances of matter” (D<br>II 70; M II 12), and (b) it is its object too [that is called “matter”] in such passages<br>as “He sees instances of visible matter externally … fair and ugly” (D II 110; M<br>II 13).3&nbsp;Consequently, here the words “perception of matter” (<i>rūpa</i>-<i>saññā—</i>lit.<br>“matter-perceptions”), in the sense of “perceptions about matter,” are used (a)<br>for fine-material jhāna stated thus under the headings of “perceptions.” [Also]<br>(b) it has the label (<i>saññā</i>) “matter” (<i>rūpa</i>), thus it (the jhāna’s object) is “labelled<br>matter” (<i>rūpa</i>-<i>saññā</i>); what&nbsp;is meant is that “matter” is its name. So it should be<br>understood that this is also a term for (b) what&nbsp;is classed as the earth kasiṇa, etc.,<br>which is the object of that [jhāna].4&nbsp;[329]</span></nobr></DIV>

With the fading away&nbsp;and with the cessation, both because of the fading<br>away&nbsp;and because of the cessation, either in all aspects or without exception, of<br>these perceptions of matter, reckoned as jhāna, which number fifteen with the<br>[five&nbsp;each of the] profitable, resultant and functional,5&nbsp;and also of these things<br>labelled matter, reckoned as objects [of those perceptions], which number nine<br>with the earth kasiṇa, etc., (§1) he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting<br>of boundless space.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft3825">15.&nbsp;Herein, there is no surmounting of these perceptions in one whose greed<br>for the object [of those perceptions] has not faded away; and when the perceptions<br>have&nbsp;been surmounted, their objects have&nbsp;been surmounted as well. That is why<br>in the Vibhaṅga only the surmounting of the perceptions and not that of the<br>objects is mentioned as follows: “Herein, what&nbsp;are perceptions of matter? They<br>are the perception, perceiving, perceivedness, in one who has attained a fine-<br>material-sphere attainment or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is<br>abiding in bliss there in this present life.&nbsp;These are what&nbsp;are called perceptions<br>of matter. These perceptions of matter are passed, surpassed, surmounted. Hence,<br>‘With the complete surmounting of perceptions of matter’ is said” (Vibh 261).<br>But this commentary should be understood to deal also with the surmounting<br>of the object because these attainments have&nbsp;to be reached by&nbsp;surmounting the<br>object; they are not to be reached by retaining the same object as in the first and<br>subsequent jhānas.</span></nobr></DIV>

Perceptions of visible objects,<br>perceptions of sounds, perceptions of odours, perceptions of flavours, perceptions<br>of tangible objects—these are called ‘perceptions of resistance’” (Vibh 261);<br>with the complete disappearance, the abandoning, the non-arising, of these ten<br>kinds of perceptions of resistance, that is to say,&nbsp;of the five&nbsp;profitable-resultant<br>and five&nbsp;unprofitable-resultant;6&nbsp;causing their non-occurrence, is what&nbsp;is meant.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:676;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft3825">17.&nbsp;Of course, these are not to be found in one who has entered upon the first<br>jhāna, etc., either; for consciousness at&nbsp;that time does not occur by&nbsp;way of the five<br>doors. Still [330] the mention of them here should be understood as a<br>recommendation of this jhāna for the purpose of arousing interest in it, just as in<br>the case of the fourth jhāna there is mention of the pleasure and pain already<br>abandoned elsewhere, and in the case of the third path there is mention of the<br>[false] view of personality, etc., already abandoned earlier.</span></nobr></DIV>

For when<br>he enters upon and dwells in this jhāna there too, he does so by&nbsp;non-attention to<br>them also, but he has not attained when he does give&nbsp;attention to them.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:419;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft3903">49.&nbsp;The word meaning here is this: that jhāna with its associated states neither<br>has perception nor has no perception because of the absence of gross perception<br>and the presence of subtle perception, thus it is “neither perception nor non-<br>perception” (<i>n’ eva</i>-<i>saññā-nāsaññaṃ</i>).

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:917;left:266"><nobr><span class="ft3930">335</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft3933">62.&nbsp;This is how the meaning should be construed. There was a tent in a dirty<br>place, it seems. Then a man arrived, and being disgusted with the dirt, he rested<br>himself on the tent with his hands and remained as if hung or hanging on to it.<br>Then another man came and leant upon the man hanging on to the tent. Then<br>another man came and thought, “The one who is hanging on to the tent and the<br>one who is leaning upon him are both badly off, and if the tent falls they will<br>certainly fall. I think I shall stand outside.” [340] So instead of leaning upon the<br>one leaning upon the first, he remained outside. Then another arrived, and<br>taking account of the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one<br>leaning upon him, and fancying that the one standing outside was well placed,<br>he stood leaning upon him.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:284;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft3933">63.&nbsp;Herein, this is how it should be regarded. The space from which the kasiṇa<br>has been removed is like the tent in the dirty place. The [consciousness of the]<br>base consisting of boundless space, which makes space its object owing to<br>disgust with the sign of the fine-material, is like the man who hangs on to the<br>tent owing to disgust with the dirt. The [consciousness of the] base consisting of<br>boundless consciousness, the occurrence of which is contingent upon [the<br>consciousness of] the base consisting of boundless space whose object is space,<br>is like the man who leans upon the man who hangs on to the tent. The<br>[consciousness of the] base consisting of nothingness, which instead of making<br>[the consciousness of the] base consisting of boundless space its object has the<br>non-existence of that as its object, is like the man who,&nbsp;after considering the<br>insecurity of those two,&nbsp;does not lean upon the one hanging on to the tent, but<br>stands outside. The [consciousness of the] base consisting of neither perception<br>nor non-perception, the occurrence of which is contingent upon [the<br>consciousness of] the base consisting of nothingness, which stands in a place<br>outside, in other words, in the non-existence of [the past] consciousness, is like<br>the man who stands leaning upon the last-named, having considered the<br>insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one leaning upon him, and<br>fancying that the one standing outside is well placed.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:619;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft3930">64.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:619;left:108"><nobr><span class="ft3933">And while occurring in this way:<br>It takes this for its object since<br>There is no other one as good,<br>As men depend upon a king,<br>Whose fault they see, for livelihood.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:711;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft3930">65.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:711;left:34"><nobr><span class="ft3930">For although this [consciousness of the] base consisting of neither</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:728;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft3933">perception nor non-perception has seen the flaw in the base consisting of<br>nothingness in this way,&nbsp;“This attainment has the base consisting of boundless<br>consciousness as its near enemy,” notwithstanding that fact it takes it as its<br>object in the absence of any other. Like what? As men for the sake of livelihood<br>depend on kings whose faults they see. For just as, for the sake&nbsp;of livelihood and<br>because they cannot get a livelihood elsewhere, people put up with some king,<br>ruler of all quarters, who is unrestrained, and harsh in bodily, verbal, and mental<br>behaviour, though they see his faults thus, “He is harshly behaved,” so too the<br>[consciousness of the] base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception</span></nobr></DIV>
