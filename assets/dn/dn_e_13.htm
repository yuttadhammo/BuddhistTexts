Tevijja Sutta: The Threefold Knowledge - The Way to Brahma</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[235] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a
large company of some five hundred monks. He came to a Kosalan
Brahmin village called Manasakata, and stayed to the north of the
village in a mango-grove on the bank of the River Aciravati.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. And at that time many very well-known and prosperous Brahmins were
staying at Manasakata, including Canki, Tarukkha, Pokkharasati,
Janussoni, and Todeyya.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. And Vasettha and Bharadvaja went strolling along the road, and as
they did so, an argument broke out between them on the subject of
right and wrong paths.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. The young Brahmin Vasettha said: 'This is the only straight path,
this is the direct path, the path of salvation that leads one who
follows it to union with Brahma, as is taught by the Brahmin
Pokkharasati!'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote239anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote239sym"><SUP>239</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. And the young Brahmin Bharadvaja said: 'This is the only straight
path... [236] as taught by the Brahmin Tarukkha!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. And Vasettha could not convince Bharadvaja, nor could Bharadvaja
convince Vasettha.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. Then Vasettha said to Bharadvaja: 'This ascetic Gotama is staying
to the north of the village, and concerning this Blessed Lord a good
report has been spread about... (as Sutta 4, verse 2). Let us go to
the ascetic Gotama and ask him, and whatever he tells us, we shall
accept.' And Bharadvaja agreed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. So the two of them went to see the Lord. Having exchanged
courtesies with him, they sat down to one side, and Vasettha said:
'Reverend Gotama, as we were strolling along the road, we got to
discussing right and wrong paths. I said: &quot;This is the only
straight path... as is taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasati&quot;, and
Bharadvaja said: &quot;This is the only straight path... as is taught
by the Brahmin Tarukkha.&quot; This is our dispute, our quarrel, our
difference.' [237]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9. 'So, Vasettha, you say that the way to union with Brahma is that
taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasati, and Bharadvaja says it is that
taught by the Brahmin Tarukha. What is the dispute, the quarrel, the
difference all about?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
10. 'Right and wrong paths, Reverend Gotama. There are so many kinds
of Brahmins who teach different paths: the Addhariya, the Tittiriya,
the Chandoka, the Chandava, the Brahmacariya<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote240anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote240sym"><SUP>240</SUP></A></SUP>
Brahmins - do all these ways lead to union with Brahma? Just as if
there were near a town or village many different paths - do all these
come together at that place? And likewise, do the ways of the various
Brahmins ...lead the one who follows them to union with Brahma?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
11. 'You say: &quot;They lead&quot;, Vasettha?' 'I say: &quot;They

12. 'But, Vasettha, is there then a single one of these Brahmins
learned in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahma face to face?' 'No,
Reverend Gotama.'</P>

13. 'Well then, Vasettha, what about the early sages of those
Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, the makers of the mantras, the
expounders of the mantras, whose ancient verses are chanted,
pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today, and sung and
spoken about - such as Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta,

'No, Reverend Gotama.'</P>

teachers, or teacher's teachers, [239] nor even the ancestor seven
generations back of one of their teachers. Nor could any of the early
sages say: &quot;We know and see when, how and where Brahma appears.&quot;
So what these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are saying is: &quot;We
teach this path to union with Brahma that we do not know or see, this
is the only straight path.. leading to union with Brahma.&quot; What
do you think, Vasettha? Such being the case, does not what these

15. 'Well, Vasettha, when these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas

- so it is with the talk of these Brahmins learned in the Three
