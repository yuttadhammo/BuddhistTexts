[99] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was styaing at Nalanda in
Pavarika's mango-grove. And the Venerable Sariputta came to see the
Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said:<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote846anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote846sym"><SUP>846</SUP></A></SUP>
'It is clear to me, Lord, that there never has been, never will be
and is not now another ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more
enlightened than the Lord.'</P>

'You have spoken boldly with a bull's voice, Sariputta, you have
roared the lion's roar of certainty. How is this? Have all the
Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you, and were the minds of
all those Lords open to you, so as to say: &quot;These Lords were of
such virtue, such was their teaching, [ioo] such their wisdom, such
their way, such their liberation&quot;?' 'No, Lord.' 'And have you
perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the future?'
'No, Lord.' 'Well then, Sariputta, you know me as the Arahant Buddha,
and do you know: &quot;The Lord is of such virtue, such his teaching,
such his wisdom, such his way, such his liberation&quot;?' 'No,
Lord.' 'So, Sariputta, you do not have knowledge of the minds of the
Buddhas of the past, the future or the present. Then, Sariputta,have
you not spoken boldly with a bull's voice and roared the lion's roar
of certainty with your declaration?'</P>

2. 'Lord, the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past, future and
present are not open to me. But I know the drift of the Dhamma. Lord,
it is as if there were a [loi] royal frontier city, with mighty
bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate, at
which was a gatekeeper, wise, skilled and clever, who kept out
strangers and let in those he knew. And he, constantly patrolling and
following along a path, might not see the joins and clefts in the
bastion, even such as a cat might creep through. But whatever larger
creatures entered or left the city, must all go through this very
gate. And it seems to me, Lord, that the drift of the Dhamma is the
same. All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme
enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, defilements of mind
which weaken understanding, having firmly established the four
foundations of mindfulness in their minds, and realised the seven
factors of enlightenment as they really are. All the Arahant Buddhas
of the future will do likewise, and you, Lord, who are now the
Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, have done the same.</P>

'Well then, Udayi, just observe: so it is. If such wanderers were

21. Then the Lord said to Sariputta: 'And therefore you, Sariputta,
should frequently speak about this matter to monks and nuns, to male

their doubts and queries resolved.'</P>
