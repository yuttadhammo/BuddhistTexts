Janavasabha Sutta: About Janavasabha - Brahma Addresses the Gods</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[200] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Nadika at
the Brick House.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote487anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote487sym"><SUP>487</SUP></A></SUP>
And at that time the Lord was explaining the rebirths of various
devotees up and down the country who had died and passed away: Kasis
and Kosalans, Vajjians and Mallas, Cetis and Vamsas, Kurus and
Pancalas, Macchas and Surasenas, saying: 'This one was reborn there,
and that one there.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote488anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote488sym"><SUP>488</SUP></A></SUP>
More than fifty Nadikan devotees, having abandoned the five lower
fetters, were reborn spontaneously and would attain Nibbana without
returning to this world; over ninety of them, having abandoned three
fetters and weakened greed, hatred and delusion, were Once-Returners,
who would return to this world once more and then make an end of
suffering; and more than five hundred, having abandoned three
fetters, were Stream-Winners, incapable of falling into states of
woe, certain of Nibbana. [201]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. This news reached the ears of the devotees in Nadika, and they
were pleased, delighted and filled with joy to hear the Lord's
replies.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. And the Venerable Ananda heard of the Lord's report<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote489anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote489sym"><SUP>489</SUP></A></SUP>
and the Nadikans' delight.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. And he thought: [202] 'There were also Magadhan disciples of long
standing who have died and passed away. One would think Anga and
Magadha contained no Magadhan disciples who had died. Yet they too
were devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and they
observed the discipline perfectly. The Lord has not stated their
destiny. It would be good to have a declaration about this: it would
make the multitude have faith and so attain a good rebirth.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Now King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha was a righteous and lawful
king, a friend of Brahmins, householders, town and country-dwellers,
so that his fame is spread abroad: &quot;That righteous king of ours
is dead<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote490anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote490sym"><SUP>490</SUP></A></SUP>
who gave us so much happiness. Life was easy for us who dwelt under
his righteous rule.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote491anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote491sym"><SUP>491</SUP></A></SUP>
And he was devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and
observed the discipline perfectly. Thus people say: &quot;King
Bimbisara, who praised the Lord to his dying day, is dead!&quot; The
Lord has not declared his destiny, and it would be good to have a
declaration. . Besides, it was in Magadha that the Lord gained his
enlightenment. Since the Lord gained his enlightenment in Magadha,
why does he not declare the destinies of those who have died there?
For the Lord not to make such a declaration would cause unhappiness
to the Magadhans. [203] Such being the case, why does not the Lord
make such a declaration?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. And after thus reflecting in solitude on behalf of the Magadhan
devotees, the Venerable Ananda rose at the crack of dawn, went to the
Lord and saluted him. Then, sitting down to one side, he said: 'Lord,
I have heard what has been declared concerning the inhabitants of
Nadika.' (as verse 1-2)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. 'These were all devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha,
and they observed the discipline perfectly. The Lord has not stated
their destiny... (as verse 4). [204] Why does not the Lord make such
a declaration?' Then, having thus spoken to the Lord on behalf of the
Magadhan devotees, he rose from his seat, saluted the Lord, passed
him by to the right, and departed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. As soon as Ananda had gone, the Lord took his robe and bowl and
went into Nadika for alms. Later, on his return, after his meal, he
went to the Brick House and, having washed his feet, he went in and,
having thought over, considered and given his whole mind to the
question of the Magadhan devotees, he sat down on the prepared seat,
saying: 'I shall know their destiny and future lot, whatever it is.â€™<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote492anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote492sym"><SUP>492</SUP></A></SUP>
And then he perceived the destiny and fate of [205] each one of them.
And in the evening, emerging from meditative seclusion, the Lord came
out of the Brick House and sat down on the prepared seat in the shade
of his lodging.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. Then the Venerable Ananda came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down
to one side and said: 'Lord, the Lord's countenance looks bright and
shining, showing that the Lord's mind is at ease. Has the Lord been
satisfied with today's lodging?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9. 'Ananda, after you spoke to me about the devotees of Magadha, I
took my robe and bowl and went into Nadika for alms. Later on ...I
went to the Brick House and considered the question of the Magadhan
devotees... And I perceived the destiny and fate of each one of them.
Then the voice of a yakkha<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote493anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote493sym"><SUP>493</SUP></A></SUP>
who had passed over cried out: &quot;I am Janavasabha, Lord! I am
Janavasabha, Well-Farer!&quot; Well, Ananda, do you know anyone who
formerly bore the name of Janavasabha?' 'I must admit, Lord, that I
have never heard such a name; and yet, on hearing the name
&quot;Janavasabha&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote494anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote494sym"><SUP>494</SUP></A></SUP>
my hairs stood on end, and I thought: &quot;He [206] whose name is
janavasabha will not be such a low-ranking yakkha!&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
l0. 'Ananda, immediately after I heard this voice, the yakkha
appeared before me as a noble vision, and uttered a second cry: &quot;I
am Bimbisara, Lord! I am Bimbisara, Well-Farer! I have now for the
seventh time been reborn into the entourage of the Lord Vessavana.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote495anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote495sym"><SUP>495</SUP></A></SUP>
Thus having passed away as a king of humans, I have now become among
the devas a king of nonhuman beings.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Seven states here and seven there, fourteen births, <BR>That's the
tally of lives I can recall.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
For a long time, Lord, I have known myself to be exempt from states
of woe,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote496anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote496sym"><SUP>496</SUP></A></SUP>
and now the desire arises in me to become a Once-Returner.&quot; I
said: &quot;It is amazing, it is astonishing that the reverend yakkha
Janavasabha should say this. On what grounds can he know of such an
august specific attainment?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
11. &quot;'Not otherwise, Lord, not otherwise, Well-Farer, than
through your teaching! From the time when I became fully committed
and gained complete faith, from then on, Lord, for a long time [207]
I have known myself to be exempt from states of woe, and the desire
has arisen in me to become a OnceReturner. And here, Lord, having
been sent by King Vessavana on some business to King Virulhaka,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote497anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote497sym"><SUP>497</SUP></A></SUP>
I saw the Lord entering the Brick House and sitting down and
considering</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
the question of the Magadhan devotees ... And since I had only just
heard King Vessavana announce to his assembly what those folk's fates
were, it is no wonder that I thought: 'I will go and see the Lord and
report this to him.' And these, Lord, are the two reasons<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote498anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote498sym"><SUP>498</SUP></A></SUP>
why I came to see the Lord.&quot; (Janavasabha continued:)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
12. &quot;'Lord, in earlier days, long ago, on the fast-day of the
fifteenth at the beginning of the Rains,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote499anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote499sym"><SUP>499</SUP></A></SUP>
in the full-moon night all the Thirty-Three Gods were seated in the
Sudhamma Hall<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote500anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote500sym"><SUP>500</SUP></A></SUP>
- a great congregation of divine beings, and the Four Great Kings
from the four quarters were there. There was the Great King
Dhatarattha<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote501anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote501sym"><SUP>501</SUP></A></SUP>
from the east at the head of his followers, facing west; the Great
King Virulhaka from the south ... facing north; the Great King
Virupakkha from the west ... facing east; and the Great King
Vessavana from the north ... facing south. [208]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'On such occasions that is the order in which they are seated,
and after that came our seats. And those devas who, having lived the
holy life under the Lord, had recently appeared in the Heaven of the
Thirty-Three, outshone the other devas in brightness and glory. And
for that reason the ThirtyThree Gods were pleased, happy, filled with
delight and joy, saying: 'The devas' hosts are growing, the asuras'
hosts are declining!'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote502anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote502sym"><SUP>502</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
13. &quot;'Then, Lord, Sakka, ruler of the gods, seeing the
satisfaction of the Thirty-Three, uttered these verses of rejoicing:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'The gods of Thirty-Three rejoice, their leader too, <BR>Praising the
Tathagata, and Dhamma's truth, <BR>Seeing new-come devas, fair and
glorious <BR>Who've lived the holy life, now well reborn. <BR>Outshining
all the rest in fame and splendour, <BR>The mighty Sage's pupils
singled out.<BR>Seeing this, the Thirty-Three rejoice, their leader
too, <BR>Praising the Tathagata, and Dhamma's truth.' [209]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
At this the Thirty-Three Gods rejoiced still more, saying: 'The
devas' hosts are growing, the asuras' hosts are declining!' 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
14. &quot;'And then they consulted and deliberated together about the
matter concerning which they had assembled in the Sudhamma Hall, and
the Four Great Kings were advised and admonished on this matter as
they stood by their seats unmoving.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote503anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote503sym"><SUP>503</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
The Kings, instructed, marked the words they spoke, <BR>Standing
calm, serene, beside their seats.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
15. &quot;'And then, Lord, a glorious radiance shone forth from the
north, and a splendour was seen greater than the sheen of the devas.
And Sakka said to the Thirty-Three Gods: 'Gentlemen, when such signs
are seen, such light is seen and such radiance shines forth, Brahma
will appear.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote504anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote504sym"><SUP>504</SUP></A></SUP>
The appearance of such radiance is the first sign of Brahma's
approaching manifestation.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
When they see these signs, Brahma will soon appear: <BR>This is
Brahma s sign, radiance vast and great.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
16. &quot;'Then the Thirty-Three Gods sat down each in his proper
place, saying: 'Let us find out what comes<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote505anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote505sym"><SUP>505</SUP></A></SUP>
of this radiance, and having found the truth of it, we will go
towards it.' The Four Great Kings, sitting down in their places, said
[210] the same. Thus they were all agreed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
17. &quot;'Lord, whenever Brahma Sanankumara<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote506anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote506sym"><SUP>506</SUP></A></SUP>
appears to the Thirty-Three Gods, he appears having assumed a grosser
form, because his natural appearance is not such as to be perceptible
to their eyes.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote507anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote507sym"><SUP>507</SUP></A></SUP>
When he appears to the ThirtyThree Gods, he outshines other devas in
radiance and glory, just as a figure made of gold outshines the human
figure. And, Lord, when Brahma Sanankumara appears to the ThirtyThree
Gods, not one of them salutes him, or rises, or offers him a seat.
They all sit silently with palms together,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote508anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote508sym"><SUP>508</SUP></A></SUP>
crosslegged,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote509anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote509sym"><SUP>509</SUP></A></SUP>
thinking he will sit down on the couch<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote510anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote510sym"><SUP>510</SUP></A></SUP>
of that god from whom he wants something. And the one on whose couch
he sits down is as thrilled and delighted as a dulyanointed Khattiya
king on assuming his royal office. [211]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
18. &quot;'Then, Lord, Brahma Sanankumara, having assumed a grosser
form, appeared to the Thirty-Three Gods in the shape of the youth
Pancasikha.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote511anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote511sym"><SUP>511</SUP></A></SUP>
Rising up in the air, he appeared floating cross-legged, just as a
strong man might sit down on a properly-spread couch or on the
ground. And seeing the delight of the Thirty-Three Gods, he uttered
these verses of rejoicing:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'The gods of Thirty-Three rejoice, their leader too, <BR>Praising the

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
19. &quot;'Now to the matter of Brahma Sanankumara's speech, and as
for the manner of his speech, his voice had eight qualities: it was
distinct, intelligible, pleasant, attractive, compact, concise, deep
and resonant. And when he spoke in that voice to the assembly, its
sound did not carry outside. Whoever has such a voice as that is said
to have the voice of Brahma.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
20. &quot;'And Brahma Sanankumara, multiplying his shape by
thirty-three, [212] sat down cross-legged on each individual couch of
the Thirty-Three, and said: 'What do my lords the Thirty-Three think?
Since the Lord, out of compassion for the world and for the benefit
and happiness of the many, has acted to the advantage of devas and
mankind, those, whoever they may be, who have taken refuge in the
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha and have observed the moral
precepts<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote512anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote512sym"><SUP>512</SUP></A></SUP>
have, at death and the breaking-up of the body, arisen in the company
of the Parinimmita-Vasavatti devas,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote513anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote513sym"><SUP>513</SUP></A></SUP>
or the Nimmanaratti devas, or the Tusita devas, or the Yama devas, or
in the retinue of the Thirty-Three Gods, or of the Four Great Kings -
or at the very least in the company of the gandhabbas.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote514anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote514sym"><SUP>514</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
21. &quot;'This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumara's speech. And
every one of the gods he spoke to thought: 'He is sitting on my
couch, he is speaking to me alone.'</P>

All the forms assumed with one voice speak, <BR>And having spoken,
all at once are silent.<BR>And so the Thirty-Three, their leader too,
<BR>Each thinks: 'He speaks to me alone.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
22. &quot;'Then Brahma Sanankumara assumed a single form;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote515anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote515sym"><SUP>515</SUP></A></SUP>
then he sat down on [213] the couch of Sakka and said: 'What do my
lords the Thirty-Three think? This Lord, the Arahant supreme Buddha
has known and seen the four roads to power,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote516anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote516sym"><SUP>516</SUP></A></SUP>
and how to develop, perfect and practise them. What four? Here a monk
develops concentration of intention accompanied by effort of will,
concentration of energy..., concentration of consciousness..., and
concentration of investigation accompanied by effort of will. These
are the four roads to power... And whatever ascetics or Brahmins have
in the past realised such powers in different ways, they have all
developed and strongly practised these four ways, and the same
applies to all who may in the future, or who do now realise such
powers. Do my lords the Thirty-Three observe such powers in me?'
'Yes, Brahma.' 'Well, I too have developed and strongly practised
[214] these four ways.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
23. &quot;'This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumara's speech. He
went on: 'What do my lords of the Thirty-Three think? There are three
gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who knows and sees. What
are they? In the first place someone dwells in association with
sense-desires, with unwholesome conditions. At some time he hears the
Ariyan Dhamma, he pays close attention and practises in conformity
with it. By so doing he comes to live dissociated from such
sense-desires and unwholesome conditions. As a result of this
dissociation, pleasant feeling<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote517anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote517sym"><SUP>517</SUP></A></SUP>
arises, and what is more, gladness.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote518anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote518sym"><SUP>518</SUP></A></SUP>

feeling he experiences gladness.</P>

24. &quot;&quot;In the second place there is someone in whom the
gross tendencies<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote519anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote519sym"><SUP>519</SUP></A></SUP>
of body, speech and thought are not allayed. At some time he hears
the Ariyan Dhamma,... and his gross tendencies of body, speech and
[215] thought are allayed. As a result of this allaying, pleasant
feeling arises, and what is more, gladness...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
25. &quot;&quot;In the third place there is someone who really does
not know what is right and what is wrong, what is blameworthy and
what is not, what is to be practised and what is not, what is base
and what is noble, and what is foul, fair or mixed in quality. At
some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma, he pays close attention and
practises in conformity with it. As a result, he comes to know in
reality what is right and wrong, what is blameworthy and what is not,
what is to be practised and what is not, what is base and what is
noble, and what is foul, fair or mixed in quality. In him who knows
and sees thus, ignorance is dispelled and knowledge arises. With the
waning of ignorance and the arising of knowledge, pleasant feeling
arises, and what is more, gladness. Just as pleasure might give birth
to rejoicing, so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladness. [216]
These are the three gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who
knows and sees.'</P>

If anyone truthfully declaring: &quot;Well-proclaimed by the Lord is
the Dhamma, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection,
leading onward, to be comprehended by the wise each one for himself&quot;,
were to say: &quot;Open are the doors of the Deathless!&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote525anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote525sym"><SUP>525</SUP></A></SUP>
he would be speaking in accordance with the highest truth. For
indeed, my lords, the Dhamma is well-proclaimed by the Lord, visible
here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be
comprehended by the wise, each one for him or herself, and, too, the
doors to the Deathless are open!</P>

&quot;&quot;Those who have unshakeable faith in the Buddha, the
Dhamma and the Sangha, and are endowed with the virtues pleasing to
the Noble Ones, [218] those beings who have arisen here on account of
their Dhamma-training, amounting to more than twenty-four hundred
Magadhan followers who have passed over, have by the destruction of

of woe and certain of enlightenment, and indeed there are

28. &quot;'This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumara's speech. And in
connection with this the Great King Vessavana reflected in his mind:
'It is marvellous, it is wonderful, that such a glorious Teacher
should arise, that there should be such a glorious proclamation of
Dhamma, and that such glorious paths to the sublime should be made
known!' Then Brahma Sanankumara, reading King Vessavana's mind, said
to him: 'What do you think, King Vessavana? There has been such a
glorious Teacher in the past, and such a proclamation, and such paths
made known, and there will be again in the future.&quot;&quot;</P>

29. Such was the burden of what Brahma Sanankumara proclaimed to the
Thirty-Three Gods. And the Great King Vessavana, [219] having heard
and received it in person, related it to his followers. And the
yakkha Janavasabha, having heard it himself, related it to the Lord.
And the Lord, having heard it himself and also come to know it by his
own superknowledge, related it to the Venerable Ananda, who in turn
related it to the monks and nuns, the male and female layfollowers.</P>
