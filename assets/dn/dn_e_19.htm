Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha, on Vultures' Peak. And when
the night was nearly over, Pancasikha of the gandhabbas,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote528anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote528sym"><SUP>528</SUP></A></SUP>
lighting up the entire Vultures' Peak with a splendid radiance,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote529anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote529sym"><SUP>529</SUP></A></SUP>
approached the Lord, saluted him, stood to one side and said: 'Lord,
I wish to report to you what I have personally seen and observed when
I was in the presence of the Thirty-Three Gods.' 'Tell me then,
Pancasikha', said the Lord.</P>

2.-3. 'Lord, in earlier days, long ago, on the fast-day of the
fifteenth at the end of the Rains the Thirty-Three Gods assembled and
rejoiced that the devas' hosts were growing, the asuras' hosts
declining (as Sutta 18, verse 12). [221] Then Sakka uttered the
verse:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;The gods of Thirty-Three rejoice, their leader too, <BR>Praising
the Tathagata, and Dhamma's truth, <BR>Seeing new-come devas, fair
and glorious <BR>Who've lived the holy life, now well reborn.
<BR>Outshining all the rest in fame and splendour, <BR>The mighty
Sage's pupils singled out.<BR>Seeing this, the Thirty-Three rejoice,
their leader too, <BR>Praising the Tathagata, and Dhamma's truth.&quot;
[222]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
At this, Lord, the Thirty-Three Gods rejoiced still more, saying:

4. [Pancasikha continued:] 'Then Sakka, seeing their satisfaction,
said to the Thirty-Three Gods: &quot;Would you like, gentlemen, to
hear eight truthful statements in praise of the Lord?&quot; and on
receiving their assent, he declared:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. &quot;'What do you think, my lords of the Thirty-Three? As regards
the way in which the Lord has striven for the welfare of the many,
for the happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for
the welfare and happiness of devas and humans - we can find no
teacher endowed with such qualities, whether we consider the past or

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. &quot;'The Lord has well explained what is right and what is
wrong, what [223] is blameworthy and what is blameless, what is to be

path leading to Nibbana,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote531anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote531sym"><SUP>531</SUP></A></SUP>

10. &quot;'The gifts given to the Lord are well-bestowed, his fame is
well established, so much so that, I think, the Khattiyas will
continue to be attached to him, yet the Lord takes his food-offering
without conceit. And we can find no teacher who does this... [224]
other than the Lord.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">

'And when Sakka had thus proclaimed these eight truthful statements

overjoyed and filled with delight and happiness at what they had
heard in the Lord's praise.</P>

13. 'Then certain gods exclaimed: &quot;Oh, if only four
fullyenlightened Buddhas were to arise in the world and teach Dhamma
just like the Blessed Lord! That would be for the benefit and
happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the
benefit and happiness of devas and humans!&quot; And some said:
&quot;Never mind four fully-enlightened Buddhas - three would
suffice!&quot; and others said: &quot;Never mind three - two would
suffice!&quot; [225]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
14. 'At this Sakka said: &quot;It is impossible, gentlemen, it cannot
happen that two fully-enlightened Buddhas should arise simultaneously

'Then the Thirty-Three Gods consulted and deliberated together about

the Lord, at which we also rejoice.&quot; Then Brahma said to Sakka:

And sitting thus cross-legged, he said to the Thirty-Three Gods: &quot;For
how long has the Blessed Lord been one of mighty wisdom?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
29. &quot;'Once upon a time there was a king called Disampati. His
chaplain<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote536anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote536sym"><SUP>536</SUP></A></SUP>
was a Brahmin called the Steward.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote537anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote537sym"><SUP>537</SUP></A></SUP>
The King's son was a youth called Renu, and the Steward's son was
called Jotipala. Prince Renu and Jotipala, together with six other
Khattiyas, formed a band of eight friends. [231] In the course of
time the Steward died, and King Disampati mourned him, saying: 'Alas,
at the very moment when we had entrusted all our responsibilities to
the Steward, and were abandoning ourselves to the pleasures of the
five senses, the Steward has passed away!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'Hearing this, Prince Renu said: 'Sire, do not mourn the
Steward's death overmuch! His son Jotipala<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote538anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote538sym"><SUP>538</SUP></A></SUP>
is cleverer than his father was and has a better eye for what is
advantageous. You should let Jotipala manage all the business you
entrusted to his father.' 'Is that so, my boy?' 'Yes, Sire.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
30. &quot;'Then the King called a man and said: 'Come here, my good
man, go to the youth Jotipala and say: &quot;May the Reverend
Jotipala be well! King Disampati sends for you, he would like to see
you.&quot;' 'Very good, Your Majesty', said the man, and delivered
the message. [232] On receiving the message, Jotipala said: 'Very
good, sir', and went to see the King. On entering the royal presence,
he exchanged courtesies with the King, then sat down to one side. The
King said: 'We wish the Reverend Jotipala to manage our affairs. Do
not refuse. I will install you in your father's place and consecrate<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote539anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote539sym"><SUP>539</SUP></A></SUP>
you as Steward.' 'Very good, Lord', replied Jotipala.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
31. &quot;'So King Disampati appointed Jotipala as steward in his
father's place. And once installed, Jotipala carried out the business
his father had carried out, not doing any business his father had not
done. He accomplished all the tasks his father had accomplished, and
no others. And people said: 'This Brahmin is truly a steward! Indeed
he is a great steward!' And that is how the young Brahmin Jotipala
came to be known as the Great Steward.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
32. &quot;'And one day the Great Steward went to the group of six
nobles and said: 'King Disampati is aged, decrepit, [233] stricken
with age. His life is near its end and he cannot last much longer.
Who can tell how long people will live? When King Disampati dies, the
king-makers<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote540anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote540sym"><SUP>540</SUP></A></SUP>
are bound to anoint Prince Renu as King. You should go, gentlemen, to
Prince Renu and say: &quot;We are the beloved, dear and favoured
friends of the Lord Renu, sharing his joys and his sorrows. Our Lord
King Disampati is aged... When he dies, the king-makers are bound to
anoint the Lord Renu as King. If the Lord Renu should gain the
kingship, let him share it with us.&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
33. Very good, sir', said the six nobles, and they went to Prince
Renu and spoke to him as the Great Steward had proposed. 'Well,
gentlemen, who, apart from myself, ought to prosper but you? If,
gentlemen, I gain the kingship, I will share it with you.' [234]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
34. &quot;'In due course King Disampati died, and the king-makers
anointed Prince Renu King in his place. And having been made King,
Renu abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five senses. Then the
Great Steward went to the six nobles and said: 'Gentlemen, now King
Disampati is dead the Lord Renu, who has been anointed in his place,
has abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five senses. Who knows
what will come of this? The sense-pleasures are intoxicating. You
should go to him and say: &quot;King Disampati is dead and the Lord
Renu has been anointed King. Do you remember your word, Lord?&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'They did so, and the King said: 'Gentlemen, I remember my
word. Who is there who can divide this mighty realm of earth, so
broad in the north and so [narrow] like the front of a cart<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote541anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote541sym"><SUP>541</SUP></A></SUP>
in the south, into seven equal parts?' 'Who indeed, Lord, if not the
Great Steward?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
35. &quot;'So King Renu sent a man to the Great Steward to say: 'My
lord, the King sends for you.' [235] The man went, and the Great
Steward came to the King, exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down
to one side. Then the King said: 'My Lord Steward, go and divide this
mighty realm of earth, so broad in the north and so narrow like the
front of a cart in the south, into seven equal parts.' 'Very good,
Sire', said the Great Steward, and he did so.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
36. &quot;'And King Renu's country was in the centre:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Dantapura to the Kalingas, Potaka to the Assakas, Mahissati to the

Mithila to the Videhas, Campa to the Angas goes, Benares to the Kasi,
thus did the Steward dispose. [236]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
The six nobles were delighted with their respective gains and at the
success of the plan: 'What we wanted, desired, aimed at and strove
for, we have got!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Sattabhu, Brahmadatta, Vessabhu and Bharata, Renu and two

<H3 LANG="" CLASS="western">[End of first recitation-section]</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
37. &quot;'Then the six nobles came to the Great Steward and said:
'Reverend Steward, just as you were a beloved, dear and faithful
friend to King Renu, so you have been to us. Please manage our
affairs for us! We trust you will not refuse.' So he administered the
realms of seven anointed kings,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote543anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote543sym"><SUP>543</SUP></A></SUP>
and he also taught the mantras to seven distinguished Brahmins and
seven hundred advanced pupils.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote544anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote544sym"><SUP>544</SUP></A></SUP>
[237]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
38. &quot;'In course of time good reports were spread about
concerning the Great Steward: 'The Great Steward can see Brahma with
his own eyes, talks with him face to face and consults with him!'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote545anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote545sym"><SUP>545</SUP></A></SUP>
And he thought: 'Now this good report is being spread about
concerning me, that I can see Brahma with my own eyes,... but it is
not true. However, I have heard it said by aged and respectable
Brahmins, the teachers of teachers, that anyone who withdraws into
meditation for the four months of the Rains, developing the
absorption on compassion, can see Brahma with his own eyes, talk with
him face to face and consult with him. Suppose I were to do this!‚Äô<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote546anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote546sym"><SUP>546</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
39. &quot;&quot;So the Great Steward went to King Renu and told him
of the report, and of his wish to go into retreat and develop the
absorption on compassion. 'And nobody is to come near me except to
bring me food.' 'Reverend Steward, do as you think fit.' [238]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
40. &quot;'The six nobles likewise replied: 'Reverend Steward, do as
you think fit.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
41. &quot;'He went to the seven Brahmins and the seven hundred pupils
and told them of his intentions, adding: 'So, gentlemen, you carry on
with reciting the mantras you have heard and learnt, and teach them
to each other.' 'Reverend Steward, do as you think fit', they
replied. [239]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
42. &quot;'Then he went to his forty equal-ranking wives, and they
said: 'Reverend Steward, do as you think fit.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
43. &quot;'So the Great Steward erected a new lodging to the east of
the city and withdrew there for the four months of the Rains,
developing the absorption on compassion, and nobody came near him
except to bring him food. But at the end of four months he felt
nothing but dissatisfaction and weariness as he thought: 'I heard it
said ... that anyone who withdraws into meditation for the four
months of the Rains, developing the absorption on compassion, can see
Brahma with his own eyes ... But I cannot see Brahma with my own
eyes, and cannot talk, discuss or consult with him!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
44. &quot;'Now Brahma Sanankumara read his thoughts and, [240] as
swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it
again, he disappeared from the Brahma world and appeared before the
Great Steward. And the Great Steward felt fear and trembling, and his
hair stood on end at such a sight as he had never seen before. And
thus fearful, trembling, with hair standing on end, he addressed
Brahma Sanankumara in these verses:</P>

This means that one renounces one's possessions, small or great,

goes forth from the household life into homelessness. This is how I
understand &quot;Spurning possessive thoughts&quot;. [242] I
understand &quot;Alone, intent&quot;. That means that one goes off on
one's own and chooses a lodging in the forest, at the foot of a tree,
in a mountain glen, in a rocky cave, a charnel-ground,</P>

in the jungle or on a heap of grass in the open ... I understand
&quot;Compassion-filled&quot;. That means that one dwells suffusing
one quarter with a mind filled with compassion, then a second, then a
third and a fourth quarter. Thus one abides suffusing the whole
world, up, down and across, everywhere, all around, with a mind
filled with compassion, expanded, immeasurable, free from hatred and
ill-will. That is how I understand &quot;Compassion-filled&quot;. But

48. &quot;'Then the Great Steward went to the six nobles and said to
them: 'My lords, please appoint another minister to manage your

together: 'These Brahmins are greedy for money. Perhaps we can win
the Great Steward round with money.' So they came back to him and
said: 'Sir, there is plenty of wealth in these seven kingdoms. Take
as much as you like.' 'Enough, gentlemen, I have received plenty of
wealth from my lords already. That is the very thing that I am

we too will go forth into homelessness. Wherever you go, we will

go forth into homelessness. Wherever you go, we will follow.' 'Seven
is not long, gentlemen. I agree, my lords, to seven days.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
56. &quot;'Then the Great Steward went to the seven Brahmins and
their seven hundred advanced pupils, and said to them: 'Now, Your
Reverences, you must seek another teacher to teach you the mantras. I
mean to go forth from the household life into homelessness. After
what Brahma has told me about the stench of the world, which cannot
be easily overcome by one living the household life, I am going forth
into homelessness.' 'Reverend Steward, do not do so! There is little
power and profit in the homeless life, and much power and profit in
the life of a Brahmin!'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote553anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote553sym"><SUP>553</SUP></A></SUP>
'Do not say such things, gentlemen!</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Besides, who has greater power and profit than I have? I have been
like a king to kings, like Brahma to the Brahmins, like a deity to
householders, and I am giving all this up in order to go forth from
the household life into homelessness, as I have [249] explained.' 'If
the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into
homelessness, we will do likewise. Wherever you go, we will follow.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
57. &quot;'Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and
said: 'Whichever of you ladies wishes to may go back to her own
family and seek another husband. I mean to go forth into
homelessness...' 'You alone are the kinsman we could wish for, the
only husband we want. If the Reverend Steward goes forth into
homelessness, we will do likewise. Wherever you go, we will follow.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
58. &quot;'And so the Great Steward, at the end of the seven days,
shaved off his hair and beard, donned yellow robes and went forth
from the household life into homelessness. And with him went the
seven anointed Khattiya kings, the seven wealthy and distinguished
Brahmins with their seven hundred advanced pupils, his forty equal
wives, several thousand Khattiyas, several thousand Brahmins, several
thousand householders, even some harem-women.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'And so, followed by this company, the Great Steward wandered
through villages, towns and royal [250] cities. And whenever he came
to a village or town, he was like a king to kings, like Brahma to the
Brahmins, like a deity to householders. And in those days, whenever
anyone sneezed or stumbled, they used to say: 'Praise be to the Great
Steward! Praise be to the Minister of Seven!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
59. &quot;&quot;And the Great Steward dwelt suffusing one quarter
with a mind filled with loving-kindness, then a second, then a third
and a fourth quarter. He dwelt suffusing the whole world, up, down
and across, everywhere, all around, with a mind filled with
compassion,... with a mind filled with sympathetic joy,... with a
mind filled with equanimity,... free from hatred and ill-will. And
thus he taught his disciples the way to union with the Brahma-world.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
60. &quot;'And all those who had at that time been the Great
Steward's pupils and had fully mastered his teaching, were after
death at the breaking-up of the body reborn in a happy sphere, in the
Brahma-world. And those who had not fully mastered his teaching were
reborn either among the Paranimmita-Vasavatti devas, among the
Nimmanarati devas, among the Tusita devas, among the Yama devas,
[251] among the devas of the Thirty-Three Gods, or among the devas of
the Four Great Kings. And the very lowest realm that any of them
attained was that of the gandhabbas. Thus the going-forth of all
those people was not fruitless or barren, but productive of fruit and
profit.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
61. 'Do you remember this, Lord?&quot;I do, Pancasikha. At that time
I was the Brahmin, the Great Steward, and I taught those disciples
the path to union with the Brahma-world.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'However, Pancasikha, that holy life does not lead to disenchantment,
to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to superknowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana, but only to birth in the Brahma-world,
whereas my holy life leads unfailingly to disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to superknowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana. That is the Noble Eightfold Path, namely
Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right
Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
62. 'And, Pancasikha, those of my disciples who have fully mastered
my teaching have by their own super-knowledge realised, [252] by the
destruction of the corruptions in this very life, the uncorrupted
freedom of heart and mind. And of those who have not fully mastered
it, some by the destruction of the five lower fetters will be reborn
spontaneously, attaining thence to Nibbana without returning to this
world; some by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of
greed, hatred and delusion will become Once-Returners, who will
return once more to this world before making an end of suffering; and
some by the destruction of three fetters will become Stream-Winners,
incapable of falling into states of woe, assured of enlightenment.
Thus the going-forth of all these people was not fruitless or barren,
but productive of fruit and profit.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Thus the Lord spoke, and Pancasikha of the gandhabbas was delighted
and rejoiced at the Lord's words. And, having saluted him, he passed
him by on the right and vanished from the spot.</P>
