Ambattha Sutta: About Ambattha - Pride Humbled</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[87] 1.1 THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a
large number of monks, some five hundred, and he came to a Kosalan
Brahmin village called Icchanankala. And he stayed in the dense
jungle of Icchanankala. At that time the Brahmin Pokkharasati was
living at Ukkhattha, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water
and corn, which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a
royal gift and with royal powers.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote131anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote131sym"><SUP>131</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.2. And Pokkharasati heard say: 'The ascetic Gotama, son of the
Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan,... is staying in the
dense jungle of Icchanankala. And concerning that Blessed Lord a good
report has been spread about: &quot;This Blessed Lord is an Arahant,
a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a
Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be
tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.&quot; He
proclaims this world with its gods, maras, Brahmns, the world of
ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to
know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in
its beginning, lovely in its middle, and lovely in its ending, in the
spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected,
thoroughly purified [88] holy life. And indeed it is good to see such
Arahants.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.3. Now at that time Pokkharasati had a pupil, the youth Ambattha,
who was a student of the Vedas, who knew the mantras, perfected in
the Three Vedas, a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals, the
lore of sounds and meanings and, fifthly, oral tradition, complete in
philosophy<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote132anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote132sym"><SUP>132</SUP></A></SUP>
and in the marks<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote133anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote133sym"><SUP>133</SUP></A></SUP>
of a Great Man, admitted and accepted by his master in the Three
Vedas with the words: 'What I know, you know; what you know, I know.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.4. And Pokkharasati said to Ambattha: 'Ambattha, my son, the
ascetic Gotama...is staying in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. And
concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about ...
Now you go to see the ascetic Gotama and find out whether this report
is correct or not, and whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or
not. In that way we shall put the Reverend Gotama to the test.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.5. 'Sir, how shall I find out whether the report is true, or
whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not?' 'According to the
tradition of our mantras, Ambattha, the great man who is possessed of
the thirty-two marks of a Great Man has only two courses open to him.
If he lives the household life he will become a ruler, a
wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote134anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote134sym"><SUP>134</SUP></A></SUP>
conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of
his realm and is possessed of the [89] seven treasures.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote135anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote135sym"><SUP>135</SUP></A></SUP>
These are: the Wheel-Treasure, the ElephantTreasure, the
Horse-Treasure, the Jewel-Treasure, the WomanTreasure, the
Householder-Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor-Treasure. He
has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature,
conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered this
sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law. But if he goes
forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become
an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, one who draws back the veil
from the world.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote136anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote136sym"><SUP>136</SUP></A></SUP>
And, Ambattha, I am the passer-on of the mantras, and you are the
receiver.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.6. 'Very good, sir', said Ambattha at Pokkharasati's words, and he
got up, passed by Pokkharasati with his right side, got into his
chariot drawn by a mare and, accompanied by a number of young men,
headed for the dense jungle of Icchanankala. He drove as far as the
carriage would go, then alighted and continued on foot.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.7. At that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the
open air. Ambattha approached them and said: 'Where is the Reverend
Gotama to be found just now? We have come to see the Reverend
Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.8. The monks thought: 'This is Ambattha, a youth of good family and
a pupil of the distinguished Brahmin Pokkharasati. The Lord would not
mind having a conversation with such a young man.' And they said to
Ambattha: 'That is his dwelling, with the door closed. Go quietly up
to it, go on to the verandah without haste, cough, and knock on the
bolt. The Lord will open the door to you.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.9. Ambattha went up to the dwelling and on to the verandah,
coughed, and knocked. The Lord opened the door, and Ambattha went in.
The young men entered, exchanged courtesies with the Lord, and sat
down to one side. But Ambattha walked up and down while the Lord sat
there, [90] uttered some vague words of politeness, and then stood so
speaking before the seated Lord.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.10. And the Lord said to Ambattha: 'Well now, Ambattha, would you
behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned
Brahmins, teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and
standing while I am sitting, and uttering vague words of politeness?'
'No, Reverend Gotama. A Brahmin should walk with a walking Brahmin,
stand with a standing Brahmin, sit with a sitting Brahmin, and lie
down with a Brahmin who is lying down. But as for those shaven little
ascetics, menials, black scourings from Brahma s foot, with them it
is fitting to speak just as I do with the Reverend Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.11. 'But, Ambattha, you came here seeking something. Whatever it
was you came for, you should listen attentively to hear about it.
Ambattha, you have not perfected your training. Your conceit of being
trained is due to nothing but inexperience.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.12. But Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called
untrained, and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults.
Thinking: 'The ascetic Gotama bears me ill-will', he said: 'Reverend
Gotama, the Sakyans are fierce, rough-spoken, touchy [91] and
violent. Being of menial origin, being menials, they do not honour,
respect, esteem, revere or pay homage to Brahmins. With regard to
this it is not proper... that they do not pay homage to Brahmins.'
This was the first time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being
menials.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.13. 'But, Ambattha, what have the Sakyans done to you?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Reverend Gotama, once I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my
teacher, the Brahmin Pokkharasati, and I came to the Sakyans'
meeting-hall. And at that time a lot of Sakyans were sitting on high
seats in their meeting-hall, poking each other with their fingers,
laughing and playing about together, and it seemed to me that they
were just making fun of me, and no one offered me a seat. With regard
to this, it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the
Brahmins.' This was the second time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of
being menials.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.14. 'But Ambattha, even the quail, that little bird, can talk as
she likes on her own nest. Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans' home,
Ambattha. They do not deserve censure for such a trifle.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Reverend Gotama, there are four castes:<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote137anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote137sym"><SUP>137</SUP></A></SUP>
the Khattiyas, the Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans. And of
these four castes three - the Khattiyas, the merchants and the
artisans - are entirely subservient to the Brahmins. With regard to
this, [92] it is not proper that they should not pay homage to the
Brahmins.' This was the third time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of
being menials.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.15. Then the Lord thought: 'This young man goes too far in abusing
the Sakyans. Suppose I were to ask after his clanname?' So he said:
'Ambattha, what is your clan?' 'I am a Kanhayan, Reverend Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Ambattha, in former days, according to those who remember the
ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are
descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans. For the Sakyans regard
King Okkaka as their ancestor. At one time King Okkaka, to whom his
queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her
son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom - Okkamukha,
Karandu, Hatthiniya and Sinipura. And these, being banished, made
their home on the flank of the Himalayas beside a lotus-pond where
there was a big grove of teak-trees.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote138anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote138sym"><SUP>138</SUP></A></SUP>
And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own
sisters. Then King Okkaka asked his ministers and counsellors: &quot;Where
are the princes living now?&quot; and they told him. At this King
Okkaha exclaimed: [93] &quot;They are strong as teak (saka), these
princes, they are real Sakyans!&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote139anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote139sym"><SUP>139</SUP></A></SUP>
And that is how the Sakyans got their well-known name. And the King
was the ancestor of the Sakyans.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.16. 'Now King Okkaka had a slave-girl called Disa, who gave birth
to a black child. The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed: &quot;Wash
me, mother! Bath me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt, and I will
bring you profit!&quot; Because, Ambattha, just as people today use
the term hobgoblin (pisaca) as a term of abuse, so in those days they
said black (kanha). And they said: &quot;As soon as he was born, he
spoke. He is born a Kanha, a hobgoblin!&quot; That is how in former
days ... the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a
slavegirl of the Sakyans.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.17. On hearing this, the young men said: 'Reverend Gotama, do not
humiliate Ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a
slave-girl: Ambattha is well-born, of a good family, he is very
learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, well able to hold his own in
this discussion with the Reverend Gotama!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.18. Then the Lord said to the young men: 'If you consider that
Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, unlearned, [94]
ill-spoken, no scholar, unable to hold his own in this discussion
with the ascetic Gotama, then let Ambattha be silent, and you conduct
this discussion with me. But if you think he is... able to hold his
own, then you be quiet, and let him discuss with me.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.19. 'Ambattha is well-born, Reverend Gotama...We will be silent, he
shall continue.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.20. Then the Lord said to Ambattha: 'Ambattha, I have a fundamental
question for you, which you will not like to answer. If you don't
answer, or evade the issue, if you keep silent or go away, your head
will split into seven pieces. What do you think, Ambattha? Have you
heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where
the Kanhayans came from, or who was their ancestor?' At this,
Ambattha remained silent. The Lord asked him a second time. [95]
Again Ambattha remained silent, and the Lord said: 'Answer me now,
Ambattha, this is not a time for silence. Whoever, Ambattha, does not
answer a fundamental question put to him by a Tathagata by the third
asking has his head split into seven pieces.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote140anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote140sym"><SUP>140</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.21. And at that moment Vajirapani the yakkha,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote141anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote141sym"><SUP>141</SUP></A></SUP>
holding a huge iron club, flaming, ablaze and glowing, up in the sky
just above Ambattha, was thinking: 'If this young man Ambattha does
not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the
third time of asking, I'll split his head into seven pieces!' The
Lord saw Vajirapani, and so did Ambattha. And at the sight, Ambattha
was terrified and unnerved, his hairs stood on end, and he sought
protection, shelter and safety from the Lord. Crouching down close to
the Lord, he said: 'What did the Reverend Gotama say? May the
Reverend Gotama repeat what he said!' 'What do you think, Ambattha?
Have you heard who was the ancestor of the Kanhayans?' 'Yes, I have
heard it just as the Reverend Gotama said, that is where the
Kanhayans came from, he was their ancestor.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.22. Hearing this, the young men made a loud noise and clamour: 'So
Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, born of a slave-girl of
the Sakyans, and the Sakyans are Ambattha's masters! We disparaged
the ascetic Gotama, thinking he was not speaking the truth!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.23. Then the Lord thought: 'It is too much, [96] the way these
young men humiliate Ambattha for being the son of a slave-girl. I
must get him out of this.' So he said to the young men: 'Don't
disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave-girl! That
Kanha was a mighty sage.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote142anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote142sym"><SUP>142</SUP></A></SUP>
He went to the south country,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote143anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote143sym"><SUP>143</SUP></A></SUP>
learnt the mantras of the Brahmins there, and then went to King
Okkaka and asked for his daughter Maddarupi. And King Okkaka,
furiously angry, exclaimed: &quot;So this fellow, the son of a
slave-girl, wants my daughter!&quot;, and put an arrow to his bow.
But he was unable either to shoot the arrow or to withdraw it.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote144anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote144sym"><SUP>144</SUP></A></SUP>
Then the ministers and counsellors came to the sage Kanha and said:
&quot;Spare the king, Reverend Sir, spare the king!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'The king will be safe, but if he looses the arrow downwards,
the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extends.&quot; &quot;'Reverend
Sir, spare the king, spare the land!&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'The king and the land will be safe, but if he looses the arrow
upwards, as far as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for
seven years.”<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote145anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote145sym"><SUP>145</SUP></A></SUP></P>

&quot;'Reverend Sir, spare the king and the land, and may the god let

&quot;'The king and the land will be safe, and the god will let it
rain, but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince, the
prince will be completely safe.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Then the ministers exclaimed: &quot;Let King Okkaka point the arrow
at the crown prince, the prince will be perfectly safe!&quot; The
king did so, and the prince was unharmed. Then King Okkaka, terrified
and fearful of divine punishment,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote146anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote146sym"><SUP>146</SUP></A></SUP>
[97] gave away his daughter Maddarupi. So, young men, do not
disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slavegirl. That
Kanha was a mighty sage.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.24. Then the Lord said: 'Ambattha, what do you think? Suppose a
Khattiya youth were to wed a Brahmin maiden, and there was a son of
the union. Would that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden
receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?' 'He would, Reverend

with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He
preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
displays the fullyperfected and purified holy life.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote147anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote147sym"><SUP>147</SUP></A></SUP>
A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities (Sutta 2, verse
41-62); he guards the sensedoors, etc. (Sutta 2, verse 64-75);
attains the four jhdnas (Sutta 2, verse 75-82). Thus he develops
conduct. He attains various insights (Sutta 2, verse 83-95), and the
cessation of the corruptions (Sutta 2, verse 97)... And beyond this
there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is
higher or more perfect.</P>

2.3. 'But, Ambattha, in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of
knowledge and conduct [101] there are four paths of failure.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote148anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote148sym"><SUP>148</SUP></A></SUP>
What are they? In the first place, an ascetic or Brahmin who has not
managed to gain<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote149anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote149sym"><SUP>149</SUP></A></SUP>
this unexcelled attainment, takes his carrying-pole<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote150anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote150sym"><SUP>150</SUP></A></SUP>
and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking: &quot;I will live
on windfalls.&quot; But in this way he only becomes an attendant on
one who has attained. This is the first path of failure. Again, an
ascetic or Brahmin ..., being unable to live on windfalls, takes a
spade and basket, thinking: &quot;I will live on tubers and
roots.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote151anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote151sym"><SUP>151</SUP></A></SUP>...
This is the second path of failure. Again, an ascetic or Brahmin,
being unable to live on tubers and roots, makes a fire-hearth at the
edge of a village or small town and sits tending the flame<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote152anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote152sym"><SUP>152</SUP></A></SUP>...
This is the third path of failure. Again, an ascetic or Brahmin,
being unable to tend the flame, [102] erects a house with four doors
at the crossroads thinking: &quot;Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives
from the four quarters, I will honour to the best of my strength and
ability.&quot; But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one
who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct. This is the
fourth path of failure.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.4. 'What do you think, Ambattha? Do you and your teacher live in
accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct?' 'No indeed,
Reverend Gotama! Who are my teacher and I in comparison? We are far
from it!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Well then, Ambattha, could you and your teacher, being unable to
gain this..., go with your carrying-poles into the depths of the
forest, intending to live on windfalls?' 'No indeed, Reverend
Gotama.'</P>

2.5. 'And so, Ambattha, not only are you and your teacher incapable
of attaining this unexcelled knowledge and conduct, but even the four
paths of failure are beyond you. And yet you and your teacher the
Brahmin Pokkharasati utter these words: &quot;These shaven little
ascetics, menials, black scrapings from Brahma's foot, what converse
can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas?&quot; - even
though you can't even manage the duties of one who has failed. See,
Ambattha, how your teacher has let you down!</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.6. 'Ambattha, the Brahmin Pokkharasati lives by the grace and
favour of King Pasenadi of Kosala. And yet the King does not allow
him to have audience face to face. When he confers with the King it
is through a curtain. Why should the King not grant audience face to
face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of
revenue? See how your teacher has let you down!</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.7. 'What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting
on the neck of an elephant or on horseback, or was standing on the
chariot-mat, conferring with his ministers and princes about
something. [104] And suppose he were to step aside and some workman
or workman's servant were to come along and stand in his place. And
standing there he might say: &quot;This is what King Pasenadi of
Kosala says!&quot; Would he be speaking the King's words, as if he
were the King's equal?' 'No indeed, Reverend Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.8. 'Well then, Ambattha, it is just the same thing. Those who were,
as you say, the first sages of the Brahmins, the makers and
expounders of the mantras, whose ancient verses are chanted,
pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today - Atthaka, Vamaka,
Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha,
Kassapa, Bhagu<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote153anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote153sym"><SUP>153</SUP></A></SUP>

sage - such a thing is not possible.</P>

2.9. 'What do you think, Ambattha? What have you heard said by
Brahmins who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Those
first sages..., Atthaka,... Bhagu - did they enjoy themselves,
well-bathed, perfumed, their hair and beards trimmed, adorned with
garlands and wreaths, dressed in white clothes, indulging in the
pleasures of the five senses and addicted to them, as you and your
teacher do now?' [105] 'No, Reverend Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.10. 'Or did they eat special fine rice with the black spots
removed, with various soups and curries, as you and your teacher do
now?' 'No, Reverend Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and
furbelows, as you and your teacher do now?' 'No, Reverend Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided
tails, that they urged on with long goad-sticks?' 'No, Reverend
Gotama.'</P>

'Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with

'So, Ambattha, neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained
in the way of a sage. And now, as for your doubts and perplexities
concerning me, we will clarify these by your asking me, and by my
answering your questions.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.11 Then, descending from his lodging, the Lord started to walk up
and down, and Ambattha did likewise. And as he walked along with the
Lord, Ambattha looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on
the Lord's body. And he could see all of them except [106] for two.
He was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks: he could not
make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the
large tongue.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.12. And the Lord, being aware of his doubts, effected by his
psychic power that Ambattha could see his sheathed genitals, and
then, sticking out his tongue, he reached out to lick both ears and
both nostrils, and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with
his tongue. Then Ambattha thought: 'The ascetic Gotama is equipped
with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none
missing.' Then he said to the Lord: 'Reverend Gotama, may I go now? I
have much business, much to do.' 'Ambattha, do what you now think
fit.' So Ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and
departed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.13. Meanwhile the Brahmin Pokkharasati had gone outside and was
sitting in his park with a large number of Brahmins, just waiting for
Ambattha. Then Ambattha came to the park. He rode in the chariot as
far as it would go, and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati
was, saluted him, and sat down to one side. Then Pokkharasati said:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.14. 'Well, dear boy, did you see the Reverend Gotama?' 'I did,
sir.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'And was the Reverend Gotama such [107] as he is reported to be, and
not otherwise? And is he of such nature, and not otherwise?' 'Sir, he
is as he is reported to be, and he is of such nature and not
otherwise. He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man,
all complete, with none missing.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'But was there any conversation between you and the ascetic Gotama?'
'There was, sir.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'And what was this conversation about?' So Ambattha told Pokkharasati
all that had passed between the Lord and himself.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.15. At this Pokkharasati exclaimed: 'Well, you're a fine little
scholar, a fine wise man, a fine expert in the Three Vedas! Anyone
going about his business like that ought when he dies, at the
breaking-up of the body, to go to the downfall, to the evil path, to
ruin, to hell! You have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama, as a
result of which he has brought up more and more things against us!
You're a fine little scholar ...!' He was so angry and enraged that
he kicked Ambattha over, and wanted to start out at once to see the
Lord. [108]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.16. But the Brahmins said: 'It is far too late, sir, to go to see
the ascetic Gotama today. The Reverend Pokkharasati should go to see
him tomorrow.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Then Pokkharasati, having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his
own home, set out by the light of torches from Ukkattha for the
jungle of Icchanankala. He went by chariot as far as possible, then
continued on foot to where the Lord was. Having exchanged courtesies
with the Lord, he sat down to one side and said:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.17. 'Venerable Gotama, did not our pupil Ambattha come to see you?'
'He did, Brahmin.' 'And was there any conversation between you?'
'There was.' 'And what was this conversation about?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Then the Lord told Pokkharasati all that had passed between him and
Ambattha. At this, Pokkharasati said to the Lord: 'Reverend Gotama,
Ambattha is a young fool. May the Reverend Gotama pardon him.'
'Brahmin, may Ambattha be happy.' [109]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.18-19. Then Pokkharasati looked out for the thirty-two marks of a
Great Man on the Lord's body and he could see all of them except for
two: the sheathed genitals and the large tongue; but the Lord set his
mind at rest about these (as verse 11-12). And Pokkharasati said to
the Lord: 'May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from me today
together with his order of monks!' And the Lord consented by silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.20. Seeing his acceptance, Pokkharasati said to the Lord: 'It is
time, Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready.' And the Lord, having
dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and howl,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote154anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote154sym"><SUP>154</SUP></A></SUP>
went with his order of monks to Pokkharasati's residence, and sat
down on the prepared seat. Then Pokkharasati personally served the
Lord with choice hard and soft food, and the young men served the
monks. And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl,
Pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stool.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.21 And as Pokkharasati sat there, [iio] the Lord delivered a
graduated discourse on generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing
the danger, degradation and corruption of sensedesires, and the
profit of renunciation. And when the Lord knew that Pokkharasati's
mind was ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm,
then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief: on suffering, its
origin, its cessation, and the path. And just as a clean cloth from
which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly, so in
the Brahmin Pokkharasati, as he sat there, there arose the pure and
spotless Dhamma-eye, and he knew: 'Whatever things have an origin
must come to cessation.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote155anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote155sym"><SUP>155</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.22. And Pokkharasati, having seen, attained, experienced and
penetrated the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended
uncertainty, having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher's
doctrine without relying on others, said: 'Excellent, Lord,
excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked
down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an
oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what
was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in
various ways ...I go with my son, my wife, my ministers and
counsellors for refuge to the Reverend Gotama, to the Dhamma and to
the Sangha.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote156anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote156sym"><SUP>156</SUP></A></SUP>
May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a layfollower who has taken
refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last! And whenever
the Reverend Gotama visits other families or lay-followers in
Ukkattha, may he also visit the family of Pokkharasati! Whatever
young men and maidens are there will revere the Reverend Gotama and
rise before him, will give him a seat and water and will be glad at
heart, and that will be for their welfare and happiness for a long
time.'</P>
