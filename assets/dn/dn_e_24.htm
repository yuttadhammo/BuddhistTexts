Patika Sutta: About Patikaputta - The Charlatan</H2>

Once the Lord was staying among the Mallas. Anupiya is the name of a
Malla town, and the Lord, having dressed in the early morning and
taken his robe and bowl, went to Anupiya for alms. Then he thought:
'It is too early for me to go into Anupiya for alms. Suppose I were
to visit the hermitage<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote723anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote723sym"><SUP>723</SUP></A></SUP>
of the wanderer Bhaggava-gotta?' And he did so. [2]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.2. And the wanderer Bhaggava-gotta said: 'Come, Blessed Lord,
welcome, Blessed Lord! At last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his
way to come here. Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.' The Lord sat
down on the prepared seat, and Bhaggava took a low stool and sat down
to one side. Then he said: 'Lord, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the
Licchavi<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote724anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote724sym"><SUP>724</SUP></A></SUP>
came to me and said: &quot;Bhaggava, I have left the Blessed Lord. I
am no longer under his rule.&quot; Is that really so, Lord?' 'It is
true, Bhaggava.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote725anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote725sym"><SUP>725</SUP></A></SUP></P>

1.3. 'A few days ago, Sunakkhatta came to me, saluted me, sat down to
one side, and said: &quot;Lord, I am leaving the Blessed Lord, I am
no longer under the Lord's rule.&quot; So I said to him: &quot;Well,
Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: 'Come, Sunakkhatta, be under my
rule'?&quot; &quot;No, Lord.&quot; [31 &quot;Or did you ever say to
me: 'Lord, I will be under your rule'?&quot; &quot;No, Lord.&quot;
&quot;So, Sunakkhatta, if I did not say that to you and you did not
say that to me - you foolish man, who are you and what are you giving
up? Consider, foolish man, how far the fault is yours.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.4. &quot;'Well, Lord, you have not performed any miracles.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote726anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote726sym"><SUP>726</SUP></A></SUP>
&quot;And did I ever say to you: 'Come under my rule, Sunakkhatta,
and I will perform miracles for you'?&quot; &quot;No, Lord.&quot; &quot;Or
did you ever say to me: 'Lord, I will be under your rule if you will
perform miracles for me'?&quot; &quot;No, Lord.&quot; &quot;Then it
appears, Sunakkhatta, that I made no such promises, and you made no
such conditions. Such being the case, you foolish man, who are you
and what are you giving up?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Whether miracles are

to the total destruction of suffering?&quot; [4] &quot;It is, Lord.&quot;
&quot;So, Sunakkhatta, whether miracles are performed or not, the
purpose of my teaching Dhamma is to lead whoever practises it to the
total destruction of suffering. Then what purpose would the
performance of miracles serve? Consider, you foolish man, how far the
fault is yours.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.5. &quot;'Well, Lord, you do not teach the beginning of things.&quot;

Lord.”... Such being the case, you foolish man, who are you and
what are you giving up? [5]</P>

1.6. &quot;'Sunakkhatta, you have in many ways spoken in praise of me
among the Vajjians, saying: 'This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a
fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, the
Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be
tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed Lord.' You
have in many ways spoken in praise of the Dhamma, saying:
'Well-proclaimed by the Blessed Lord is the Dhamma, visible here and
now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be realised by
the wise, each one for himself.' You have in many ways spoken in
praise of the order of monks, saying: 'Welltrained is the order of
the Lord's disciples, trained in uprightness, methodically-trained,
excellently-trained is the order of the Lord's disciples, that is,
the four pairs of men, the eight classes of individuals. This is the
order of the Lord's disciples, worthy of respect, worthy of homage,
worthy of gifts, worthy of salutation, an unsurpassed field in the
world for merit.'</P>

&quot;'In these ways you have spoken in praise of me, of the Dhamma,
and of the order among the Vajjians. And I say to you, I declare to
you, Sunakkhatta, there will be those who will say: 'Sunakkhatta the
Licchavi was unable to maintain the holy life under the ascetic
Gotama, and being thus unable he abandoned the training and reverted
to a base life.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote728anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote728sym"><SUP>728</SUP></A></SUP>
That, Sunakkhatta, is what they will say.&quot; [6] And, Bhaggava, at
my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one
condemned to hell.</P>

1.7. 'Once, Bhaggava, I was staying among the Khulus,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote729anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote729sym"><SUP>729</SUP></A></SUP>
at a place called Uttaraka, a town of theirs. In the early morning I
went with robe and bowl into Uttaraka for alms, with Sunakkhatta as
my attendant. And at that time the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya the
&quot;dog-man”<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote730anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote730sym"><SUP>730</SUP></A></SUP>
was going round on all fours, sprawling on the ground, and chewing
and eating his food with his mouth alone. Seeing him, Sunakkhatta
thought: &quot;Now that is a real Arahant ascetic, who goes round on
all fours, sprawling on the ground, and chewing and eating his food
with his mouth alone.&quot; And I, knowing his thought in my own
mind, said to him: &quot;You foolish man, do you claim to be a
follower of the Sakyan?&quot; &quot;Lord, what do you mean by this
question?&quot; [7] &quot;Sunakkhatta, did you not, on seeing that
naked ascetic going around on all fours, think: 'Now that is a real
Arahant ascetic, who goes round on all fours, sprawling on the
ground, and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone'?&quot;
&quot;I did, Lord. Does the Blessed Lord begrudge others their
Arahantship?&quot; &quot;I do not begrudge others their Arahantship,
you foolish man! It is only in you that this evil view has arisen.
Cast it aside lest it should be to your harm and sorrow for a long
time! This naked ascetic Korakkhattiya, whom you regard as a true
Arahant, will die in seven days from indigestion,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote731anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote731sym"><SUP>731</SUP></A></SUP>

are the very lowest grade of asuras.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote732anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote732sym"><SUP>732</SUP></A></SUP>
And when he is dead he will be cast aside on a heap of birana-grass
in the charnel-ground. If you want to, Sunakkhatta, you can go to him
and ask him if he knows his fate. And it may be that he will tell
you: 'Friend Sunakkhatta, I know my fate. I have been reborn among
the Kalakanja asuras, the very lowest grade of asuras.&quot;'</P>

i.8. 'Then Sunakkhatta went to Korakkhattiya and told him what I had
prophesied, [8] adding: &quot;Therefore, friend Korakkhattiya, be
very careful what you eat and drink, so that the ascetic Gotama's
words may be proved wrong!&quot; And Sunakkhatta was so sure that the
Tathagata's words would be proved wrong that he counted up the seven
days one by one. But on the seventh day Korakkhattiya died of
indigestion, and when he was dead he reappeared among the Kalakanja
asuras, and his body was cast aside on a heap of bfrana-grass in the
charnel-ground.</P>

struck the body three times with his hand, and said: &quot;Friend
Korakkhattiya, do you know your fate?&quot; And Korakkhattiya sat up
and rubbed his back with his hand, and said: &quot;Friend
Sunakkhatta, I know my fate. I have been reborn among the Kalakanja
asuras, the very lowest grade of asuras.&quot; And with that, he fell
back again.</P>

not?&quot; &quot;It has come about the way you said, Lord, and not
otherwise.&quot; [g] &quot;Well, what do you think, Sunakkhatta? Has
a miracle been performed or not?&quot; &quot;Certainly, Lord, this
being so, a miracle has been performed, and not otherwise.&quot;
&quot;Well then, you foolish man, do you still say to me, after I
have performed such a miracle: 'Well, Lord, you have not performed
any miracles'? Consider, you foolish man, how far the fault is
yours.&quot; And at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and

1.11. 'Once, Bhaggava, I was staying at Vesali, at the Gabled Hall in
the Great Forest. And at that time there was a naked ascetic living
in Vesali called Kalaramutthaka<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote733anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote733sym"><SUP>733</SUP></A></SUP>
who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capital. He had
undertaken seven rules of practice: &quot;As long as I live I will be
a naked ascetic and will not put on any clothes; as long as I live I
will remain chaste and abstain from sexual intercourse; as long as I
live I will subsist on strong drink and meat, abstaining from boiled
rice and sour milk; as long as I live I will never go beyond the
Udena shrine to the east of Vesali, the Gotamaka shrine to the south,
the Sattamba shrine [io] to the west, nor the Bahuputta shrine to the
north.,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote734anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote734sym"><SUP>734</SUP></A></SUP>

1.12. 'Now Sunakkhatta went to see Kalaramutthaka and asked him a
question which he could not answer, and because he could not answer
it he showed signs of anger, rage and petulance. But Sunakkhatta

don't want anything to happen that would be to my lasting harm and
misfortune!&quot;</P>

Kalaramutthaka and ask him a question he could not answer, and did he
not thereupon show signs of anger, rage and petulance? And did you
not think: 'I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offence. I don't
want anything to happen that would be to my lasting harm and
misfortune'?&quot; &quot;I did, Lord. Does the Blessed Lord begrudge
others their Arahantship?&quot; [11] &quot;1 do not begrudge others
their Arahantship, you foolish man. It is only in you that this evil
view has arisen. Cast it aside lest it should be to your harm and
sorrow for a long time! This naked ascetic Kalaramutthaka, whom you
regard as a true Arahant, will before long be living clothed and
married, subsisting on boiled rice and sour milk. He will go beyond
all the shrines of Vesali, and will die having entirely lost his
reputation.&quot; And indeed all this came about.</P>

in Vesali called Patikaputta, who enjoyed great gains and fame in the
Vajjian capital. And he made this declaration in the assembly of
Vesali: &quot;The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom, and I
make the same claim. It is right that a man of wisdom should show it
by performing miracles. If the ascetic Gotama will come half-way to
meet me, I will do likewise. Then we could both work miracles, and if
the ascetic Gotama performs one miracle, I will perform two. If he
performs two, I will perform [13] four. And if he performs four, I

his own mind what would happen to Patikaputta? Or has some deva told
the Tathagata?&quot; &quot;Sunakkhatta, I know it by my own mind, and
I have also been told by a deva. [15] For Ajita, the general of the
Licchavis, died the other day and has been reborn in the company of
the Thirty-Three Gods. He came to see me and told me: 'Lord,
Patikaputta the naked ascetic is an impudent liar! He declared in the
Vajjian capital: &quot;Ajita, the general of the Licchavis, has been
reborn in the great hell!&quot; But I have not been reborn in the
great hell, but in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods. He is an
impudent liar...' Thus, Sunakkhatta, I know what I have said by my
own mind, but I have also been told by a deva. And now, Sunakkhatta,
I will go into Vesali for alms. On my return, after I have eaten, I
will go for my midday rest to Patikaputta's park. You may tell him

are going to work miracles! Let us go along!&quot; And he went to the
distinguished and wealthy Brahmins and householders, and to the
ascetics and Brahmins of various schools, and told them the same

to your park, and the ascetic Gotama has gone there for his midday
rest. Because you declared to the assembly at Vesali: 'The ascetic
Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom, and I make the same claim ...

bottom stuck to the seat, or is the seat stuck to your bottom? You
keep saying: 'I'm coming, friend, I'm coming!', but you only wriggle

roar three times, and then make for the cattle-pasture. I could then
pick out the very best of the herd for my kill and, having had a good
feast of tender meat, return to my lair.' And he did accordingly.

accordingly and emerging in the evening, he surveyed the four
quarters, and then thought: 'Now I will roar a lion's roar three
times', - and he gave out the howl of his kind, a jackal howl. For
what has the wretched howl of a jackal in common with a lion's roar?
In just the same way, Patikaputta, you live off the achievements of
