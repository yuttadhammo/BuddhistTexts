Nalanda<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
with a large company of some five hundred monks. And the wanderer

opposing each other's arguments, followed close behind the Lord and

1.2. Then the Lord stopped for one night with his monks at the royal

them. And thus disputing, they followed close behind the Buddha and
his order of monks.</P>

1.3. Now in the early morning a number of monks, having got up,
gathered together and sat in the Round Pavilion, and this was the

the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fullyenlightened Buddha knows,
sees and clearly distinguishes the different inclinations of beings!
For here is the wanderer Suhpiya finding fault in all sorts of ways

Brahmadatta in various ways defends them. And, still disputing, they
follow donely behind the Blessed Lord and his order of monks.'</P>

said: 'Monks, what was the subject of your conversation just now?

Dhamma or of the Sangha,[3] you should not be angry, resentful or
upset on that account. If you were to be angry or displeased at such
disparagement, that would only be a hindrance to you. For if others
disparage me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, and you are angry or
displeased, can you recognise whether what they say is right or not?'
'No, Lord.' 'If others disparage me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, then
you must explain what is incorrect as being incorrect, saying: &quot;That

do as Your Majesty wishes.' And King Ajatasattu, having placed his
wives each on one of the five hundred she-elephants, mounted the
royal tusker and proceeded in royal state, accompanied by
torch-bearers, from Rajagaha towards Jivaka's mango-grove.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
10. And when King Ajatasattu came near the mango-grove he felt fear
and terror, and his hair stood on end. And feeling [50] this fear and
the rising of the hairs, the King said to Jivaka: 'Friend Jivaka, you
are not deceiving me? You are not tricking me? You are not delivering
me up to an enemy? How is it that from this great number of twelve
hundred and fifty monks not a sneeze, a cough or a shout is to be
heard?'</P>

11. So King Ajatasattu, having ridden on his elephant as far as the
ground would permit, alighted and continued on foot to the door of
the round pavilion. Then he said: Jivaka, where is the Lord?' 'That

12. Then King Ajatasattu went up to the Lord and stood to one side,
and standing there to one side the King observed how the order of
monks continued in silence like a clear lake, and he exclaimed: 'If
only Prince Udayabhadda were possessed of such calm as this order of
monks!'</P>

If he lives the household life he will become a ruler, a
wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote134anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote134sym"><SUP>134</SUP></A></SUP>
conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of
his realm and is possessed of the [89] seven treasures.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote135anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote135sym"><SUP>135</SUP></A></SUP>
These are: the Wheel-Treasure, the ElephantTreasure, the
Horse-Treasure, the Jewel-Treasure, the WomanTreasure, the
Householder-Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor-Treasure. He
has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature,
conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered this
sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law. But if he goes
forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become
an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, one who draws back the veil
from the world.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote136anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote136sym"><SUP>136</SUP></A></SUP>
And, Ambattha, I am the passer-on of the mantras, and you are the

1.6. 'Very good, sir', said Ambattha at Pokkharasati's words, and he
got up, passed by Pokkharasati with his right side, got into his
chariot drawn by a mare and, accompanied by a number of young men,
headed for the dense jungle of Icchanankala. He drove as far as the
carriage would go, then alighted and continued on foot.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.7. At that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the

Gotama to be found just now? We have come to see the Reverend
Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.8. The monks thought: 'This is Ambattha, a youth of good family and
a pupil of the distinguished Brahmin Pokkharasati. The Lord would not
mind having a conversation with such a young man.' And they said to
Ambattha: 'That is his dwelling, with the door closed. Go quietly up
to it, go on to the verandah without haste, cough, and knock on the
bolt. The Lord will open the door to you.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.9. Ambattha went up to the dwelling and on to the verandah,
coughed, and knocked. The Lord opened the door, and Ambattha went in.
The young men entered, exchanged courtesies with the Lord, and sat
down to one side. But Ambattha walked up and down while the Lord sat
there, [90] uttered some vague words of politeness, and then stood so
speaking before the seated Lord.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.10. And the Lord said to Ambattha: 'Well now, Ambattha, would you
behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned
Brahmins, teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and
standing while I am sitting, and uttering vague words of politeness?'
'No, Reverend Gotama. A Brahmin should walk with a walking Brahmin,
stand with a standing Brahmin, sit with a sitting Brahmin, and lie
down with a Brahmin who is lying down. But as for those shaven little
ascetics, menials, black scourings from Brahma s foot, with them it
is fitting to speak just as I do with the Reverend Gotama.'</P>

1.11. 'But, Ambattha, you came here seeking something. Whatever it

1.12. But Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called
untrained, and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults.
Thinking: 'The ascetic Gotama bears me ill-will', he said: 'Reverend
Gotama, the Sakyans are fierce, rough-spoken, touchy [91] and
violent. Being of menial origin, being menials, they do not honour,
respect, esteem, revere or pay homage to Brahmins. With regard to
this it is not proper... that they do not pay homage to Brahmins.'

menials.</P>

'Reverend Gotama, once I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my
teacher, the Brahmin Pokkharasati, and I came to the Sakyans'
meeting-hall. And at that time a lot of Sakyans were sitting on high
seats in their meeting-hall, poking each other with their fingers,
laughing and playing about together, and it seemed to me that they
were just making fun of me, and no one offered me a seat. With regard
to this, it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the
Brahmins.' This was the second time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of
being menials.</P>

the Khattiyas, the Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans. And of
these four castes three - the Khattiyas, the merchants and the
artisans - are entirely subservient to the Brahmins. With regard to
this, [92] it is not proper that they should not pay homage to the
Brahmins.' This was the third time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of
being menials.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.15. Then the Lord thought: 'This young man goes too far in abusing
the Sakyans. Suppose I were to ask after his clanname?' So he said:
'Ambattha, what is your clan?' 'I am a Kanhayan, Reverend Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Ambattha, in former days, according to those who remember the
ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are
descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans. For the Sakyans regard
King Okkaka as their ancestor. At one time King Okkaka, to whom his
queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her
son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom - Okkamukha,
Karandu, Hatthiniya and Sinipura. And these, being banished, made
their home on the flank of the Himalayas beside a lotus-pond where
there was a big grove of teak-trees.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote138anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote138sym"><SUP>138</SUP></A></SUP>
And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own
sisters. Then King Okkaka asked his ministers and counsellors: &quot;Where
are the princes living now?&quot; and they told him. At this King
Okkaha exclaimed: [93] &quot;They are strong as teak (saka), these
princes, they are real Sakyans!&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote139anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote139sym"><SUP>139</SUP></A></SUP>

was the ancestor of the Sakyans.</P>

1.16. 'Now King Okkaka had a slave-girl called Disa, who gave birth
to a black child. The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed: &quot;Wash
me, mother! Bath me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt, and I will
bring you profit!&quot; Because, Ambattha, just as people today use
the term hobgoblin (pisaca) as a term of abuse, so in those days they
said black (kanha). And they said: &quot;As soon as he was born, he
spoke. He is born a Kanha, a hobgoblin!&quot; That is how in former
days ... the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a
slavegirl of the Sakyans.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.17. On hearing this, the young men said: 'Reverend Gotama, do not
humiliate Ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a
slave-girl: Ambattha is well-born, of a good family, he is very
learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, well able to hold his own in
this discussion with the Reverend Gotama!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.18. Then the Lord said to the young men: 'If you consider that
Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, unlearned, [94]
ill-spoken, no scholar, unable to hold his own in this discussion
with the ascetic Gotama, then let Ambattha be silent, and you conduct
this discussion with me. But if you think he is... able to hold his

1.20. Then the Lord said to Ambattha: 'Ambattha, I have a fundamental
question for you, which you will not like to answer. If you don't
answer, or evade the issue, if you keep silent or go away, your head
will split into seven pieces. What do you think, Ambattha? Have you
heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where
the Kanhayans came from, or who was their ancestor?' At this,
Ambattha remained silent. The Lord asked him a second time. [95]
Again Ambattha remained silent, and the Lord said: 'Answer me now,
Ambattha, this is not a time for silence. Whoever, Ambattha, does not
answer a fundamental question put to him by a Tathagata by the third
asking has his head split into seven pieces.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote140anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote140sym"><SUP>140</SUP></A></SUP></P>

1.21. And at that moment Vajirapani the yakkha,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote141anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote141sym"><SUP>141</SUP></A></SUP>
holding a huge iron club, flaming, ablaze and glowing, up in the sky
just above Ambattha, was thinking: 'If this young man Ambattha does
not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the
third time of asking, I'll split his head into seven pieces!' The
Lord saw Vajirapani, and so did Ambattha. And at the sight, Ambattha
was terrified and unnerved, his hairs stood on end, and he sought
protection, shelter and safety from the Lord. Crouching down close to
the Lord, he said: 'What did the Reverend Gotama say? May the
Reverend Gotama repeat what he said!' 'What do you think, Ambattha?
Have you heard who was the ancestor of the Kanhayans?' 'Yes, I have
heard it just as the Reverend Gotama said, that is where the
Kanhayans came from, he was their ancestor.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.22. Hearing this, the young men made a loud noise and clamour: 'So
Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, born of a slave-girl of
the Sakyans, and the Sakyans are Ambattha's masters! We disparaged
the ascetic Gotama, thinking he was not speaking the truth!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.23. Then the Lord thought: 'It is too much, [96] the way these
young men humiliate Ambattha for being the son of a slave-girl. I
must get him out of this.' So he said to the young men: 'Don't
disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave-girl! That
Kanha was a mighty sage.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote142anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote142sym"><SUP>142</SUP></A></SUP>

Okkaka and asked for his daughter Maddarupi. And King Okkaka,
furiously angry, exclaimed: &quot;So this fellow, the son of a

But he was unable either to shoot the arrow or to withdraw it.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote144anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote144sym"><SUP>144</SUP></A></SUP>

favour of King Pasenadi of Kosala. And yet the King does not allow
him to have audience face to face. When he confers with the King it
is through a curtain. Why should the King not grant audience face to
face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of

2.7. 'What do you think, Ambattha? Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting
on the neck of an elephant or on horseback, or was standing on the
chariot-mat, conferring with his ministers and princes about
something. [104] And suppose he were to step aside and some workman
or workman's servant were to come along and stand in his place. And
standing there he might say: &quot;This is what King Pasenadi of

2.9. 'What do you think, Ambattha? What have you heard said by
Brahmins who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Those
first sages..., Atthaka,... Bhagu - did they enjoy themselves,
well-bathed, perfumed, their hair and beards trimmed, adorned with

2.11 Then, descending from his lodging, the Lord started to walk up
and down, and Ambattha did likewise. And as he walked along with the
Lord, Ambattha looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on
the Lord's body. And he could see all of them except [106] for two.
He was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks: he could not
make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the
large tongue.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.12. And the Lord, being aware of his doubts, effected by his
psychic power that Ambattha could see his sheathed genitals, and
then, sticking out his tongue, he reached out to lick both ears and
both nostrils, and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with
his tongue. Then Ambattha thought: 'The ascetic Gotama is equipped
with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none
missing.' Then he said to the Lord: 'Reverend Gotama, may I go now? I
have much business, much to do.' 'Ambattha, do what you now think
fit.' So Ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and
departed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.13. Meanwhile the Brahmin Pokkharasati had gone outside and was
sitting in his park with a large number of Brahmins, just waiting for
Ambattha. Then Ambattha came to the park. He rode in the chariot as
far as it would go, and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati
was, saluted him, and sat down to one side. Then Pokkharasati said:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.14. 'Well, dear boy, did you see the Reverend Gotama?' 'I did,

'And was the Reverend Gotama such [107] as he is reported to be, and
not otherwise? And is he of such nature, and not otherwise?' 'Sir, he
is as he is reported to be, and he is of such nature and not
otherwise. He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man,
all complete, with none missing.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'But was there any conversation between you and the ascetic Gotama?'
'There was, sir.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'And what was this conversation about?' So Ambattha told Pokkharasati
all that had passed between the Lord and himself.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.15. At this Pokkharasati exclaimed: 'Well, you're a fine little
scholar, a fine wise man, a fine expert in the Three Vedas! Anyone
going about his business like that ought when he dies, at the
breaking-up of the body, to go to the downfall, to the evil path, to
ruin, to hell! You have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama, as a
result of which he has brought up more and more things against us!
You're a fine little scholar ...!' He was so angry and enraged that
he kicked Ambattha over, and wanted to start out at once to see the
Lord. [108]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.16. But the Brahmins said: 'It is far too late, sir, to go to see
the ascetic Gotama today. The Reverend Pokkharasati should go to see
him tomorrow.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Then Pokkharasati, having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his
own home, set out by the light of torches from Ukkattha for the
jungle of Icchanankala. He went by chariot as far as possible, then
continued on foot to where the Lord was. Having exchanged courtesies
with the Lord, he sat down to one side and said:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.17. 'Venerable Gotama, did not our pupil Ambattha come to see you?'
'He did, Brahmin.' 'And was there any conversation between you?'
'There was.' 'And what was this conversation about?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Then the Lord told Pokkharasati all that had passed between him and
Ambattha. At this, Pokkharasati said to the Lord: 'Reverend Gotama,
Ambattha is a young fool. May the Reverend Gotama pardon him.'
'Brahmin, may Ambattha be happy.' [109]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.18-19. Then Pokkharasati looked out for the thirty-two marks of a
Great Man on the Lord's body and he could see all of them except for
two: the sheathed genitals and the large tongue; but the Lord set his
mind at rest about these (as verse 11-12). And Pokkharasati said to
the Lord: 'May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from me today
together with his order of monks!' And the Lord consented by silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.20. Seeing his acceptance, Pokkharasati said to the Lord: 'It is
time, Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready.' And the Lord, having
dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and howl,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote154anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote154sym"><SUP>154</SUP></A></SUP>
went with his order of monks to Pokkharasati's residence, and sat
down on the prepared seat. Then Pokkharasati personally served the
Lord with choice hard and soft food, and the young men served the
monks. And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl,
Pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stool.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.21 And as Pokkharasati sat there, [iio] the Lord delivered a
graduated discourse on generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing
the danger, degradation and corruption of sensedesires, and the
profit of renunciation. And when the Lord knew that Pokkharasati's
mind was ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm,
then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief: on suffering, its
origin, its cessation, and the path. And just as a clean cloth from
which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly, so in
the Brahmin Pokkharasati, as he sat there, there arose the pure and
spotless Dhamma-eye, and he knew: 'Whatever things have an origin
must come to cessation.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote155anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote155sym"><SUP>155</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.22. And Pokkharasati, having seen, attained, experienced and
penetrated the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended
uncertainty, having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher's
doctrine without relying on others, said: 'Excellent, Lord,
excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked
down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an
oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what
was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in
various ways ...I go with my son, my wife, my ministers and
counsellors for refuge to the Reverend Gotama, to the Dhamma and to
the Sangha.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote156anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote156sym"><SUP>156</SUP></A></SUP>
May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a layfollower who has taken
refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last! And whenever
the Reverend Gotama visits other families or lay-followers in
Ukkattha, may he also visit the family of Pokkharasati! Whatever
young men and maidens are there will revere the Reverend Gotama and
rise before him, will give him a seat and water and will be glad at
heart, and that will be for their welfare and happiness for a long
time.'</P>

Sonadanda Sutta: About Sonadanda - The Qualities of a True Brahmin</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[111] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was travelling among the
Angas with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he arrived
at Campa. At Campa he stayed by Gaggara's lotus-pond. At that time
the Brahmin Sonadanda was living at Campa, a populous place, full of
grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King
Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. And the Brahmins and householders of Campa heard say: 'The ascetic
Gotama of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is
travelling among the Angas ... and is staying by Gaggara's
lotus-pool. And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has
been spread about: &quot;This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a
fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a
Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be
tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.&quot; He
proclaims this world with its gods, maras, Brahmas, the world of
ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to
know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in
its beginning, lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending, in the
spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected,
thoroughly purified holy life. And indeed it is good to see such
Arahants.' [112] Thereupon the Brahmins and householders of Campa,
leaving Campa in great crowds, in vast numbers, went to Gaggara's
lotus-pond.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Just then, the Brahmin Sonadanda had gone up to his verandah for
his midday rest. Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for
Gaggara's lotus-pond, he asked his steward the reason.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Sir, it is the ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans ... That is why they
are going to see him.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Well then, steward, go to the Brahmins and householders of Campa and
say to them: &quot;Please wait, gentlemen, the Brahmin Sonadanda will
come to see the ascetic Gotama.&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
And the steward conveyed this message to [113] the Brahmins and
householders of Campa.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. Now at that time some five hundred Brahmins from various provinces
were in Campa on some business, and they heard that Sonadanda
intended to visit the ascetic Gotama. So they called upon him and
asked if this were true. 'So it is, gentlemen, I am going to visit
the ascetic Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. 'Sir, do not visit the ascetic Gotama, it is not fitting that you
should do so! If the Reverend Sonadanda goes to visit the ascetic
Gotama, his reputation will decrease, and that of the ascetic Gotama
will increase. This being so, it is not right that the Reverend
Sonadanda should visit the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic
Gotama should visit him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'The Reverend Sonadanda is well-born on both the mother's and the
father's side, of pure descent to the seventh generation, unbroken,
of irreproachable birth, and therefore he should not call on the
ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should call on him. The
Reverend Sonadanda is possessed of great wealth and resources...
[114] The Reverend Sonadanda is a scholar, versed in the mantras,
accomplished in the Three Vedas, a skilled expounder of the rules and
rituals, the lore of sounds and meanings and, fifthly, oral tradition
- an expounder, fully versed in natural philosophy and the marks of a
Great Man. The Reverend Sonadanda is handsome, good-looking,
pleasing, of the most beautiful complexion, in form and countenance
like Brahma, of no mean appearance. He is virtuous, of increasing
virtue, endowed with increasing virtue. He is well-spoken, of
pleasing address, polite, of pure and clear enunciation, speaking to
the point. He is the teacher's teacher of many, teaching the mantras
to three hundred youths, and many young men come from different
districts and regions seeking to learn the mantras in his presence,
desirous to learn them from him. He is aged, grown old, venerable,
advanced in years, long past his youth, whereas the ascetic Gotama is
youthful and newly gone forth as a wanderer. The Reverend Sonadanda
is esteemed, made much of, honoured, revered, worshipped by King
Seniya Bimbisara and by the Brahmin Pokkharasati. He lives at Campa,
a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which has
been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal
gift, and with royal powers. This being so, it is not proper that he
should visit the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should
visit him.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote157anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote157sym"><SUP>157</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. At this Sonadanda replied: [115] 'Now listen, gentlemen, as to why
it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama, and why it is not
fitting for him to visit us. The ascetic Gotama is well-born on both
sides of pure descent to the seventh generation, unbroken, of it
reproachable birth... (as verse 5). Therefore it is fitting for us to
visit him. He went forth, leaving a great body of kinsmen. In fact he
gave up much gold and wealth to go forth, both hidden away and openly
displayed. The ascetic Gotama, while youthful, a black-haired youth,
in the prime of his young days, in the first stage of life went forth
from the household life into homelessness. Leaving his grieving
parents weeping with tear-stained faces, having cut off his hair and
beard and put on yellow robes, he went forth into homelessness. He is
handsome,... virtuous,... wellspoken,... the teacher's teacher of
many. He has abandoned sensuality and dispelled vanity. He teaches
action and the results of action, honouring the blameless Brahmin way
of life. He is a wanderer of high birth, of a leading Khattiya
family. He is a wanderer from a wealthy family, of great wealth and
possessions. [116] People come to consult him from foreign kingdoms
and foreign lands. Many thousands of devas have taken refuge with
him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'This good report has been spread about him: &quot;This Blessed Lord
is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and
conduct...&quot; (as verse 2). He bears the thirtytwo marks of a
Great Man. He is welcoming, kindly of speech, courteous, genial,
clear and ready of speech. He is attended by four assemblies,
revered, honoured, esteemed and worshipped by them. Many devas and
humans are devoted to him. Whenever he stays in any town or village,
that place is not troubled by non-human beings. He has a crowd, a
multitude of followers, is a teacher of many, he is consulted by the
chief of the various leaders of sects. It is not the way with the
ascetic Gotama's reputation, as it is with that of some ascetics and
Brahmins, about whom this or that is reported - the ascetic Gotama's
fame is based on his achievement of unsurpassed wisdom and conduct.
Indeed King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha has gone for refuge to him
together with his son, his wife, his followers and his ministers. So
have King Pasenadi of Kosala and the Brahmin Pokkharasati. He is
revered, honoured, esteemed and worshipped by them. [117]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Campa and is staying by Gaggara’s
lotus-pond. And whatever ascetics and Brahmins come to our territory
are our guests. And we should revere, honour, esteem and worship
guests. Having come to Gaggara's lotus-pond, the ascetic Gotama is
such a guest, and should be treated as such. Therefore it is not
proper that he should come to us, but rather we should go to him.
However much I might praise the ascetic Gotama, that praise is
insufficient, he is beyond all praise.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. On hearing this, the Brahmins said to Sonadanda: 'Sir, since you
praise the ascetic Gotama so much, then even if he were to live a
hundred yojanas from here, it would be fitting for a believing
clansman to go with a shoulder-bag to visit him. And so, sir, we
shall all go to visit the ascetic Gotama.' And so Sonadanda went with
a large company of Brahmins to Gaggara's lotus-pond.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. But when Sonadanda had traversed the jungle-thickets, he thought:
'If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question, he might say to me: &quot;That,
Brahmin, is not a fitting question, it is not at all a fitting
question&quot;, and then the company might despise me, saying:
&quot;Sonadanda is a fool, he has no sense, [118] he can't put a
proper question to the ascetic Gotama.&quot; And if anyone were
despised by this company, his reputation would suffer, and then his
income would suffer, for our income depends on the gaining of a
reputation. Or if the ascetic Gotama were to ask me a question, my
answer might not satisfy him, and he might say: &quot;That is not the
right way to answer this question.&quot; And then the company might
despise me ... And if, having come into the presence of the ascetic
Gotama, I were to turn away without showing myself, this company
might despise me...'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9. Then Sonadanda approached the Lord, exchanged courtesies with him,
and sat down to one side. Some of the Brahmins and householders made
obeisance to the Lord, some exchanged courtesies with him, some
saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan,
and some sat down to one side in silence. [119]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
10. So Sonadanda took his seat with many thoughts going through his
mind: 'If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question, he might say to me:
&quot;That, Brahmin, is not a fitting question...&quot; If only the
ascetic Gotama would ask me a question from my own field of the Three
Vedas! Then I could give him an answer that would satisfy him!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
11. And the Lord, reading his mind, thought: 'This Sonadanda is
worried. Suppose I were to ask him a question from his own field as a
teacher of the Three Vedas!' So he said to Sonadanda: 'By how many
qualities do Brahmins recognise a Brahmin? How would one declare
truthfully and without falling into falsehood: &quot;I am a
Brahmin&quot;?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
12. Then Sonadanda thought: [120] 'Now what I wanted, hoped for,
desired and longed for has happened ... Now I can give him an answer
that will satisfy him.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
13. Straightening up, and looking round the assembly, he said:
'Reverend Gotama, there are five such qualities ... What are they? A
Brahmin is well-born on both the mother's and the father's side, of
pure descent to the seventh generation,... he is a scholar versed in
the mantras,... he is handsome, pleasing,... he is virtuous,... he is
learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial
ladle. These are the five qualities of a true Brahmin.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
14. 'But if one of these five qualities were omitted, could not one
be recognised as a true Brahmin, being possessed of four of these
qualities?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'It is possible, Gotama. We could leave out appearance, for what does
that matter? If a Brahmin had the other four qualities [121] he could
be recognised as a true Brahmin.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
15. 'But could not one of these four qualities be omitted, leaving
three whereby one could be recognised as a true Brahmin?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'It is possible, Gotama. We could leave out the mantras, for what do
they matter? If he had the other three qualities he could be
recognised as a true Brahmin.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
16. 'But could not one of these three qualities be omitted?’</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'It is possible, Gotama. We could leave out birth, for what does that
matter? If a Brahmin is virtuous, of increasing virtue,... and if he
is learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the
sacrificial ladle - then he can be recognised as a true Brahmin and
truthfully claim to be so.' [122]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
17. At this the Brahmins said to Sonadanda: 'Don't say that,
Sonadanda don't say it! The Reverend Sonadanda is decrying
appearance, the mantras and birth, he is actually adopting the
ascetic Gotama's own words!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
18. Then the Lord said to the Brahmins: 'If you think the Brahmin
Sonadanda is not concentrating on his task, is using wrong words, is
lacking in wisdom, and is not fit to converse with the ascetic
Gotama, then let him cease, and you talk to me. But if you think he
is learned, speaks properly, is wise and fit to converse with the
ascetic Gotama, then you cease and let him speak.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
19. Then Sonadanda said to the Lord: 'Let that be, Reverend Gotama,
and be silent. I will answer in this matter.' To the Brahmins he
said: 'Do not say the Reverend Sonadanda is decrying appearance ...
and adopting the ascetic Gotama's own words! [123] I do not decry
appearance, mantras, or birth.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
20. Now at that time Sonadanda's nephew, a young man called Angaka,

see my nephew Angaka?' 'Yes, sir.'</P>

'Angaka is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of supremely fair
complexion, in form and countenance like Brahma, of no mean
appearance, and there is none in this assembly his equal except the
ascetic Gotama. He is a scholar ...I was his mantra-teacher. He is
well-born on both sides ...I know his parents. But if Angaka were to
take life, take what is not given, commit adultery, tell lies and
drink strong drink - what would good looks, or mantras, or birth
profit him? But it is because a Brahmin is virtuous,... because he is
wise... on account of these two points that he can truthfully
declare:</P>

&quot;I am a Brahmin.&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">

one truthfully declare: &quot;I am a Brahmin&quot;?' [124]</P>

'No, Gotama. For wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is
purified by wisdom: where one is, the other is, the moral man has
wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality

washes the other, or one foot the other, so wisdom is purified by
morality and this combination is called the highest thing in the

22. 'So it is, Brahmin. Wisdom is purified by morality, and morality

23. 'Then listen, Brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will tell

having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world
with its devas, maras and Brahmns, its princes and people. He
preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
displays the fullyperfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes
forth and practises the moralities (Sutta 2, verses 41-63); he guards
the sensedoors, etc. (Sutta 2, verses 64-74). That, Brahmin, is
morality.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote158anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote158sym"><SUP>158</SUP></A></SUP>
He attains the four jhanas (Sutta 2, verses 75-82); he attains
various insights (Sutta 2, verses 83-95), and the cessation of the

Brahmin, is wisdom.'</P>

24. At these words Sonadanda said: 'Excellent, Lord, excellent! It is
as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point
out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a
dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so
the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. And I go
for refuge to the Blessed Lord Gotama, to the Dhamma and to the
Sangha. May the Reverend Gotama accept me from this day forth as a
lay-follower as long as life shall last! And may the Reverend Gotama
and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrow!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
The Lord assented by silence. Then Sonadanda, seeing his assent,
rose, saluted the Lord, passed by to his right and departed. As day
was breaking, he caused hard and soft food to be prepared in his own
home, and when it was ready he announced: 'Reverend Gotama, it is
time; the meal is ready.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
25. And the Lord, having risen early, went with robe and bowl and
attended by his monks to Sonadanda's residence and sat down on the
prepared seat. And Sonadanda served the Buddha and his monks with the
finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfied. And when
the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl, Sonadanda
took a low stool and sat down to one side. Then he said to the Lord:</P>

26. 'Reverend Gotama, if when I have gone into the assembly I were to
rise and salute the Lord, the company would despise me. In that case
my reputation would suffer, and if a man's reputation suffers, his
income suffers ... So if, on entering the assembly, I should join my
palms in greeting, may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had risen
from my seat. And if [126] on entering the assembly I should take off
my turban, may you take it as if I had bowed at your feet. Or if,
when riding in my carriage, I were to alight to salute the Lord, the

Kutadanta Sutta: About Kutadanta - A Bloodless Sacrifice</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[127] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was travelling through
Magadha with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he
arrived at a Brahmin village called Khanumata. And there he stayed at
the Ambalatthika park.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote160anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote160sym"><SUP>160</SUP></A></SUP>
Now at that time the Brahmin Kutadanta was living at Khanumata, a
populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been
given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and
with royal powers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
And Kutadanta planned a great sacrifice: seven hundred bulls, seven
hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred he-goats and
seven hundred rams were all tied up to the sacrificial posts.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote161anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote161sym"><SUP>161</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. And the Brahmins and householders of Khanumata heard say: 'The
ascetic Gotama ... is staying at Ambalatthika. And concerning that
Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has been spread about: &quot;This
Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fullyenlightened Buddha, perfected in
knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled
Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a
Blessed Lord.&quot; [128] He proclaims this world with its gods,
maras and Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its
princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He
teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. And
indeed it is good to see such Arahants.' And at that the Brahmins and
householders, leaving Khanumata in great numbers, went to
Ambalatthika.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Just then, Kutadanta had gone up to his verandah for his midday
rest. Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for
Ambalatthika, he asked his steward the reason. The steward replied:
'Sir, it is the ascetic Gotama, concerning whom a good report has
been spread about: &quot;This Blessed Lord is an Arahant,... a
Buddha, a Blessed Lord&quot;. That is why they are going to see him.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. Then Kutadanta thought: 'I have heard that the ascetic Gotama
understands how to conduct successfully the triple sacrifice with its
sixteen requisites. Now I do not understand all this, but I want to
make a big sacrifice. Suppose [129] I were to go to the ascetic
Gotama and ask him about the matter.' So he sent his steward to the
Brahmins and householders of Khanumata to ask them to wait for him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. And at that time several hundred Brahmins were staying at
Khanumata intending to take part in Kutadanta's sacrifice. Hearing of
his intention to visit the ascetic Gotama, they went and asked him if
this were true. 'So it is, gentlemen, I am going to visit the ascetic
Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. 'Sir, do not visit the ascetic Gotama... (exactly the same
arguments as at Sutta 4, verse 5). [130-131] This being so, it is not
proper that the Reverend Kutadanta should visit the ascetic Gotama,
but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. Then Kutadanta said to the Brahmins: 'Now listen, gentlemen, as to
why it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama, and why it is
not fitting for him to visit us... (exactly the same as Sutta 4,
verse 6). [132-133] The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Khanumata and
is staying at Ambalatthika. And whatever ascetics or Brahmins come to
our territory are our guests ... He is beyond all praise.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. On hearing this, the Brahmins said: 'Sir, since you praise the
ascetic Gotama so much, then even if he were to live a hundred
yojanas from here, it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go
with a shoulder-bag to visit him. And, sir, we shall all go to visit
the ascetic Gotama.' And so Kutadanta went with a large company of
Brahmins to Ambalatthika. He approached the Lord, [134] exchanged
courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. Some of the Brahmins
and householders of Khanumata made obeisance to the Lord, some
exchanged courtesies with him, some saluted him with joined palms,
some announced their name and clan, and some sat down to one side in
silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9. Sitting to one side, Kutadanta addressed the Lord: 'Reverend
Gotama, I have heard that you understand how to conduct successfully
the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisites. Now I do not
understand all this, but I want to make a big sacrifice. It would be
well if the ascetic Gotama were to explain this to me.' 'Then listen,
Brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will explain.' 'Yes, sir', said
Kutadanta, and the Lord said:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
10. 'Brahmin, once upon a time there was a king called Mahavijita.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote162anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote162sym"><SUP>162</SUP></A></SUP>
He was rich, of great wealth and resources, with an abundance of gold
and silver, of possessions and requisites, of money and money's
worth, with a full treasury and granary. And when King Mahavijita was
musing in private, the thought came to him: &quot;I have acquired
extensive wealth in human terms, I occupy a wide extent of land which
I have conquered. Suppose now I were to make a great sacrifice which
would be to my benefit and happiness for a long time?&quot; And
calling his minister-chaplain,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote163anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote163sym"><SUP>163</SUP></A></SUP>
he told him his thought. [135] &quot;I want to make a big sacrifice.
Instruct me, Reverend Sir, how this may be to my lasting benefit and
happiness.&quot;</P>

11. 'The chaplain replied: &quot;Your Majesty's country is beset by
thieves, it is ravaged, villages and towns are being destroyed, the
countryside is infested with brigands. If Your Majesty were to tax
this region, that would be the wrong thing to do. Suppose Your
Majesty were to think: 'I will get rid of this plague of robbers by
executions and imprisonment, or by confiscation, threats and
banishment', the plague would not be properly ended. Those who
survived would later harm Your Majesty's realm. However, with this
plan you can completely eliminate the plague. To those in the kingdom
who are engaged in cultivating crops and raising cattle, let Your
Majesty distribute grain and fodder; to those in trade, give capital;
to those in government service assign proper living wages. Then those
people, being intent on their own occupations, will not harm the
kingdom. Your Majesty's revenues will be great, the land will be
tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people, with joy in their
hearts, will play with their children, and will dwell in open
houses.&quot;</P>

open houses. Now I wish to make a great sacrifice. Instruct me as to
how this may be done to my lasting benefit and happiness.&quot; &quot;For
this, Sire, you should send for your Khattiyas from town and country,
your advisers and counsellors, the most influential Brahmins and the

13. &quot;'King Mahavijita is endowed with eight things. He is
well-born on both sides,... (as Sutta 4, verse 5) of irreproachable

that is loyal, dependable, making bright his reputation among his
enemies. He is a faithful giver and host, not shutting his door
against ascetics, Brahmins and wayfarers, beggars and the needy - a
fountain of goodness. He is very learned in what should be learnt. He
knows the meaning of whatever is said, saying: 'This is what that
means.' He is a scholar, accomplished, wise, competent to perceive
advantage in the past, the future or the present.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote166anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote166sym"><SUP>166</SUP></A></SUP>
King Mahavijita is endowed with these eight things. These constitute

[138] 14. &quot;'The Brahmin chaplain is endowed with four things. He
is well-born ... He is a scholar, versed in the mantras ... He is
virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue. He is
learned, accomplished and wise, and is the first or second to hold

the accessories to the sacrifice.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
15. 'Then, prior to the sacrifice, the Brahmin chaplain taught the
King the three modes. &quot;It might be that Your Majesty might have
some regrets about the intended sacrifice: 'I am going to lose a lot
of wealth', or during the sacrifice: 'I am losing a lot of wealth',
or after the sacrifice: 'I have lost a lot of wealth.' In such cases,
Your Majesty should not entertain such regrets.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
16. 'Then, prior to the sacrifice, the chaplain dispelled the King's
qualms with ten conditions for the recipient: &quot;Sire, there will
come to the sacrifice those who take life and those who abstain from
taking life. To those who take life, so will it be to them; but those
who abstain from taking life will have a successful sacrifice and
will rejoice in it, and their hearts may be calmed within. There will
come those who take what is not given and those who refrain..., those
who indulge in sexual misconduct and those who refrain..., those who
tell lies..., indulge in calumny, harsh and frivolous speech...,
[139] those who are covetous and those who are not, those who harbour
ill-will and those who do not, those who have wrong views and those
who have right views. To those who have wrong views it will turn out
accordingly, but those who have right views will have a successful
sacrifice and will rejoice in it, and their hearts may be calmed
within.&quot; So the chaplain dispelled the King's doubts with ten
conditions.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
17. 'So the chaplain instructed the King who was making the great
sacrifice with sixteen reasons, urged him, inspired him and gladdened
his heart. &quot;Someone might say: 'King Mahavijita is making a
great sacrifice, but he has not invited his Khattiyas..., his
advisers and counsellors, the most influential Brahmins and wealthy
householders...' But such words would not be in accordance with the
truth, since the King has invited them. Thus the King may know that
he will have a successful sacrifice and rejoice in it, and his heart
will be calmed within. Or someone might say: 'King Mahavijita is
making a great sacrifice, but he is not well-born on both
sides...'[140] But such words would not be in accordance with the
truth ...Or someone might say: 'His chaplain is not
well-born...'[141] But such words would not be in accordance with the
truth.&quot; Thus the chaplain instructed the King with sixteen
reasons...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
18. 'In this sacrifice, Brahmin, no bulls were slain, no goats or
sheep, no cocks and pigs, nor were various living beings subjected to
slaughter, nor were trees cut down for sacrificial posts, nor were
grasses mown for the sacrificial grass, and those who are called
slaves or servants or workmen did not perform their tasks for fear of
blows or threats, weeping and in tears. But those who wanted to do
something did it, those who did not wish to did not: they did what
they wanted to do, and not what they did not want to do. The
sacrifice was carried out with ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey and
molasses. [142]</P>

19. 'Then, Brahmin, the Khattiyas..., the ministers and counsellors,
the influential Brahmins, the wealthy householders of town and
country, having received a sufficient income, came to King Mahavijita
and said: &quot;We have brought sufficient wealth, Your Majesty,
please accept it.&quot; &quot;But, gentlemen, I have collected
together sufficient wealth. Whatever is left over, you take away.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'At the King's refusal, they went away to one side and consulted
together: &quot;It is not right for us to take this wealth back to
our own homes. The King is making a great sacrifice. Let us follow
his example.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
20. 'Then the Khattiyas put their gifts to the east of the
sacrificial pit, the advisers and counsellors set out theirs to the
south, the Brahmins to the west and the wealthy householders to the
north. And in this sacrifice no bulls were slain,... nor were living
beings subjected to slaughter ... Those who wanted to do something
did it, those who did not wish to did not... The sacrifice was
carried out with ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey and molasses.[143]
Thus there were the four assenting groups, and King Mahavijita was
endowed with eight things, and the chaplain with four things in three
modes. This, Brahmin, is called the sixteenfold successful sacrifice
in three modes.'</P>

sat in silence. And the Brahmins asked him why he did not applaud the

applaud them. My head would split open if I did not.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote167anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote167sym"><SUP>167</SUP></A></SUP>
But it strikes me that the ascetic Gotama does not say: &quot;I have
heard this&quot;, or &quot;It must have been like this&quot;, but he
says: &quot;It was like this or like that at the time.&quot; And so,
gentlemen, it seems to me that the ascetic Gotama must have been at
that time either King Mahavijita, the lord of the sacrifice, or else
the Brahmin chaplain who conducted the sacrifice for him. Does the
Reverend Gotama acknowledge that he performed, or caused to be
performed, such a sacrifice, and that in consequence at death, after
the breaking-up of the body, he was reborn in a good sphere, a
heavenly state?' 'I do, Brahmin. I was the Brahmin chaplain who
conducted that sacrifice.'</P>

Thus a monk is perfected in morality. He attains the four jhanas
(Sutta 2, verses 75-82). That, Brahmin, is a sacrifice ...more
profitable. He attains various insights (Sutta 2, verse 83-95), and
the cessation of the corruptions (Sutta 2, verse 97). He knows:
&quot;There is nothing further in this world.&quot; That, Brahmin, is
a sacrifice that is simpler, less difficult, more fruitful and more
profitable than all the others. And beyond this there is no sacrifice
that is greater and more perfect.'</P>

to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one
who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that
those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Reverend Gotama
has expounded the Dhamma in various ways, May the Reverend Gotama
accept me as a lay-follower from this day forth as long as life shall
last! And, [148] Reverend Gotama, I set free the seven hundred bulls,
seven hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred he-goats

29. Then the Lord delivered a graduated discourse to Kutadanta, on
generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing the danger,
degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of
renunciation. And when the Lord knew that Kutadanta's mind was ready,
pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm, then he preached
a sermon on Dhamma in brief: on suffering, its origin, its cessation,
and the path. And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have
been removed receives the dye perfectly, so in the Brahmin Kutadanta,
as he sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye, and he
knew: 'Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation.'</P>

30. Then Kutadanta, having seen, attained, experienced and penetrated
the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended uncertainty,
having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher's doctrine without
relying on others, said: 'May the Reverend Gotama and his order of
monks accept a meal from me tomorrow!'</P>

The Lord assented by silence. Then Kutadanta, seeing his consent,

satisfied. And when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from

[150] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Vesali, at
the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. And at that time a large number
of Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were staying at Vesali
on some business. And they heard say: 'The ascetic Gotama, son of the
Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan, is staying at
Vesali, at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. And concerning that
Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about: &quot;This Blessed
Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in
knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled
Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a
Blessed Lord.&quot; He proclaims this world with its gods, maras and
Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and
peoples, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a
Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle and
lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he
displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. And
indeed it is good to see such Arahants.'</P>

2. And so these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha went to
the Great Forest, to the Gabled Hall. At that time the Venerable
Nagita was the Lord's personal attendant. So they approached the
Venerable Nagita and said: 'Reverend Nagita, where is the Reverend

[178] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, in
Jeta's grove, in Anathapindika's park. And at that time the wanderer
Potthapada was at the debating-hall near the Tinduka tree, in the
single-halled park of Queen Mallika,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote194anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote194sym"><SUP>194</SUP></A></SUP>

2. Then the Lord, rising early, took his robe and bowl and went to
Savatthi for alms. But it occurred to him: 'It is too early to go to
Savatthi for alms. Suppose I were to go to the debating-hall to see
the wanderer Potthapada?' And he did so.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. There Potthapada was sitting with his crowd of wanderers, all
shouting and making a great commotion, indulging in various kinds of
unedifying conversation, such as about kings, robbers, ministers,
armies, dangers, wars, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands,
perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns and cities, [179]
countries, women, heroes, street- and well-gossip, talk of the
departed, desultory chat, speculations about land and sea, talk of
being and non-being.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. But Potthapada saw the Lord coming from a distance, and so he
called his followers to order, saying: 'Be quiet, gentlemen, don't
make a noise, gentlemen! That ascetic Gotama is coming, and he likes
quiet and speaks in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is
quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us.' At this the
wanderers fell silent.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. Then the Lord came to Potthapada, who said: 'Come, reverend Lord,
welcome, reverend Lord! At last the reverend Lord has gone out of his
way to come here. Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
The Lord sat down on the prepared seat, and Potthapada hook a low

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">

I interrupted?'</P>

6. Potthapada replied: 'Lord, never mind the conversation we were
having just now, it will not be difficult for the Lord to hear about
that later. In the past few days, Lord, the discussion among the
ascetics and Brahmins of various schools, sitting together and
meeting in the debating-hall, has concerned [180] the higher
extinction of consciousness,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote195anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote195sym"><SUP>195</SUP></A></SUP>
and how this takes place. Some said: &quot;One's perceptions arise
and cease without cause or condition. When they arise, one is
conscious, when they cease, then one is unconscious.&quot; That is
how they explained it. But somebody else said: &quot;No, that is not
how it is. Perceptions<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote196anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote196sym"><SUP>196</SUP></A></SUP>
are a person's self, which comes and goes. When it comes, one is
conscious, when it goes, one is unconscious.&quot; Another said:
&quot;That is not how it is. There are ascetics and Brahmins of great
powers, of great influence. They draw down consciousness into a man
and withdraw it. When they draw it down into him, he is conscious,
when they withdraw it, he is unconscious.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote197anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote197sym"><SUP>197</SUP></A></SUP>

7. 'In this matter, Potthapada, those ascetics and Brahmins who say
one's perceptions arise and cease without cause or condition are
totally wrong. Why is that? One's perceptions arise and cease [181]

training, and some pass away through training.' 'What is this
training?', the Lord said. 'Potthapada, a Tathagata arises in this

Kevaddha Sutta: About Kevaddha - What Brahma Didn't Know</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[211] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Nalanda, in
Pavarika's mango grove. And the householder Kevaddha<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote220anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote220sym"><SUP>220</SUP></A></SUP>
came to the Lord, prostrated himself before him, and sat down to one
side. He then said: 'Lord, this Nalanda is rich, prosperous,
populous, and full of people who have faith in the Lord. It would be
well if the Lord were to cause some monk to perform superhuman feats
and miracles. In this way Nalanda would come to have even more faith
in the Lord.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
The Lord replied: 'Kevaddha, this is not the way I teach Dhamma to
the monks, by saying: &quot;Go, monks, and perform superhuman feats
and miracles for the white-clothed laypeople!'</P>

2. For a second time Kevaddha said: 'Lord, I would not be
importunate, but I still say: &quot;This Nalanda is rich, prosperous

And the Lord replied as before.</P>

3. When Kevaddha repeated his request for a third time, the Lord

4. 'What is the miracle of psychic power? Here, Kevaddha, a monk
displays various psychic powers in different ways. Being one he
becomes many, being many he becomes one... (as Sutta 2, verse 87)

someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things.</P>

preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes
forth and practises the moralities (Sutta 2, verses 41-63). He guards
the sense-doors and attains the four jhanas (Sutta 2, verses 64-82);

Lohicca Sutta: About Lohicca - Good and Bad Teachers</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[224] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a
large company of some five hundred monks, and, coming to Salavatika,
he stayed there. And at that time the Brahmin Lohicca was living at
Salavatika, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn,
which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal
gift and with royal powers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. Just then this evil line of reasoning occurred to Lohicca:
'Suppose an ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote233anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote233sym"><SUP>233</SUP></A></SUP>
having done so, he ought not to declare it to anyone else; for what
can one man do for another? It is just as if a man, having cut
through an old fetter, were to make a new one. I declare that such a
thing is an evil deed rooted in attachment, for what can one man do
for another?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Then Lohicca heard it said that the ascetic Gotama had arrived at
Salavatika, and that concerning the Blessed Lord Gotama a good report
had been spread about... (as Sutta 4, verse 2). [225] 'And indeed it
is good to see such Arahants.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. And Lohicca said to Bhesika the barber: 'Friend Bhesika, go to the
ascetic Gotama, ask in my name after his health and then say: &quot;May
the Reverend Gotama consent to take tomorrow's meal, with his order
of monks, from the Brahmin Lohicca!&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. 'Very good, sir', said Bhesika, and carried out the errand. The
Lord signified his acceptance by silence.</P>

6. Then Bhesika, understanding the Lord's acceptance, rose from his
seat and passed by with his right side to the Lord. He returned to
Lohicca and told him [226] of the Lord's acceptance.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. And Lohicca, as the night was ending, had choice hard and, soft
foods prepared at his own home. Then he sent Bhesika to tell the Lord
that the meal was ready. And the Lord, having risen early and taken
his robe and bowl, went with his order of monks to Salavatika.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. And Bhesika the barber followed the Lord close at hand. And he

9. So the Lord came to Lohicca's dwelling, and sat down on [227] the
prepared seat. Lohicca personally served the Buddha and his order of
monks with choice hard and soft food till they were contented and
satisfied. When the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl, Lohicca
took a low stool and sat down to one side. Then the Lord said to him:
'Lohicca, is it true that an evil line of reasoning has occurred to
you ... (as verse 2)?' 'Yes, Reverend Gotama.'</P>

fruits and revenues of Salavatika, not giving anything away to

Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, in Anathapindika's park in the
jeta grove, in the Karen hutment. And among a number of monks who had
gathered together after their meal, after the alms-round, sitting in
the Karen pavilion, there arose a serious discussion on former lives,

it was.'</P>

sat together? What discussion did I interrupt?' And they told him.

which was a gatekeeper, wise, skilled and clever, who kept out
strangers and let in those he knew. And he, constantly patrolling and
following along a path, might not see the joins and clefts in the
bastion, even such as a cat might creep through. But whatever larger
creatures entered or left the city, must all go through this very
gate. And it seems to me, Lord, that the drift of the Dhamma is the
same. All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme
enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, defilements of mind
that weaken the understanding, having firmly established the four
foundations of mindfulness in their minds, and realised the seven
factors of enlightenment as they really are. All the Arahant Buddhas
of the future will do likewise, and you, Lord, who are now the

sat down facing east, with his back against the central pillar. And
the monks, having washed their feet, went in and sat down with their
backs to the west wall, facing east, and with the Lord sitting in

their feet, went in and sat down with their backs to the east wall,
facing west and with the Lord before them.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.23. Then the Lord addressed the lay-followers of Pataligama:
'Householders, there are these five perils to one of bad morality, of
failure in morality. What are they? In the first place, he suffers
great loss of property through neglecting his affairs. In the second
place, he gets a bad reputation for immorality and misconduct. In the
third place, whatever assembly he approaches, whether of Khattiyas,
Brahmins, householders or ascetics, he does so diffidently and shyly.
In the fourth place, he dies confused. In the fifth place, after
death, at the breakingup of the body, he arises in an evil state, a
bad fate, in suffering and hell. These are the five perils to one of
bad morality.</P>

wealth. In the second place, he gets a good reputation for morality

approaches, whether of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders or ascetics,
he does so with confidence and assurance. In the fourth place, he
dies unconfused. In the fifth place, after death, at the breaking-up

the five advantages to one of good morality, and of success in

1.25. Then the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted the
lay-followers of Pataligama with talk on Dhamma until far into the
night. Then he dismissed them, saying: 'Householders, the night is
nearly over. Now it is time for you to do as you think fit.' 'Very
good, Lord', they said and, rising and saluting the Lord, they passed
him by to the right and departed. And the Lord spent the remainder of
the night in the rest-house left empty by their departure.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.26. Now at this time Sunidha and Vassakara, the Magadhan ministers,
were building a fortress in Pataligama as a defence against the
Vajjians. And at that time a multitude of [871 thousands of devas
were taking up lodging in Pataligama. And in the parts where powerful
devas settled, they caused the minds of the most powerful royal
officials to pick those sites for their dwellings, and where middle
and lower-ranking devas settled, so too they caused the minds of
royal officials of corresponding grade to pick those sites for their
dwellings.</P>

Ariyan realm extends, as far as its trade extends, this will be the

1.29. Then Sunidha and Vassakara called on the Lord and, having
exchanged courtesies, stood to one side and said: 'May the Reverend
Gotama accept a meal from us tomorrow with his order of monks!' And
the Lord consented by silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.30. Understanding his consent, Sunidha and Vassakara went home and
there had a fine meal of hard and soft food prepared. When it was
ready, they reported to the Lord: 'Reverend Gotama, the meal is
ready.' Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, took his robe
and bowl, went with the order of monks to the residence of Sunidha
and Vassakara, and sat down on the prepared seat. Then Sunidha and
Vassakara served the Buddha and his order of monks with choice soft
and hard foods till they were satisfied. And when the Lord took his
hand away from the bowl they sat down on low stools to one side.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.31. And as they sat there, the Lord thanked them with these verses:</P>

'In whatever realm the wise man makes his home, <BR>He should feed

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.32. Sunidha and Vassakara followed closely behind the Lord, saying:
'Whichever gate the ascetic Gotama goes out by today, that shall be
called the Gotama gate; and whichever ford he uses to cross the
Ganges, that shall be called the Gotama ford.' And so the gate by
which the Lord went out was called the Gotama Gate.</P>

1.33. And then the Lord came to the River Ganges. And just then, the
river was so full that a crow could drink out of it. And some people
were looking for a boat, and some were looking for a raft, and some
were binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. But
the Lord, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm
or flex it again, vanished from this side of the Ganges and
reappeared with his order of monks on the other shore.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.34. And the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat,
looking for a raft, and binding together a raft of reeds to get to

the spot:</P>

'When they want to cross the sea, the lake or pond, People make a

2.2. Then the Lord addressed the monks thus: 'Monks, it is through
not understanding, not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that I as

of Suffering we have fared on, by not understanding the Noble Truth

the prepared seat. And she served the Buddha and his monks with
choice hard and soft food till they were satisfied. And when the Lord
had taken his hand from the bowl, Ambapali took a low stool and [98]
sat down to one side. So seated, she said: 'Lord, I give this park to
the order of monks with the Buddha as its head.' The Lord accepted
the park, and then he instructed, inspired, fired and delighted her

2.23. And during the Rains the Lord was attacked by a severe
sickness, with sharp pains as if he were about to die. But he endured

thought: 'It is not fitting that I should attain final Nibbana
without addressing my followers and taking leave of the order of

4.24. A third time the Lord said: 'Ananda, bring me some water: I am
thirsty and want to drink.' 'Very good, Lord', said Ananda and,
taking his bowl, he went to the stream. And that stream whose water
had been churned up by the wheels and was not good, dirty and

unsullied.</P>

4.25. And the Venerable Ananda thought: 'Wonderful, marvellous are
the Tathagata's great and mighty powers! This water was churned up by
wheels..., and at my approach it flows pure, bright and unsullied!'
He took water in his bowl, brought it to the Lord and told him of his
thought, saying: 'May the Lord drink the water, may the Well-Farer
drink!' And the Lord drank the water. [130]</P>

was going along the main road from Kusinara to Pava. Seeing the Lord
sitting under a tree, he went over, saluted him and sat down to one
side. Then he said: 'It is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous how calm
these wanderers are!</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.27. 'Once, Lord, Alara Kalama was going along the main road and,
turning aside, he went and sat down under a nearby tree to take his
siesta. And five hundred carts went rumbling by very close to him. A
man who was walking along behind them came to Alara Kalama and said:
&quot;Lord, did you not see five hundred carts go by?&quot; &quot;No,
friend, I did not.&quot; &quot;But didn't you hear them, Lord?&quot;
&quot;No, friend, I did not.&quot; &quot;Well, were you asleep,
Lord?&quot; &quot;No, friend, I was not asleep.&quot; &quot;Then,
Lord, were you conscious?&quot; &quot;Yes, friend&quot;. &quot;So,
Lord, being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard five
hundred carts passing close by you, even though your outer robe was
bespattered with dust?&quot; &quot;That is so, friend.&quot;</P>

'And that man thought: &quot;It is wonderful, it is marvellous! These
wanderers are so calm that though conscious [131] and awake, a man
neither saw nor heard five hundred carts passing close by him!&quot;
And he went away praising Alara Kalama's lofty powers.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.28. 'Well, Pukkusa, what do you think? What do you consider is more
difficult to do or attain to - while conscious and awake not to see
or hear five hundred carts passing nearby or, while conscious and
awake, not to see or hear anything when the rain-god streams and
splashes, when lightning flashes and thunder crashes?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.29. 'Lord, how can one compare not seeing or hearing five hundred
carts with that - or even six, seven, eight, nine or ten hundred, or
hundreds of thousands of carts to that? To see or hear nothing when
such a storm rages is more difficult...'</P>

4.30. 'Once, Pukkusa, when I was staying at Atuma, at the
threshing-floor, the rain-god streamed and splashed, lightning

4.31. 'And, Pukkusa, I had at that time gone out of the door of the

him:</P>

4.32. &quot;'Friend, why are all these people gathered here?&quot;
[132] &quot;Lord, there has been a great storm and two farmers,

you been?&quot; &quot;I have been right here, friend.&quot; &quot;But
what did you see, Lord?&quot; &quot;I saw nothing, friend.&quot; &quot;Or
what did you hear, Lord?&quot; &quot;I heard nothing, friend.&quot;
&quot;Were you sleeping, Lord?&quot; &quot;I was not sleeping,
friend.&quot; &quot;Then, Lord, were you conscious?&quot; &quot;Yes,
friend.&quot; &quot;So, Lord, being conscious and awake you neither
saw nor heard the great rainfall and floods and the thunder and
lightning?&quot; &quot;That is so, friend.&quot;</P>

passed by to the right and departed.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.34. At this, Pukkusa the Malla said: 'Lord, I reject the lofty
powers of Alara Kalama as if they were blown away by a mighty wind or
carried off by a swift stream or river! Excellent, Lord, excellent!
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to
point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil lamp
into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there.
Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways.
[133] And I, Lord, go for refuge to the Blessed Lord, the Dhamma and
the Sangha. May the Blessed Lord accept me from this day forth as a
lay-follower as long as life shall last!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.35. Then Pukkusa said to one man: 'Go and fetch me two fine sets of
robes of cloth-of-gold, burnished and ready to wear.' 'Yes, Lord',
the man replied, and did so. And Pukkusa offered the robes to the
Lord, saying: 'Here, Lord, are two fine sets of robes of
cloth-of-gold. May the Blessed Lord be graciously pleased to accept
them!' 'Well then, Pukkusa, clothe me in one set and Ananda in the
other.' 'Very good, Lord', said Pukkusa, and did so.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote411anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote411sym"><SUP>411</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.36. Then the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted Pukkusa
the Malla with a talk on Dhamma. Then Pukkusa rose from his seat,
saluted the Lord, passed by to the right, and departed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.37. Soon after Pukkusa had gone, Ananda, having arranged one set of
the golden robes on the body of the Lord, observed that against the
Lord's body it appeared dulled. And he said: 'It is wonderful, Lord,
it is marvellous how clear and bright the Lord's skin appears! It
looks even brighter than the golden [134] robes in which it is
clothed.' 'Just so, Ananda. There are two occasions on which the
Tathagata's skin appears especially clear and bright. Which are they?
One is the night in which the Tathagata gains supreme enlightenment,
the other is the night when he attains the Nibbana-element without
remainder at his final passing. On these two occasions the
Tathagata's skin appears especially clear and bright.</P>

4.38. 'Tonight, Ananda, in the last watch, in the sal-grove of the

passing will take place. And now, Ananda, let us go to the River
Kakuttha.' 'Very good, Lord', said Ananda.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote412anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote412sym"><SUP>412</SUP></A></SUP></P>

4.39. Then the Lord went with a large number of monks to the River
Kakuttha. He entered the water, bathed and drank and, emerging, went
to the mango grove, where he said to the Venerable Cundaka: 'Come,
Cundaka, fold a robe in four for me. I am tired and want to lie

is your fault, friend Cunda, it is by your misdeed that the Tathagata
gained final Nibbana after taking his last meal from you!&quot; But
Cunda's remorse should be expelled in this way: &quot;That is your

Nibbana after taking his last meal from you! For, friend Cunda, I

alms-givings are of very great [136] fruit, of very great result,
more fruitful and advantageous than any other. Which two? The one is
the alms-giving after eating which the Tathagata attains supreme
enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the
Nibbana-element without remainder at his final passing. These two
alms-givings are more fruitful and profitable than all others.
Cunda's deed is conducive to long life, to good looks, to happiness,
to fame, to heaven and to lordship.&quot; In this way, Ananda,
Cunda's remorse is to be expelled.'</P>

it and covering it in homage. Divine coral-tree flowers fell from the

covering the Tathagata's body [138] in homage. Divine music and song

5.16. 'Ananda has four remarkable and wonderful qualities. What are
they? If a company of monks comes to see Ananda, they are pleased at
the sight of him, and when Ananda talks Dhamma to them they are
pleased, and when he is silent they are disappointed. And so it is,
too, with nuns, with male and female lay-followers.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote428anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote428sym"><SUP>428</SUP></A></SUP>
And these four qualities apply to a wheel-turning monarch: if he is
visited by a company of Khattiyas, of Brahmins, of householders, or
of ascetics, they are pleased at the sight of him and when he talks
to them, and when he is silent they are disappointed. [146] And so
too it is with Ananda.'</P>

5.17. After this the Venerable Ananda said: 'Lord, may the Blessed
Lord not pass away in this miserable little town of wattle-and-daub,
right in the jungle in the back of beyond! Lord, there are other
great cities such as Campa, Rajagaha, Savatthi, Saketa, Kosambi or
Varanasi. In those places there are wealthy Khattiyas, Brahmins and
householders who are devoted to the Tathagata, and they will provide

5.18. 'Once upon a time, Ananda, King Mahasudassana was a
wheel-turning monarch, a rightful and righteous king, who had
conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his
realm, and who possessed the seven treasures. And, Ananda, this King
Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara, under the name of Kusavati, for
his capital. And it was twelve yojanas long from east to west, and
seven yojanas wide from north to south. Kusavati was rich, prosperous
[147] and well-populated, crowded with people and well-stocked with
food. Just as the deva-city of Alakamanda<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote429anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote429sym"><SUP>429</SUP></A></SUP>
is rich, prosperous and well-populated, crowded with yakkhas and
well-stocked with food, so was the royal city of Kusavati. And the
city of Kusavati was never free of ten sounds by day or night: the
sound of elephants, horses, carriages, kettle-drums, side-drums,
lutes, singing, cymbals and gongs, with cries of &quot;Eat, drink and
be merry!&quot; as tenth.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote430anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote430sym"><SUP>430</SUP></A></SUP></P>

5.19. 'And now, Ananda, go to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas of
Kusinara: &quot;Tonight, Vasetthas<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote431anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote431sym"><SUP>431</SUP></A></SUP>
in the last watch, the Tathagata will attain final Nibbana. Approach
him, Vasetthas, approach him, lest later you should regret it,
saying: 'The Tathagata passed away in our parish, and we did not take
the opportunity to see him for the last time!&quot;&quot; 'Very good,
Lord', said Ananda and, taking robe and bowl, he went with a
companion to Kusinara.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.20. Just then the Mallas of Kusinara were assembled in their
meeting-hall on some business. And Ananda came to them and delivered
the Lord's words. [148]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.21. And when they heard Ananda's words, the Mallas, with their
sons, daughters-in-law and wives were struck with anguish and sorrow,
their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all weeping
and tearing their hair ...Then they all went to the sal-grove where
the Venerable Ananda was.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.22. And Ananda thought: 'If I allow the Mallas of Kusinara to
salute the Lord individually, the night will have passed before they
have all paid homage. I had better let them pay homage family by
family, saying: &quot;Lord, the Malla so-and-so with his children,
his wife, his servants and his friends pays homage at the Lord's
feet.&quot;' And so he presented them in that way, and thus allowed
all the Mallas of Kusinara to pay homage to the Lord in the first
watch.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.23. And at that time a wanderer called Subhadda was in Kusinara,
and he heard that the ascetic Gotama was to, attain final Nibbana in
the final watch of that night. [149] He thought: 'I have heard from
venerable wanderers, advanced in years, teachers of teachers, that a
Tathagata, a fully-enlightened Buddha, only rarely arises in the
world. And tonight in the last watch the ascetic Gotama will attain
final Nibbana. Now a doubt has arisen in my mind, and I feel sure
that the ascetic Gotama can teach me a doctrine to dispel that
doubt.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.24. So Subhadda went to the Mallas' sal-grove, to where the
Venerable Ananda was, and told him what he had thought: 'Reverend
Ananda, may I be permitted to see the ascetic Gotama?' But Ananda
replied: 'Enough, friend Subhadda, do not disturb the Tathagata, the
Lord is weary.' And Subhadda made his request a second and a third
time, but still Ananda [150] refused it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.25. But the Lord overheard this conversation between Ananda and
Subhadda, and he called to Ananda: 'Enough, Ananda, do not hinder
Subhadda, let him see the Tathagata. For whatever Subhadda asks me he
will ask in quest of enlightenment<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote432anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote432sym"><SUP>432</SUP></A></SUP>
and not to annoy me, and what I say in reply to his questions he will
quickly understand.' Then Ananda said: 'Go in, friend Subhadda, the
Lord gives you leave.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.26. Then Subhadda approached the Lord, exchanged courtesies with
him, and sat down to one side, saying: 'Venerable Gotama, all those
ascetics and Brahmins who have orders and followings, who are
teachers, well-known and famous as founders of schools, and popularly
regarded as saints, like Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita
Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sanjaya Belatthaputta and the
Nigantha Nataputta - have they all realised the truth as they all
make out, or have none [151] of them realised it, or have some
realised it and some not?' 'Enough, Subhadda, never mind whether all,
or none, or some of them have realised the truth. I will teach you
Dhamma, Subhadda. Listen, pay close attention, and I will speak.'
'Yes, Lord', said Subhadda, and the Lord said:</P>

But such ascetics can be found, of the first, second, third and
fourth grade in a Dhamma and discipline where the Noble Eightfold
Path is found. Now, Subhadda, in this Dhamma and discipline the Noble
Eightfold Path is found, and in it are to be found ascetics of the
first, second, third and fourth grade. Those other schools are devoid
of [true] ascetics; but if in this one the monks were to live the

down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an

'Lord, if those coming from other schools must wait four months on

coming from afar, and said to him: 'Friend, do you know our Teacher?'
'Yes, friend, I do. The ascetic Gotama passed away a week ago. I
picked this coral-tree flower there.' And those monks who had not yet
overcome their passions wept and tore their hair... But those monks
who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware,

that of the devas is another.' 'Well, Lord, what is the intention of

For the Lord not to make such a declaration would cause unhappiness
to the Magadhans. [203] Such being the case, why does not the Lord
make such a declaration?'</P>

for that reason the ThirtyThree Gods were pleased, happy, filled with
delight and joy, saying: 'The devas' hosts are growing, the asuras'

15. &quot;'And then, Lord, a glorious radiance shone forth from the
north, and a splendour was seen greater than the sheen of the devas.

will appear.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote504anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote504sym"><SUP>504</SUP></A></SUP>

[210] the same. Thus they were all agreed.</P>

They all sit silently with palms together,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote508anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote508sym"><SUP>508</SUP></A></SUP>

Rising up in the air, he appeared floating cross-legged, just as a

gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who knows and sees. What
are they? In the first place someone dwells in association with
sense-desires, with unwholesome conditions. At some time he hears the
Ariyan Dhamma, he pays close attention and practises in conformity
with it. By so doing he comes to live dissociated from such
sense-desires and unwholesome conditions. As a result of this
dissociation, pleasant feeling<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote517anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote517sym"><SUP>517</SUP></A></SUP>

of body, speech and thought are not allayed. At some time he hears
the Ariyan Dhamma,... and his gross tendencies of body, speech and

feeling arises, and what is more, gladness...</P>

25. &quot;&quot;In the third place there is someone who really does
not know what is right and what is wrong, what is blameworthy and
what is not, what is to be practised and what is not, what is base
and what is noble, and what is foul, fair or mixed in quality. At
some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma, he pays close attention and
practises in conformity with it. As a result, he comes to know in
reality what is right and wrong, what is blameworthy and what is not,
what is to be practised and what is not, what is base and what is
noble, and what is foul, fair or mixed in quality. In him who knows
and sees thus, ignorance is dispelled and knowledge arises. With the
waning of ignorance and the arising of knowledge, pleasant feeling
arises, and what is more, gladness. Just as pleasure might give birth
to rejoicing, so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladness. [216]

was a Brahmin called the Steward.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote537anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote537sym"><SUP>537</SUP></A></SUP>
The King's son was a youth called Renu, and the Steward's son was
called Jotipala. Prince Renu and Jotipala, together with six other
Khattiyas, formed a band of eight friends. [231] In the course of
time the Steward died, and King Disampati mourned him, saying: 'Alas,
at the very moment when we had entrusted all our responsibilities to
the Steward, and were abandoning ourselves to the pleasures of the
five senses, the Steward has passed away!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'Hearing this, Prince Renu said: 'Sire, do not mourn the
Steward's death overmuch! His son Jotipala<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote538anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote538sym"><SUP>538</SUP></A></SUP>
is cleverer than his father was and has a better eye for what is
advantageous. You should let Jotipala manage all the business you
entrusted to his father.' 'Is that so, my boy?' 'Yes, Sire.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
30. &quot;'Then the King called a man and said: 'Come here, my good
man, go to the youth Jotipala and say: &quot;May the Reverend
Jotipala be well! King Disampati sends for you, he would like to see
you.&quot;' 'Very good, Your Majesty', said the man, and delivered
the message. [232] On receiving the message, Jotipala said: 'Very
good, sir', and went to see the King. On entering the royal presence,
he exchanged courtesies with the King, then sat down to one side. The
King said: 'We wish the Reverend Jotipala to manage our affairs. Do
not refuse. I will install you in your father's place and consecrate<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote539anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote539sym"><SUP>539</SUP></A></SUP>
you as Steward.' 'Very good, Lord', replied Jotipala.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
31. &quot;'So King Disampati appointed Jotipala as steward in his
father's place. And once installed, Jotipala carried out the business
his father had carried out, not doing any business his father had not
done. He accomplished all the tasks his father had accomplished, and
no others. And people said: 'This Brahmin is truly a steward! Indeed
he is a great steward!' And that is how the young Brahmin Jotipala
came to be known as the Great Steward.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
32. &quot;'And one day the Great Steward went to the group of six
nobles and said: 'King Disampati is aged, decrepit, [233] stricken
with age. His life is near its end and he cannot last much longer.
Who can tell how long people will live? When King Disampati dies, the
king-makers<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote540anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote540sym"><SUP>540</SUP></A></SUP>
are bound to anoint Prince Renu as King. You should go, gentlemen, to
Prince Renu and say: &quot;We are the beloved, dear and favoured
friends of the Lord Renu, sharing his joys and his sorrows. Our Lord
King Disampati is aged... When he dies, the king-makers are bound to
anoint the Lord Renu as King. If the Lord Renu should gain the
kingship, let him share it with us.&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
33. Very good, sir', said the six nobles, and they went to Prince
Renu and spoke to him as the Great Steward had proposed. 'Well,
gentlemen, who, apart from myself, ought to prosper but you? If,
gentlemen, I gain the kingship, I will share it with you.' [234]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
34. &quot;'In due course King Disampati died, and the king-makers
anointed Prince Renu King in his place. And having been made King,
Renu abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five senses. Then the
Great Steward went to the six nobles and said: 'Gentlemen, now King
Disampati is dead the Lord Renu, who has been anointed in his place,
has abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five senses. Who knows
what will come of this? The sense-pleasures are intoxicating. You
should go to him and say: &quot;King Disampati is dead and the Lord
Renu has been anointed King. Do you remember your word, Lord?&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'They did so, and the King said: 'Gentlemen, I remember my
word. Who is there who can divide this mighty realm of earth, so

Steward came to the King, exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down
to one side. Then the King said: 'My Lord Steward, go and divide this
mighty realm of earth, so broad in the north and so narrow like the
front of a cart in the south, into seven equal parts.' 'Very good,

And he thought: 'Now this good report is being spread about

not true. However, I have heard it said by aged and respectable

39. &quot;&quot;So the Great Steward went to King Renu and told him

nothing but dissatisfaction and weariness as he thought: 'I heard it

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
56. &quot;'Then the Great Steward went to the seven Brahmins and
their seven hundred advanced pupils, and said to them: 'Now, Your
Reverences, you must seek another teacher to teach you the mantras. I
mean to go forth from the household life into homelessness. After
what Brahma has told me about the stench of the world, which cannot
be easily overcome by one living the household life, I am going forth
into homelessness.' 'Reverend Steward, do not do so! There is little

'Do not say such things, gentlemen!</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Besides, who has greater power and profit than I have? I have been
like a king to kings, like Brahma to the Brahmins, like a deity to
householders, and I am giving all this up in order to go forth from
the household life into homelessness, as I have [249] explained.' 'If
the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into
homelessness, we will do likewise. Wherever you go, we will follow.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
57. &quot;'Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and
said: 'Whichever of you ladies wishes to may go back to her own
family and seek another husband. I mean to go forth into
homelessness...' 'You alone are the kinsman we could wish for, the
only husband we want. If the Reverend Steward goes forth into
homelessness, we will do likewise. Wherever you go, we will follow.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
58. &quot;'And so the Great Steward, at the end of the seven days,
shaved off his hair and beard, donned yellow robes and went forth
from the household life into homelessness. And with him went the
seven anointed Khattiya kings, the seven wealthy and distinguished
Brahmins with their seven hundred advanced pupils, his forty equal
wives, several thousand Khattiyas, several thousand Brahmins, several
thousand householders, even some harem-women.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'And so, followed by this company, the Great Steward wandered
through villages, towns and royal [250] cities. And whenever he came
to a village or town, he was like a king to kings, like Brahma to the
Brahmins, like a deity to householders. And in those days, whenever
anyone sneezed or stumbled, they used to say: 'Praise be to the Great
Steward! Praise be to the Minister of Seven!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
59. &quot;&quot;And the Great Steward dwelt suffusing one quarter
with a mind filled with loving-kindness, then a second, then a third
and a fourth quarter. He dwelt suffusing the whole world, up, down
and across, everywhere, all around, with a mind filled with
compassion,... with a mind filled with sympathetic joy,... with a
mind filled with equanimity,... free from hatred and ill-will. And
thus he taught his disciples the way to union with the Brahma-world.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
60. &quot;'And all those who had at that time been the Great
Steward's pupils and had fully mastered his teaching, were after
death at the breaking-up of the body reborn in a happy sphere, in the
Brahma-world. And those who had not fully mastered his teaching were
reborn either among the Paranimmita-Vasavatti devas, among the
Nimmanarati devas, among the Tusita devas, among the Yama devas,
[251] among the devas of the Thirty-Three Gods, or among the devas of
the Four Great Kings. And the very lowest realm that any of them
attained was that of the gandhabbas. Thus the going-forth of all
those people was not fruitless or barren, but productive of fruit and
profit.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
61. 'Do you remember this, Lord?&quot;I do, Pancasikha. At that time
I was the Brahmin, the Great Steward, and I taught those disciples
the path to union with the Brahma-world.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'However, Pancasikha, that holy life does not lead to disenchantment,
to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to superknowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana, but only to birth in the Brahma-world,
whereas my holy life leads unfailingly to disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to superknowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbana. That is the Noble Eightfold Path, namely
Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right
Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
62. 'And, Pancasikha, those of my disciples who have fully mastered
my teaching have by their own super-knowledge realised, [252] by the
destruction of the corruptions in this very life, the uncorrupted
freedom of heart and mind. And of those who have not fully mastered
it, some by the destruction of the five lower fetters will be reborn
spontaneously, attaining thence to Nibbana without returning to this
world; some by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of
greed, hatred and delusion will become Once-Returners, who will
return once more to this world before making an end of suffering; and
some by the destruction of three fetters will become Stream-Winners,
incapable of falling into states of woe, assured of enlightenment.
Thus the going-forth of all these people was not fruitless or barren,
but productive of fruit and profit.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Thus the Lord spoke, and Pancasikha of the gandhabbas was delighted
and rejoiced at the Lord's words. And, having saluted him, he passed
him by on the right and vanished from the spot.</P>

Sakkapanha Sutta: Sakka's Questions - A God Consults the Buddha 
</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[263] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote569anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote569sym"><SUP>569</SUP></A></SUP>
Once the Lord was staying in Magadha, to the east of Rajagaha, by a
Brahmin village called Ambasanda, to the north of the village on
Mount Vediya, in the Indasala Cave.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote570anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote570sym"><SUP>570</SUP></A></SUP>
And at that time Sakka, lord of the gods,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote571anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote571sym"><SUP>571</SUP></A></SUP>
felt a strong desire to see the Lord. And Sakka thought: 'Where is
the Blessed Lord, the fully-enlightened Buddha, now staying?' Then,
perceiving where the Lord was, Sakka said to the Thirty-Three Gods:
'Gentlemen, the Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha... in the Indasala
Cave. How would it be if we were to go and visit the Lord?' 'Very
good, Lord, and may good fortune go with you', replied the
Thirty-Three Gods.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.2. Then Sakka said to Pancasikha of the gandhabbas: [264] 'The
Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha ... in the Indasala Cave. I
propose to go to visit him.' 'Very good, Lord', said Pancasikha and,
taking his yellow beluva-wood lute,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote572anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote572sym"><SUP>572</SUP></A></SUP>
he followed in attendance on Sakka. And, just as swiftly as a strong
man might stretch forth his flexed arm, or flex it again, Sakka,
surrounded by the Thirty-Three Gods and attended by Pancasikha,
vanished from the heaven of the Thirty-Three and appeared in
Magadha...on Mount Vediya.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.3. Then a tremendous light shone over Mount Vediya, illuminating
the village of Ambasanda - so great was the power of the gods - so
that in the surrounding villages they were saying: 'Look, Mount
Vediya is on fire today - it's burning - it's in flames! What is the
matter, that Mount Vediya and Ambasanda are lit up like this?' and
they y were so terrified that their hair stood on end.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.4. Then Sakka said: 'Pancasikha, [265] it is hard for the likes of
us to get near the Tathagatas when they are enjoying the bliss of
meditation,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote573anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote573sym"><SUP>573</SUP></A></SUP>
and therefore withdrawn. But if you, Pancasikha, were first to
attract<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote574anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote574sym"><SUP>574</SUP></A></SUP>
the ear of the Blessed Lord, then we might afterwards be able to
approach and see the Blessed Lord, the fully-enlightened Buddha.'
'Very good, Lord', said Pancasikha and, taking his yellow beluva-wood
lute, he approached the Indasala Cave. Thinking: 'As far as this is
neither too far nor too near to the Lord, and he will hear my voice',
he stood to one side. Then, to the strains of his lute, he sang these
verses extolling the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Arahants, and love:<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote575anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote575sym"><SUP>575</SUP></A></SUP></P>

1.6. When he heard this, the Lord said: 'Pancasikha, the sound of
your strings blends so well with your song, and your song with the
strings, that neither prevails excessively over the other.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote580anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote580sym"><SUP>580</SUP></A></SUP>
When did you compose these verses on the Buddha, the Dhamma, the
Arahants, and love?' 'Lord, it was when the Blessed Lord was staying
on the bank of the River Neranjara, under the goatherd's banyan tree
[268] prior to his enlightenment. At that time I fell in love with
the lady Bhadda, bright as the sun, the daughter of King Timbaru of
the gandhabbas. But the lady was in love with somebody else. It was
Sikhaddi, the son of Matali the charioteer, whom she favoured. And
when I found that I could not win the lady by any manner of means, I
took my yellow beluva-wood lute and went to the home of King Timbaru
of the gandhabbas, and there I sang these verses:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.7. (Verses as 5). 'And, Lord, having heard the verses the lady
Bhadda Suriyavaccasa said to me: &quot;Sir, I have not personally
seen that Blessed Lord, though I heard of him when I went to the
Sudhamma Hall of the Thirty-Three Gods to dance. And since, sir, you
praise that Blessed Lord so highly, let us meet today.&quot; [269]
And so, Lord, I met the lady, not then but later.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.8. Then Sakka thought: 'Pancasikha and the Lord are in friendly
conversation', so he called to Pancasikha: 'My dear Pancasikha,
salute the Blessed Lord from me, saying: &quot;Lord, Sakka, king of
the gods, together with his ministers and followers, pays homage at
the feet of the Blessed Lord.&quot;' 'Very good, Lord', said
Pancasikha, and did so.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Pancasikha, may Sakka, king of the gods, his ministers and followers
be happy, for they all desire happiness: devas, humans, asuras,
nagas, gandhabbas, and whatever other groups of beings there are!'
for that is the way the Tathagatas greet such mighty beings. After
this greeting, Sakka entered the Indasala Cave, saluted the Lord, and
stood to one side, and the Thirty-Three Gods, with Pancasikha, did
the same.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.9. Then in the Indasala Cave the rough passages became smooth, the
narrow parts became wide, and in the pitch-dark cavern it became
bright, owing to the [270] power of the devas. Then the Lord said to
Sakka: 'It is wonderful, it is marvellous that the Venerable Kosiya,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote581anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote581sym"><SUP>581</SUP></A></SUP>
with so much, so many things to do, should come here!' 'Lord, I have
long wished to visit the Blessed Lord, but I have always been so busy
on behalf of the Thirty-Three that I was unable to come. Once the
Blessed Lord was staying at Savatthi in the Salala hut, and I went to
Savatthi to see the Lord.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.10. 'At that time the Blessed Lord was seated in some form of
meditation, and King Vessavana's wife Bhunjati was waiting on him,
venerating him with palms together. I said to her: &quot;Lady, please
salute the Blessed Lord for me and say: 'Sakka, the king of the gods,
with his ministers and followers, pays homage at the Lord's feet'.
But she said: &quot;Sir, it is not the right time to see the Blessed
Lord, he is in retreat.&quot; [271] &quot;Well then, lady, when the
Blessed Lord rises from his meditation, please tell him what I have
said.&quot; Lord, did the lady salute you on my behalf, and does the
Lord remember what she said?' 'She did salute me, King of the Gods,
and I remember what she said. I also remember that it was the sound
of Your Reverence's chariot-wheels that roused me from my
meditation.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote582anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote582sym"><SUP>582</SUP></A></SUP></P>

1.11. 'Lord, those gods who arose in the heaven of the ThirtyThree
before I did have told me and assured me that whenever a Tathagata, a
fully-enlightened Arahant Buddha arises in the world, the ranks of
devas increase, and those of the asuras decline in numbers. In fact I
have witnessed this myself. There was, Lord, right here in
Kapilavatthu a Sakyan girl called Gopika who had faith in the Buddha,
the Dhamma and the Sangha, and who observed the precepts
scrupulously. She rejected the status of a woman and developed the
thought of becoming a man. Then, after her death, at the breaking-up
of the body, she went to a happy destination, being reborn in a
heaven-state among the Thirty-Three Gods, as one of our sons,
becoming known as Gopaka the devas' son.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote583anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote583sym"><SUP>583</SUP></A></SUP>
Also, there were three monks who, having observed the holy life under
the Blessed Lord, had been reborn in the inferior condition of
gandhabbas. They lived indulging in the pleasures of the five senses,
as our attendants and servants. At this, Gopaka [272] rebuked them,
saying: &quot;What were you about, sirs, that you did not listen to
the Blessed Lord's teaching? I was a woman who had faith in the
Buddha...1 rejected the status of a woman... and was reborn among the
Thirty-Three Gods and am known as Gopaka the devas' son. But you,
after having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord, have been
reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas! It is a sorry sight
for us to see our fellows in the Dhamma reborn in the inferior
condition of gandhabbas!&quot; And being thus rebuked, two of those
devas immediately developed mindfulness,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote584anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote584sym"><SUP>584</SUP></A></SUP>
and so attained to the Realm of the Retinue of Brahma.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote585anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote585sym"><SUP>585</SUP></A></SUP>
But one of them remained addicted to sensual pleasures.</P>

whatever other kinds there may be - whereby, although they wish to
live without hate, harming, hostility or malignity, and in peace,
they yet live in hate, harming one another, hostile and malign?' This

Lord, whatever object perceived by the eye, if its pursuit leads to
the increase of unwholesome factors and the decrease of wholesome
ones, that is not to be sought after; if its pursuit leads to the
decrease of unwholesome factors and the increase of wholesome ones,
such an object is [282] to be sought after. And the same applies to

up of many and various elements. Such being the case, beings adhere

at length, and thus removed the dart of doubt and uncertainty from

replied that I was Sakka, ruler of the gods, and they asked me what

heard it and practised it. But they were very pleased with even that
much, and they said: &quot;We have seen Sakka, the ruler of the gods,
and he has answered the questions we put to him!&quot; And they
became my pupils instead of my becoming theirs. But I, Lord, am a

And at that time Prince Payasi was living at Setavya, a populous

him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal
powers.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote702anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote702sym"><SUP>702</SUP></A></SUP></P>

2. And Prince Payasi developed the following evil opinion: 'There is

fruit or result [317] of good or evil deeds.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote703anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote703sym"><SUP>703</SUP></A></SUP>
Meanwhile, the Brahmins and householders of Setavya heard the news:
'The ascetic Kumara-Kassapa, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is
touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred
monks; he has arrived at Setavya and is staying to the north of
Setavya in the Sirhsapa Forest; and concerning the Reverend Kassapa a
good report has been spread about: &quot;He is learned, experienced,
wise, well-informed, a fine speaker, able to give good replies,
venerable, an Arahant.&quot; And it is good to see such Arahants.'

'Sir, it is the ascetic KumaraKassapa, a disciple of the ascetic
Gotama,... and concerning him a good report has been spread about
...That is why they are going to see him.' 'Well then, steward, you
go to the Brahmins and householders of Setavya and say: &quot;Gentlemen,
Prince Payasi says: 'Please wait, the Prince will come to see the

has been teaching these foolish and inexperienced Brahmins and
householders of Setavya that there is another world, that there are

had fallen head first into a cesspit, and you were to say to your

say: &quot;Very good&quot;, and do so. Then you would tell them to

to give him a triple shampoo with yellow loam. Then you would tell
them to anoint his body with oil and then to clean him three times

beard, and to adorn him with fine garlands, ointments and clothes.

delicate baby boy lying abandoned on his back. At the sight he
thought: &quot;It would not be right for me to look on and let a
human being die. I had better take this child to my hermitage, take
care of him, feed him and bring him up.&quot; So he did so. When the
boy was ten or twelve, the hermit had some business to do in the

go out. Then he thought: &quot;Father said: '...here is an axe ... so

to that district, and came to a village street. [350] And there they
saw a pile of hemp that had been thrown away, and one said: &quot;Here's
some hemp. You make a bundle, I'll make a bundle, and we'll both
carry it off.&quot; The other agreed, and they did so. Then, coming
to another village street, they found some hemp-thread, and one said:

Let's each throw away our bundle of hemp, and we'll go on with a load
of hemp-thread each.&quot; &quot;I've brought this bundle of hemp a

1.15. 'Once, Bhaggava, I was staying at Vesali in the Gabled Hall in
the Great Forest. And at that time there was a naked ascetic living
in Vesali called Patikaputta, who enjoyed great gains and fame in the
Vajjian capital. And he made this declaration in the assembly of
Vesali: &quot;The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom, and I
make the same claim. It is right that a man of wisdom should show it
by performing miracles. If the ascetic Gotama will come half-way to
meet me, I will do likewise. Then we could both work miracles, and if
the ascetic Gotama performs one miracle, I will perform two. If he
performs two, I will perform [13] four. And if he performs four, I
will perform eight. However many miracles the ascetic Gotama
performs, I will perform twice as many!&quot;</P>

I have also been told by a deva. [15] For Ajita, the general of the
Licchavis, died the other day and has been reborn in the company of
the Thirty-Three Gods. He came to see me and told me: 'Lord,
Patikaputta the naked ascetic is an impudent liar! He declared in the
Vajjian capital: &quot;Ajita, the general of the Licchavis, has been
reborn in the great hell!&quot; But I have not been reborn in the
great hell, but in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods. He is an
impudent liar...' Thus, Sunakkhatta, I know what I have said by my

I will go into Vesali for alms. On my return, after I have eaten, I
will go for my midday rest to Patikaputta's park. You may tell him

accordingly and emerging in the evening, he surveyed the four
quarters, and then thought: 'Now I will roar a lion's roar three
times', - and he gave out the howl of his kind, a jackal howl. For
what has the wretched howl of a jackal in common with a lion's roar?

[36] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying in Rajagaha at

And one morning early, the householder Sandhana came to Rajagaha in

see the Blessed Lord, he is in retreat; it is not the proper time to
see the meditating monks, they are in retreat. Perhaps I should go to

called his followers to order, saying: 'Be quiet, gentlemen, don't
make a noise, gentlemen! The householder Sandhana, a follower of the
ascetic Gotama, is approaching. He is one of the number of
white-robed householder followers of the ascetic Gotama in Rajagaha.
And these good folk are fond of quiet, they are taught to be quiet
and speak in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is quiet,
he will most likely want to come and visit us.' At this the wanderers
fell silent.</P>

4. Then Sandhana approached Nigrodha and exchanged courtesies with
him, and then sat down to one side. Then he said: 'Reverend sirs, the
way the wanderers of another faith conduct themselves when they come
together is one thing: [381 they make a great clamour and indulge in
all manner of unedifying conversation.. The Blessed Lord's way is
different: he seeks a lodging in the forest, in the depths of the
jungle, free from noise, with little sound, far from the madding
crowd, undisturbed by men, well fitted for seclusion.'</P>

5. Then Nigrodha replied: 'Well now, householder, do you know whom
the ascetic Gotama talks to? Whom does he converse with? From whom
does he get his lucidity of wisdom? The ascetic Gotama's wisdom is
destroyed by the solitary life, he is unused to assemblies, he is no
good at conversation, he is right out of touch. Just as bison<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote752anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote752sym"><SUP>752</SUP></A></SUP>

reported the fact to the King. Then King Dalhanemi sent for his
eldest son, the crown prince, and said: &quot;My son, the sacred
Wheel-Treasure has slipped from its position. And I have heard say
that when this happens to a wheelturning monarch, he has not much
longer to live. I have had my fill [60] of human pleasures, now is
the time to seek heavenly pleasures. You, my son, take over control
of this ocean-bounded land. I will shave off my hair and beard, don
yellow robes, and go forth from the household life into
homelessness.&quot; And, having installed his eldest son in due form
as king, King Dalhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, donned yellow
robes, and went forth from the household life into homelessness. And,
seven days after the royal sage had gone forth, the sacred
Wheel-Treasure vanished.</P>

Then other beings, taking their cue from that one, also tasted the
stuff with their fingers. They too were taken with the flavour, and

pieces of the stuff in order to eat it. And [86] the result of this
was that their self-luminance disappeared. And as a result of the

continued to feed on the fungus, so their bodies became coarser

another one came to him and said: &quot;Come on, let's go

wordy warfare: 'You don't understand this doctrine and discipline - I
do!' 'How could you understand this doctrine and discipline?&quot;Your
way is all wrong - mine is right!' 'I am consistent - you areri t!'
'You said last what you should have said first, and you said first
what you should have said last!' 'What you took so long to think up
has been refuted!' 'Your argument has been overthrown, you're
defeated!' 'Go on, save your doctrine - get out of that if you can!'
You would have thought the Niganthas, Nataputta's disciples, were
bent on killing each other. Even the white-robed lay [118] followers
were disgusted, displeased and repelled when they saw that their
doctrine and discipline was so ill-proclaimed, so unedifyingly
displayed, and so ineffectual in calming the passions, having been
proclaimed by one not fully enlightened, and now with its support

detached from unwholesome mental states, enters and remains in the
first jhana, which is with thinking and pondering, born of
detachment, filled with delight and happiness. And with the subsiding
of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness
of mind, he enters and remains in the second jhana, which is without
thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight
and happiness. Again, with the fading of delight, remaining
imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experiences in himself
that joy of which the Noble Ones say: &quot;Happy is he who dwells
with equanimity and mindfulness&quot;, he enters and remains in the
third jhana. Again, having given up pleasure [132] and pain, and with
the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters and

purified by equanimity and mindfulness.</P>

given to these four forms of pleasure-seeking - how many fruits, how
many benefits can they expect?&quot; And you should reply: &quot;They
can expect four fruits, four benefits. What are they? The first is
when a monk by the destruction of three fetters has become a
Stream-Winner, no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds, firmly
established, destined for full enlightenment; the second is when a
monk by the complete destruction of three fetters and the reduction
of greed, hatred and delusion, has become a Once-Returner, and having
returned once more to this world, will put an end to suffering; the
third is when a monk, by the complete destruction of the five lower
fetters, has been spontaneously reborn, and there will reach Nibbana
without returning from that world. The fourth is when a monk, by the
destruction of the corruptions in this very life has, by his own
knowledge and realisation, attained to Arahantship, to the
deliverance of heart and through wisdom. Such are the four fruits and
the four benefits that one given to these four forms of
pleasure-seeking can expect.&quot;</P>

or an iron post which is deep-based, well-planted and unshakeable,
immovable are these doctrines he has taught. And any monk who is an
Arahant, whose corruptions are destroyed, who has lived the life,
done what was to be done, laid down the burden, gained the true goal,
who has completely destroyed the fetter of becoming, and is liberated
by supreme insight, is incapable of doing nine things: (1) He is
incapable of deliberately taking the life of a living being; (2) he
is incapable of taking what is not given so as to constitute theft;
(3) he is incapable of sexual intercourse; (4) he is incapable of
telling a deliberate lie; (5) he is incapable of storing up goods for
sensual indulgence as he did formerly in the household life; (6) he

acting wrongly through folly; (9) he is incapable of acting wrongly

you got up early to [181] pay homage to the different directions?'
'Lord, my father, when he was dying, told me to do so. And so, Lord,
out of respect for my father's words, which I revere, honour and hold
sacred, I have got up thus early to pay homage in this way to the six
directions.' 'But, householder's son, that is not the right way to
pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline.'
'Well, Lord, how should one pay homage to the six directions
according to the Ariyan discipline? It would be good if the Blessed
Lord were to teach me the proper way to pay homage to the six
directions according to the Ariyan discipline.' 'Then listen
carefully, pay attention, and I will speak.' 'Yes, Lord', said

taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from lying speech,
and from strong drink and sloth-producing drugs. But the majority of
the yakkhas do not refrain from these things, and to do so is
distasteful and unpleasant to them. Now, Lord, there are disciples of
the Blessed Lord who dwell in remote forest glades, where there is
little noise or shouting, far from the madding crowd, hidden from

[207] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring in the Malla
country with a large company of about five hundred monks. Arrived at
Pava, the Mallas' capital, he stayed in the mango-grove of Cunda the
smith.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1002anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1002sym"><SUP>1002</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.2. Now at that time a new meeting-hall of the Mallas of Pava,
called Ubbhataka,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1003anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1003sym"><SUP>1003</SUP></A></SUP>
had recently been built, and it had not yet been occupied by any
ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. Hearing that the
Lord was staying in Cunda's mango-grove, the Mallas of Pava went to
see him. Having saluted him, they sat down to one side and said:
'Lord, the Mallas of Pava have recently erected a new meetinghall
called Ubbhataka, and it has not yet been occupied by any ascetic or
Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. [208] May the Blessed Lord be
the first to use it! Should he do so, that would be for the lasting
good and happiness of the Mallas of Pava.' And the Lord consented by
silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.3. Noting his assent, the Mallas rose, saluted him, passed out to
his right and went to the meeting-hall. They spread mats all round,
arranged seats, put out a water-pot and an oillamp, and then,
returning to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side and reported
what they had done, saying: 'Whenever the Blessed Lord is ready.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.4. Then the Lord dressed, took his robe and bowl, and went to the
meeting-hall with his monks. There he washed his feet, entered the
hall and sat down against the central pillar, facing east. The monks,
having washed their feet, entered the hall and sat down along the
western wall facing east, [2091 with the Lord in front of them. The
Pava Mallas washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat down along
the eastern wall facing west, with the Lord in front of them. Then
the</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Lord spoke to the Mallas on Dhamma till far into the night,
instructing, inspiring, firing and delighting them. Then he dismissed
them, saying: 'Vasetthas,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1004anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1004sym"><SUP>1004</SUP></A></SUP>
the night has passed away.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1005anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1005sym"><SUP>1005</SUP></A></SUP>
Now do as you think fit.' 'Very good, Lord', replied the Mallas. And
they got up, saluted the Lord, and went out, passing him by on the
right.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.5. As soon as the Mallas had gone the Lord, surveying the monks
sitting silently all about, said to the Venerable Sariputta: 'The
monks are free from sloth-and-torpor,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1006anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1006sym"><SUP>1006</SUP></A></SUP>
Sariputta. You think of a discourse on Dhamma to give to them. My
back aches, I want to stretch it.' 'Very good, Lord', replied
Sariputta. Then the Lord, having folded his robe in four, lay down on
his right side in the lion-posture,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1007anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1007sym"><SUP>1007</SUP></A></SUP>

1.6. Now at that time the Nigantha Nataputta [210] had just died at
Pava. And at his death the Niganthas were split into two parties,
quarrelling and disputing... (as Sutta 29, verse 1). You would have
thought they were bent on killing each other. Even the white-robed
lay followers were disgusted when they saw that their doctrine and
discipline was so ill-proclaimed,... having been proclaimed by one
not fully-enlightened and now with its support gone, without an
arbiter.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.7. And the Venerable Sariputta addressed the monks, referring to
this situation, and said: 'So ill-proclaimed was their teaching and
discipline, so unedifyingly displayed, and so ineffectual in calming
the passions, having been proclaimed by one who was not fully
enlightened. [211] But, friends, this Dhamma has been well proclaimed
