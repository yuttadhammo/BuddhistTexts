Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, in Jetavana, Anathapindika's
park. 'Monks!' he said, and the monks replied: 'Lord.' The Lord said:
'There are, monks, these thirty-two marks peculiar to a Great Man,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote930anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote930sym"><SUP>930</SUP></A></SUP>
and for that Great Man who possesses them, only two careers are open.
If he lives the household life, he will become a ruler, a
wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four
quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is
possessed of the seven treasures. These are: the Wheel Treasure, the
Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman
Treasure, the Householder Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor
Treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic
stature, conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered
this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law. But if he goes
forth from the household life into homelessness, he will become an
Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, who has drawn back the veil from
the world.</P>

outstretched arms, and conversely. (20) His bust is evenly rounded.
(21) He has a perfect sense of taste.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote938anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote938sym"><SUP>938</SUP></A></SUP>

that kamma, heaping it up, lavishly and abundantly, at the
breaking-up of the body after death he was reborn in a happy state,

ill-intent. That is his benefit as a ruler. And if he goes forth into
