Udumbarika-Sianada Sutta: The Great Lion's Roar to the Udumbarikans</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[36] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying in Rajagaha at
the Vultures' Peak. And at that time the wanderer Nigrodha<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote749anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote749sym"><SUP>749</SUP></A></SUP>
was staying at the Udumbarika lodging<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote750anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote750sym"><SUP>750</SUP></A></SUP>
for wanderers, with a large company of some three thousand wanderers.
And one morning early, the householder Sandhana came to Rajagaha in
order to see the Lord. Then he thought: 'It is not the proper time to
see the Blessed Lord, he is in retreat; it is not the proper time to
see the meditating monks, they are in retreat. Perhaps I should go to
the Udumbarika lodging for wanderers and call on Nigrodha.' And he
did so.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. And just then Nigrodha was sitting in the midst of a large crowd
of wanderers who were all shouting and screaming and making a great
clamour, and indulging in various kinds of unedifying conversation<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote751anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote751sym"><SUP>751</SUP></A></SUP>
about kings, [37] robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, war, food,
drink, clothes, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, carriages,
villages, towns and cities, countries, women, heroes, street- and
well-gossip, talk of the departed, desultory chat, speculation about
land and sea, talk of being and non-being.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Then Nigrodha saw Sandhana approaching from a distance, and he
called his followers to order, saying: 'Be quiet, gentlemen, don't
make a noise, gentlemen! The householder Sandhana, a follower of the
ascetic Gotama, is approaching. He is one of the number of
white-robed householder followers of the ascetic Gotama in Rajagaha.
And these good folk are fond of quiet, they are taught to be quiet
and speak in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is quiet,
he will most likely want to come and visit us.' At this the wanderers
fell silent.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. Then Sandhana approached Nigrodha and exchanged courtesies with
him, and then sat down to one side. Then he said: 'Reverend sirs, the
way the wanderers of another faith conduct themselves when they come
together is one thing: [381 they make a great clamour and indulge in
all manner of unedifying conversation.. The Blessed Lord's way is
different: he seeks a lodging in the forest, in the depths of the
jungle, free from noise, with little sound, far from the madding
crowd, undisturbed by men, well fitted for seclusion.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. Then Nigrodha replied: 'Well now, householder, do you know whom
the ascetic Gotama talks to? Whom does he converse with? From whom
does he get his lucidity of wisdom? The ascetic Gotama's wisdom is
destroyed by the solitary life, he is unused to assemblies, he is no
good at conversation, he is right out of touch. Just as bison<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote752anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote752sym"><SUP>752</SUP></A></SUP>
circling around keep to the fringes, so it is with the ascetic
Gotama. In fact, householder, if the ascetic Gotama were to come to
this assembly, we would baffle him with a single question, we would
knock him over like an empty pot.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. Now the Lord, with his divine-ear-faculty, purified and surpassing
human range, heard this exchange between Sandhana and Nigrodha. And,
descending from the Vultures' Peak, he came to the Peacocks' Feeding
Ground beside the Sumagadha Tank, and [391 walked up and down there
in the open air. Then Nigrodha caught sight of him, and he called his
company to order, saying: 'Gentlemen, he quiet, be less noisy! The
ascetic Gotama is walking up and down beside the Sumagadha Tank. He
is fond of quiet, he speaks in praise of quiet. If he sees that this
company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us. If
he does so, we will put this question to him: &quot;Lord, what is
this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and
which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it
recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy
life?&quot;' At this, the wanderers were silent.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. Then the Lord approached Nigrodha, and Nigrodha said: 'Come,
Blessed Lord, welcome, Blessed Lord! At last the Blessed Lord has
gone out of his way to come here. Be seated, Lord, a seat is
prepared.' The Lord sat down on the prepared seat, and Nigrodha took
a low stool and sat down to one side. Then the Lord said to him:
'Nigrodha, what was the subject of your conversation just now? What
talk have I interrupted?' Nigrodha replied: 'Lord, we saw the Blessed
Lord walking up and down at the Peacocks' Feeding Ground by the
Sumagadha Tank, [40] and we thought: &quot;If the ascetic Gotama were
to come here we could ask him this question: Lord, what is this
doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which
those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it
recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy
life?&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Nigrodha, it is hard for you, holding different views, being of
different inclinations and subject to different influences, following
a different teacher, to understand the doctrine which I teach my
disciples ... Come on then, Nigrodha, ask me about your own teaching,
about your extreme austerity. How are the conditions of austerity and
self-mortification fulfilled, and how are they not fulfilled?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise, exclaiming:
'It is wonderful, it is marvellous how great are the powers of the
ascetic Gotama in holding back with his own theories and in inviting
others to discuss theirs!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. Silencing them, Nigrodha said: 'Lord, we teach the higher
austerities, we regard them as essential, we adhere to them. Such
being the case, what constitutes their fulfilment or nonfulfilment?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Suppose, Nigrodha, a self-mortifier goes naked, uses no polite
restraints, licks his hands, does not come or stand still when
requested. [41] He does not accept food out of the pot or pan ... (as
Sutta 8, verse 14). He wears coarse hemp or mixed material, shrouds
from corpses, rags from the dust-heap ... He is a plucker-out of hair
and beard, devoted [42] to this practice; he is a covered-thorn man,
making his bed on them, sleeping alone in a garment of wet mud,
living in the open air, accepting whatever seat is offered, one who
drinks no water and is addicted to the practice, or he dwells intent
on the practice of going to bathe three times before evening. What do
you think, Nigrodha, is the higher austerity thereby fulfilled, or
not?' 'Indeed, Lord, it is fulfilled.' 'But, Nigrodha, I maintain
that this higher austerity can be faulted in various ways.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9. 'In what way, Lord, do you maintain that it can be faulted?' 'Take
the case, Nigrodha, of a self-mortifier who practises a certain
austerity. As a result, he is pleased and satisfied at having
attained his end. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. Or else
in so doing he elevates himself and disparages others. And this is a
fault in that self-mortifier. Or else he has become intoxicated with
conceit, infatuated and therefore careless. And this [43] is a fault
in that self-mortifier.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
10. 'Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity, and this
brings him gains, honours and fame. As a result, he is pleased and
satisfied at having attained his end ...Or else he elevates himself
and disparages others ... Or else he becomes intoxicated with
conceit, infatuated and therefore careless. And this is a fault in
that self-mortifier. Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain
austerity, and he divides his food into two heaps, saying: &quot;This
suits me, that doesn't suit me!&quot; And what does not suit him he
eagerly rejects, while what suits him he eats up greedily, recklessly
and passionately, not seeing the peril, with no thought for the
consequences. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. [44.]
Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity for the sake of
gains, honours and fame, thinking: &quot;Kings and their ministers
will honour me, Khattiyas and Brahmins and householders, and
religious teachers.&quot; And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</P>

things! Whether propagated from roots, from stems, from joings, from
cuttings or fifthly from seeds,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote753anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote753sym"><SUP>753</SUP></A></SUP>
he chews them all up with that thunderbolt of a jaw of his, and they
call him an ascetic!&quot; And this is a fault in that
self-mortifier. Or he sees another ascetic or Brahmin being made much
of by families, being honoured and respected and worshipped, and he
thinks: &quot;They make much of that rich-liver, they honour him,
respect him and worship him, whereas I who am a real ascetic and
self-mortifier get no such treatment!&quot; Thus he is envious and
jealous because of those householders. And this is a fault in that
self-mortifier.</P>

'Again, a self-mortifier sits in a prominent position. And this is a

among the families, as if to say: &quot;See, this is my way of
renunciation!&quot; And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. [45]
Or he behaves in an underhand way. On being asked: &quot;Do you
approve of this?&quot; although he does not approve he says: &quot;I
do&quot;, or although he does approve he says: &quot;I do not.&quot;
In this way he becomes a conscious liar. And this is a fault in that
self-mortifier.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
12. 'Again, a self-mortifier, when the Tathagata or a disciple of the
Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his
assent, withholds that assent. And this is a fault in that
self-mortifier. Or he is angry and bad-tempered. And this is a fault
in that self-mortifier. Or he is mean and spiteful, envious and
jealous, crafty and deceitful, obstinate and proud, with evil desires
and under their sway, with wrong views and given to extremist
opinions; he is tainted with worldliness, holding on firmly,
unwilling to give up. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.
What do you think, Nigrodha? Are these things faults in the higher
austerity, or not?' 'Certainly they are, Lord. It could happen that a
single self-mortifier was possessed of all these faults, not to speak
of just one or the other.'</P>
