Sangiti Sutta: The Chanting Together</H2>

[207] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring in the Malla
country with a large company of about five hundred monks. Arrived at
Pava, the Mallas' capital, he stayed in the mango-grove of Cunda the
smith.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1002anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1002sym"><SUP>1002</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.2. Now at that time a new meeting-hall of the Mallas of Pava,
called Ubbhataka,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1003anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1003sym"><SUP>1003</SUP></A></SUP>
had recently been built, and it had not yet been occupied by any
ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. Hearing that the
Lord was staying in Cunda's mango-grove, the Mallas of Pava went to
see him. Having saluted him, they sat down to one side and said:
'Lord, the Mallas of Pava have recently erected a new meetinghall
called Ubbhataka, and it has not yet been occupied by any ascetic or
Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. [208] May the Blessed Lord be
the first to use it! Should he do so, that would be for the lasting
good and happiness of the Mallas of Pava.' And the Lord consented by
silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.3. Noting his assent, the Mallas rose, saluted him, passed out to
his right and went to the meeting-hall. They spread mats all round,
arranged seats, put out a water-pot and an oillamp, and then,
returning to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side and reported
what they had done, saying: 'Whenever the Blessed Lord is ready.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.4. Then the Lord dressed, took his robe and bowl, and went to the
meeting-hall with his monks. There he washed his feet, entered the
hall and sat down against the central pillar, facing east. The monks,
having washed their feet, entered the hall and sat down along the
western wall facing east, [2091 with the Lord in front of them. The
Pava Mallas washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat down along
the eastern wall facing west, with the Lord in front of them. Then
the</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Lord spoke to the Mallas on Dhamma till far into the night,
instructing, inspiring, firing and delighting them. Then he dismissed
them, saying: 'Vasetthas,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1004anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1004sym"><SUP>1004</SUP></A></SUP>
the night has passed away.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1005anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1005sym"><SUP>1005</SUP></A></SUP>
Now do as you think fit.' 'Very good, Lord', replied the Mallas. And
they got up, saluted the Lord, and went out, passing him by on the
right.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.5. As soon as the Mallas had gone the Lord, surveying the monks
sitting silently all about, said to the Venerable Sariputta: 'The
monks are free from sloth-and-torpor,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1006anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1006sym"><SUP>1006</SUP></A></SUP>
Sariputta. You think of a discourse on Dhamma to give to them. My
back aches, I want to stretch it.' 'Very good, Lord', replied
Sariputta. Then the Lord, having folded his robe in four, lay down on
his right side in the lion-posture,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1007anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1007sym"><SUP>1007</SUP></A></SUP>
with one foot on the other, mindful and clearly aware, and bearing in
mind the time to arise.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.6. Now at that time the Nigantha Nataputta [210] had just died at
Pava. And at his death the Niganthas were split into two parties,
quarrelling and disputing... (as Sutta 29, verse 1). You would have
thought they were bent on killing each other. Even the white-robed
lay followers were disgusted when they saw that their doctrine and
discipline was so ill-proclaimed,... having been proclaimed by one
not fully-enlightened and now with its support gone, without an
arbiter.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.7. And the Venerable Sariputta addressed the monks, referring to
this situation, and said: 'So ill-proclaimed was their teaching and
discipline, so unedifyingly displayed, and so ineffectual in calming
the passions, having been proclaimed by one who was not fully
enlightened. [211] But, friends, this Dhamma has been well proclaimed
by the Lord, the fullyenlightened One. And so we should all recite it
together<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1008anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1008sym"><SUP>1008</SUP></A></SUP>
without disagreement, so that this holy life may be enduring and
established for a long time, thus to be for the welfare and happiness
of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit,
welfare and happiness of devas and humans. And what is this Dhamma
that has been well proclaimed by the Lord...?</P>

(b) abandoning (pahana-p.), (c) development (bhavanap.), (d)
preservation (anurakkhana-p.). What is (a) the effort of restraint?
Here, a monk, on seeing an object with the eye, does not grasp at the
whole or its details, striving to restrain [226] what might cause
evil, unwholesome states, such as hankering or sorrow, to flood in on
him. Thus he watches over the sense of sight and guards it (similarly
with sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, thoughts). What is
(b) the effort of abandoning? Here, a monk does not assent to a
thought of lust, of hatred, of cruelty that has arisen, but abandons
it, dispels it, destroys it, makes it disappear. What is (c) the
effort of development? Here, a monk develops the enlightenmentfactor
of mindfulness, based on solitude, detachment, extinction,leading to
maturity of surrender (vossagga-parindmim); he develops the
enlightenment-factor of investigation of states,... of energy,... of
delight,... of tranquillity,... of concentration,... of equanimity,
based on solitude, detachment, extinction, leading to maturity of
surrender. What is (d) the effort of preservation? Here, a monk keeps
firmly in his mind a favourable object of concentration which has
arisen, such as a skeleton, or a corpse that is full of worms,
blue-black, full of holes, bloated.</P>
