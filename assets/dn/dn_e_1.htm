[1] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>
Once the Lord was travelling along the main road between Rajagaha and
Nalanda<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
with a large company of some five hundred monks. And the wanderer
Suppiya was also travelling on that road with his pupil the youth
Brahmadatta. And Suppiya<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>
was finding fault in all sorts of ways with the Buddha, the Dhamma
and the Sangha, whereas his pupil Brahmadatta was speaking in various
ways in their praise. And so these two, teacher and pupil, directly
opposing each other's arguments, followed close behind the Lord and
his order of monks.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.2. Then the Lord stopped for one night with his monks at the royal
park of Ambalatthika. And Suppiya too stopped there for the night
with his pupil Brahmadatta. And Suppiya went on abusing the Buddha,
the Dhamma and the Sangha, while his [2] pupil Brahmadatta defended
them. And thus disputing, they followed close behind the Buddha and
his order of monks.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.3. Now in the early morning a number of monks, having got up,
gathered together and sat in the Round Pavilion, and this was the
trend of their talk: 'It is wonderful, friends, it is marvellous how
the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fullyenlightened Buddha knows,
sees and clearly distinguishes the different inclinations of beings!
For here is the wanderer Suhpiya finding fault in all sorts of ways
with the Buddha, the Mamma and the Sangha, while his pupil
Brahmadatta in various ways defends them. And, still disputing, they
follow donely behind the Blessed Lord and his order of monks.'</P>

1.4. Then the Lord, being aware of what those monks were saying, went
to the Round Pavilion and sat down on the prepared seat. Then he
said: 'Monks, what was the subject of your conversation just now?
What talk have I interrupted?' And they told him.</P>

1.5. 'Monks, if anyone should speak in disparagement of me, of the
Dhamma or of the Sangha,[3] you should not be angry, resentful or
upset on that account. If you were to be angry or displeased at such
disparagement, that would only be a hindrance to you. For if others
disparage me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, and you are angry or
displeased, can you recognise whether what they say is right or not?'
'No, Lord.' 'If others disparage me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, then
you must explain what is incorrect as being incorrect, saying: &quot;That
is incorrect, that is false, that is not our way,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>

happy or elated. If you were to be pleased, happy or elated at such
praise, that would only be a hindrance to you. If others praise me,

true, saying: &quot;That is correct, that is right, that is our way,
