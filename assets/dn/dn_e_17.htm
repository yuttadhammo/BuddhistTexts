1.2. The Venerable Ananda came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to
one side and said: 'Lord, may the Blessed Lord not pass away in this
miserable little town of wattle-anddaub, right in the jungle in the

Rajagaha, Savatthi, Saketa, Kosambi or Varanasi. In those places
there are wealthy Khattiyas, Brahmins and householders who are

was a wheelturning monarch, a rightful and righteous king, who had
conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his
realm. [170] And this King Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara,
under the name of Kusavati, for his capital. And it was twelve
yojanas long from east to west, and seven yojanas wide from north to
south. Kusavati was rich, prosperous and well-populated, crowded with
people and well-stocked with food. Just as the deva-city of
Alakamanda is rich... (as Sutta 16, verse 5.18), so was the royal
city of Kusavati. And the city of Kusavati was never free of ten
sounds by day or night: the sound of elephants, horses, carriages,
kettle-drums, side-drums, lutes, singing, cymbals and gongs, with
cries of &quot;Eat, drink and be merry&quot; as tenth.</P>

crystal trees had crystal trunks with beryl leaves and fruit. The
ruby trees had ruby trunks and emerald leaves and fruit, the emerald
trees had emerald trunks and ruby leaves and fruit, while the trees
of all sorts of gems were the same as regards trunks, leaves and
fruit. The sound of the leaves stirred by the wind was lovely,
delightful, sweet and intoxicating, just like that of the five kinds
of musical instruments<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote457anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote457sym"><SUP>457</SUP></A></SUP>

the Woman-Treasure was like cotton or silk, and her limbs were cool
when it was hot, and warm when it was cold. Her body smelt of
sandal-wood and her lips of lotus. This Woman-Treasure rose before
the King [176] and retired later, and was always willing to do his

2.6. 'And at that time, King Mahasudassana's eighty-four thousand
elephants waited on him everting and morning. And he thought: &quot;These
eighty-four thousand elephants wait on me evening and morning. How

accordingly to his Counsellor-Treasure, [189] and so it was done.</P>

2.7. 'And, Ananda, after many hundred, many hundred thousand years,
Queen Subhadda thought: &quot;It is a long time since I saw King
Mahasudassana. Suppose I were to go and see him?&quot; So she said to
her women: &quot;Come now, wash your heads and put on clean clothes.
It is long since we saw King Mahasudassana. We shall go to see him.&quot;
&quot;Yes, Your Majesty&quot;, they said, and prepared themselves as
ordered, then returned to the Queen. And Queen Subhadda said to the

2.8. 'Then Queen Subhadda went with the fourfold army and her
womenfolk to the Dhamma Palace and, entering, went to the great
gabled chamber and stood leaning against the door-post. And King
Mahasudassana, thinking: &quot;What is this great noise, as of a

leaning against the door-post. And he said: &quot;Stay there, Queen!
Do not enter!&quot;</P>

So she said to him: &quot;Sire, of your eighty-four thousand cities,

'This is how you should speak: &quot;All things that are pleasing and
attractive are liable to change, to vanish, to become otherwise. Do
not, Sire, die filled with longing. To die filled with longing is
painful and blameworthy. Of your eighty-four thousand cities,
Kusavati is the chief: abandon desire, abandon the longing to live
with them... Of your eighty-four thousand palaces, Dhamma is the
chief: abandon desire, abandon the longing to live there...&quot;
