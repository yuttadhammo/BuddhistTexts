Mahali Sutta: About Mahali Heavenly Sights, Soul and Body</H2>

[150] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Vesali, at
the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. And at that time a large number
of Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were staying at Vesali
on some business. And they heard say: 'The ascetic Gotama, son of the
Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan, is staying at
Vesali, at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. And concerning that
Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about: &quot;This Blessed
Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in
knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled
Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a
Blessed Lord.&quot; He proclaims this world with its gods, maras and
Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and
peoples, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a
Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle and
lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he
displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. And
indeed it is good to see such Arahants.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. And so these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha went to
the Great Forest, to the Gabled Hall. At that time the Venerable
Nagita was the Lord's personal attendant. So they approached the
Venerable Nagita and said: 'Reverend Nagita, where is the Reverend
Gotama now staying? We would like to see him.' [151]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Friends, it is not the right time to see the Lord. He is in solitary
meditation.' But the Brahmins just sat down to one side and said:
'When we have seen the Lord Gotama, we will go.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Just then Otthaddha the Licchavi came to the Gabled Hall with a
large company, saluted the Venerable Nagita and stood aside, saying:
'Where is the Blessed Lord staying, the Arahant, the
fully-enlightened Buddha? We would like to see him.' 'Mahali,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote169anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote169sym"><SUP>169</SUP></A></SUP>
it is not the right time to see the Lord, He is in solitary
meditation.' But Otthaddha just sat down to one side, and said: 'When
I have seen the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened
Buddha, I will go.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. Then the novice Siha<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote170anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote170sym"><SUP>170</SUP></A></SUP>
came to the Venerable Nagita, stood aside and said: 'Venerable
Kassapa,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote171anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote171sym"><SUP>171</SUP></A></SUP>
these many Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here
to see the Lord, and Otthaddha the Licchavi, too, has come with a
large company to see the Lord. It would be well, Venerable Kassapa,
to allow these people to see him.' 'Well then, Siha, you announce
them to the Lord.' 'Yes, Venerable Sir', said Siha. Then he went to
the Lord, saluted him, stood aside and said: 'Lord, these Brahmin
emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Lord,
and Otthaddha the Licchavi likewise with a large [152] company. It
would be well if the Lord were to let these people see him.' 'Then,
Siha, prepare a seat in the shade of this dwelling.' 'Yes, Lord',
said Siha, and did so. Then the Lord came out of his dwellingplace
and sat down on the prepared seat.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. The Brahmins approached the Lord. Having exchanged courtesies with
him, they sat down to one side. But Otthaddha did obeisance to the
Lord, and then sat down to one side, saying: 'Lord, not long ago
Sunakkhatta the Licchavi<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote172anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote172sym"><SUP>172</SUP></A></SUP>
came to me and said: &quot;Soon I shall have been a follower of the
Lord for three years. I have seen heavenly sights, pleasant,
delightful, enticing, but I have not heard any heavenly sounds that
were pleasant, delightful, enticing.&quot; Lord, are there any such
heavenly sounds, which Sunakkhatta cannot hear, or are there not?'
'There are such sounds, Mahali.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. 'Then, Lord, what is the reason, what is the cause why Sunakkahtta
cannot hear them?' [153] 'Mahali, in one case a monk, facing east,
goes into one-sided samadhi<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote173anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote173sym"><SUP>173</SUP></A></SUP>
and sees heavenly sights, pleasant, delightful, enticing... but does
not hear heavenly sounds. By means of this one-sided samadhi he sees
heavenly sights but does not hear heavenly sounds. Why is this?
Because this samadhi only leads to the seeing of heavenly sights, but
not to the hearing of heavenly sounds.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. 'Again, a monk facing south, west, north goes into a onesided
samadhi and facing upwards, downwards or across sees heavenly sights
[in that direction], but does not hear heavenly sounds. Why is this?
Because this samadhi only leads to the seeing of heavenly sights, but
not to the hearing of heavenly sounds. [154]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. 'In another case, Mahali, a monk facing east ... hears heavenly
sounds but does not see heavenly sights...</P>

downwards or across hears heavenly sounds, but does not see heavenly
sights...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
10. 'In another case, Mahali, a monk facing east goes into two-sided
samadhi and both sees heavenly sights, pleasant, delightful, enticing
[155] and hears heavenly sounds. Why is this? Because this two-sided
samadhi leads to both the seeing of heavenly sights and the hearing
of heavenly sounds.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
11. 'Again, a monk facing south, west, north, facing upwards,
downwards or across sees heavenly sights and hears heavenly sounds
... And that is the reason why Sunakkhatta comes to see heavenly
sights but not to hear heavenly sounds.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote174anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote174sym"><SUP>174</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
12. 'Well, Lord, is it for the realisation of such samadhistates that
monks lead the holy life under the Blessed Lord?' 'No, Mahali, there
are other things, higher and more perfect than these, for the sake of
which monks lead the holy life under me.' [156] 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
13. 'What are they, Lord?&quot;Mahali, in one case a monk, having
abandoned three fetters, becomes a Stream-Winner, not liable to
states of woe, firmly set on the path to enlightenment. Again, a monk
who has abandoned the three fetters, and has reduced his greed,
hatred and delusion, becomes a Once-Retumer who, having returned to
this world once more, will make an end of suffering. Again, a monk
who has abandoned the five lower fetters takes a spontaneous rebirth<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote175anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote175sym"><SUP>175</SUP></A></SUP>
[in a higher sphere] and, without returning from that world, gains
enlightenment. Again, a monk through the extinction of the
corruptions reaches in this very life the uncorrupted deliverance of
mind, the deliverance through wisdom, which he has realised by his
own insight. That is another thing higher and more perfect than
these, for the sake of which monks lead the holy life under me.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
14. 'Lord, is there a path, is there a method for the realisation of
these things?' 'There is a path, Mahali, there is a method.' [157]
'And, Lord, what is this path, what is this method?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'It is the Noble Eightfold Path, namely Right View, Right Thought;
Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood; Right Effort, Right
Mindfulness and Right Concentration. This is the path, this is the
way to the realisation of these things.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
15. 'Once, Mahali, I was staying at Kosambi, in the Ghosita Park. And
two wanderers, Mandissa and Jaliya, the pupil of the wooden-bowl
ascetic, came to me, exchanged courtesies with me, and sat down to
one side. Then they said: &quot;How is it, friend Gotama, is the
sou1<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote176anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote176sym"><SUP>176</SUP></A></SUP>
the same as the body, or is the soul one thing and the body another?&quot;
&quot;Well now, friends, you listen, pay proper attention, and I will
explain.&quot; &quot;Yes, friend&quot;, they said, and I went on:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
16. &quot;'Friends, a Tathagata arises in the world, an Arahant,
fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct,
Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be
tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He,
having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world
with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He
preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
displays the fullyperfected and purified holy life.</P>

&quot;'A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities (Sutta 2,
verses 41-63). On account of his morality, he sees no danger
anywhere. He experiences in himself the blameless bliss that comes
from maintaining this Ariyan morality. In this way, he is perfected
in morality. (as Sutta 2, verses 64-74) ... It is as if he were freed
from debt, from sickness, from bonds, from slavery, from the perils
of the desert... Being thus detached from sensedesires, detached from
unwholesome states, he enters and remains in the first jhana... and
so suffuses, drenches, fills and irradiates his body, that there is
no spot in his entire body that is untouched by this delight and joy
born of detachment. Now of one who thus knows and thus sees, is it
proper to say: 'The soul is the same as the body', or 'The soul is
different from the body'?&quot; &quot;It is not, friend.”<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote177anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote177sym"><SUP>177</SUP></A></SUP>
&quot;But I thus know and see, and I do not say that the soul is
either the same as, or different from the body.&quot;</P>

17. &quot;'And the same with the second..., the third..., [158] the
fourth jhana (as Sutta 2, verses 77-82).</P>

18. &quot;'The mind bends and tends towards knowledge and vision.
Now, of one who thus knows and thus sees, is it proper to say: 'The
soul is the same as the body', or 'The soul is different from the
body'?&quot; &quot;It is not, friend.&quot;</P>

thus knows and thus sees, is it proper to say: 'The soul is the same
as the body', or 'The soul is different from the body'?&quot; &quot;It
is not, friend.&quot; &quot;But I thus know and see, and I do not say
