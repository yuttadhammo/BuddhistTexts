[72] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote353anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote353sym"><SUP>353</SUP></A></SUP>
Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha on the mountain called
Vultures' Peak.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote354anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote354sym"><SUP>354</SUP></A></SUP>
Now just then King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote355anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote355sym"><SUP>355</SUP></A></SUP>
of Magadha wanted to attack the Vajjians.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote356anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote356sym"><SUP>356</SUP></A></SUP>
He said: 'I will strike the Vajjians who are so powerful and strong,
I will cut them off and destroy them, I will bring them to ruin and
destruction!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.2. And King Ajatasattu said to his chief minister the Brahmin
Vassakara: 'Brahmin, go to the Blessed Lord, worship him with your
head to his feet in my name, ask if he is free from sickness or
disease, if he is living at ease, vigorously and comfortably, and
then say: &quot;Lord, King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha wishes
to attack the Vajjians and says: 'I will strike the Vajjians...,
bring them to ruin and [73] destruction!&quot;' And whatever the Lord
declares to you, report that faithfully back to me, for Tathagatas
never lie.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.3. 'Very good, Sire', said Vassakara and, having had the state
carriages harnessed, he mounted one of them and drove in state from
Rajagaha to Vultures' Peak, riding as far as the ground would allow,
then continuing on foot to where the Lord was. He exchanged
courtesies with the Lord, then sat down to one side and delivered the
King's message.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.4. Now the Venerable Ananda was standing behind the Lord, fanning
him. And the Lord said: 'Ananda, have you heard that the Vajjians
hold regular and frequent assemblies?' 'I have heard, Lord, that they
do.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Ananda, as long as the Vajjians hold regular and frequent
assemblies, they may be expected to prosper and not decline. Have you
heard [74] that the Vajjians meet in harmony, break up in harmony,
and carry on their business in harmony?' 'I have heard, Lord, that
they do.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Ananda, as long as the Vajjians meet in harmony, break up in
harmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they may be expected
to prosper and not decline. Have you heard that the Vajjians do not
authorise what has not been authorised already, and do not abolish
what has been authorised, but proceed according to what has been
authorised by their ancient tradition?' 'I have, Lord.'...'Have you
heard that they honour, respect, revere and salute the elders among
them, and consider them worth listening to? ... that they do not
forcibly abduct others' wives and daughters and compel them to live
with them? ... that they honour, respect, revere and salute the
Vajjian shrines at home and abroad, not withdrawing the proper
support made and given before? ...[75] that proper provision is made
for the safety of Arahants, so that such Arahants may come in future
to live there, and those already there may dwell in comfort?' 'I
have, Lord.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Ananda, so long as such proper provision is made,... the Vajjians
may be expected to prosper and not decline.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.5. Then the Lord said to the Brahmin Vassakara: 'Once, Brahmin,
when I was at the Sarandada Shrine in Vesali, I taught the Vajjians
these seven principles for preventing dedine, and as long as they
keep to these seven principles, as long as these principles remain in
force, the Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not decline.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
At this, Vassakara replied: 'Reverend Gotama, if the Vajjians keep to
even one of these principles, they may be expected to prosper and not
[76] decline - far less all seven. Certainly the Vajjians will never
be conquered by King Ajatasattu by force of arms, but only by means
of propaganda<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote357anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote357sym"><SUP>357</SUP></A></SUP>
and setting them against one another. And now, Reverend Gotama, may I
depart? I am busy and have much to do.' 'Brahmin, do as you think
fit.' Then Vassakara, rejoicing and delighted at the Lord's words,
rose from his seat and departed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.6. Soon after Vassakara had gone, the Lord said: 'Ananda, go to
whatever monks there are round about Rajagaha, and summon them to the
assembly hall.' 'Very good, Lord', said Ananda, and did so. Then he
came to the Lord, saluted him, stood to one side and said: 'Lord, the
order of monks is assembled. Now is the time for the Lord to do as he
sees fit.' Then the Lord rose from his seat, went to the assembly
hall, sat down on the prepared seat, and said: 'Monks, I will teach
you seven things that are conducive to welfare.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote358anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote358sym"><SUP>358</SUP></A></SUP>
Listen, pay careful attention, and I will speak.' 'Yes, Lord', said
the monks, and the Lord said:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'As long as the monks hold regular and frequent assemblies, they may
be expected to prosper and not decline. As long as they meet in
harmony, break up in harmony, and carry on their [77] business in
harmony, they may be expected to prosper and not decline. As long as
they do not authorise what has not been authorised already, and do
not abolish what has been authorised, but proceed according to what
has been authorised by the rules of training...; as long as they
honour, respect, revere and salute the elders of long standing who
are long ordained, fathers and leaders of the order...; as long as
they do not fall prey to desires which arise in them and lead to
rebirth ... ; as long as they are devoted to forest-lodgings ... ; as
long as they preserve their personal mindfulness, so that in future
the good among their companions will come to them, and those who have
already come will feel at ease with them ... ; as long as the monks
hold to these seven things and are seen to do so, they may be
expected to prosper and not decline.</P>

1.7. 'I will tell you another seven things conducive to welfare ...

1.11. 'Monks, I will tell you six things that are conducive to
communal living ... As long as monks both in public and in private
show loving-kindness to their fellows in acts of body, speech and
thought,... share with their virtuous fellows whatever they receive
as a rightful gift, including the contents of their alms-bowls, which
they do not keep to themselves,... keep consistently, unbroken and
unaltered those rules of conduct that are spotless, leading to
liberation, praised by the wise, unstained and conducive to

may be expected to prosper and not decline.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.12. And then the Lord, while staying at Vultures' Peak, gave a
comprehensive discourse: 'This is morality, this is concentration,
this is wisdom. Concentration, when imbued with morality, brings
great fruit and profit. Wisdom, when imbued with concentration,
brings great fruit and profit. The mind imbued with wisdom becomes
completely free from the corruptions, that is, from the corruption of
sensuality, of becoming, of false views and of ignorance.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.13. And when the Lord had stayed at Rajagaha as long as he wished,
he said to the Venerable Ananda: 'Come, Ananda, let us go to
Ambalatthika.' 'Very good, Lord', said Ananda, and the Lord went
there with a large company of monks.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.14. And the Lord stayed in the royal park at Ambalatthika,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote361anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote361sym"><SUP>361</SUP></A></SUP>
and there he delivered a comprehensive discourse: 'This is morality,
this is concentration, this is wisdom...'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.15. Having stayed at Ambalatthika as long as he wished, the Lord
said to Ananda: 'Let us go to Nalanda , and they did so. At Nalanda
the Lord stayed in Pavarika's mango-grove.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.16. Then the Venerable Sariputta came to see the Lord, saluted him,
[82] sat down to one side, and said: 'It is dear to me, Lord, that
there never has been, will be or is now another ascetic or Brahmin
who is better or more enlightened than the Lord.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'You have spoken boldly with a bull's voice, Sariputta, you have
roared the lion's roar of certainty! How is this? Have all the
Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you, and were the minds of
all those Lords open to you, so as to say: &quot;These Lords were of
such virtue, such was their teaching, such their wisdom, such their
way, such their liberation&quot;?' 'No, Lord.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'And have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in
the future ... ?' 'No, Lord.'</P>

'Well then, Sariputta, you know me as the Arahant Buddha, and do you
know: &quot;The Lord is of such virtue, such is his teaching, such
his wisdom, such his way, such his liberation&quot;?’ 'No, Lord.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'So, Sariputta, you do not have knowledge of the minds of the Buddhas
of the past, the future or the present. Thus, Sariputta, [83] have
you not spoken boldly with a bull's voice and roared the lion's roar
of certainty with your declaration?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.17. 'Lord, the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past, future and
present are not open to me. But I know the drift of the Dhamma.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote362anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote362sym"><SUP>362</SUP></A></SUP>
Lord, it is as if there were a royal frontier city, with mighty
bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate, at
which was a gatekeeper, wise, skilled and clever, who kept out
strangers and let in those he knew. And he, constantly patrolling and
following along a path, might not see the joins and clefts in the
bastion, even such as a cat might creep through. But whatever larger
creatures entered or left the city, must all go through this very
gate. And it seems to me, Lord, that the drift of the Dhamma is the
same. All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme
enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, defilements of mind
that weaken the understanding, having firmly established the four
foundations of mindfulness in their minds, and realised the seven
factors of enlightenment as they really are. All the Arahant Buddhas
of the future will do likewise, and you, Lord, who are now the
Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, have done the same.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.18. Then, while staying at Nalanda, [84] in Pavarika's mangogrove,
the Lord gave a comprehensive discourse to the monks.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom...' (as
verse 12).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.19. And having stayed at Nalanda as long as he wished, the Lord
said to Ananda: 'Let us go to Pataligama.' And they did so.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.20. At Pataligama they heard say: 'The Lord has arrived here'. And
the lay-followers of Pataligama came to the Lord, saluted him, sat
down to one side, and said: 'May the Lord consent to stay at our
rest-house!' And the Lord consented by silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.21. Understanding his consent, they rose from their seats, saluted
the Lord and, passing him by to the right, went to the rest-house and
strewed the floor, prepared seats, provided a water-pot and filled
the oil-lamp. Then they went to the Lord, saluted him, stood to one
side and said: 'All is ready at the rest-house, Lord. Now is the time
to do as the Lord wishes.' [85]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.22. Then the Lord dressed, took his robe and bowl, and went with
his monks to the rest-house, where he washed his feet, went in and
sat down facing east, with his back against the central pillar. And
the monks, having washed their feet, went in and sat down with their
backs to the west wall, facing east, and with the Lord sitting in
front of them. And the layfollowers of Pataligama, having washed
their feet, went in and sat down with their backs to the east wall,
facing west and with the Lord before them.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.23. Then the Lord addressed the lay-followers of Pataligama:
'Householders, there are these five perils to one of bad morality, of
failure in morality. What are they? In the first place, he suffers
great loss of property through neglecting his affairs. In the second
place, he gets a bad reputation for immorality and misconduct. In the
third place, whatever assembly he approaches, whether of Khattiyas,
Brahmins, householders or ascetics, he does so diffidently and shyly.
In the fourth place, he dies confused. In the fifth place, after
death, at the breakingup of the body, he arises in an evil state, a
bad fate, in suffering and hell. These are the five perils to one of
bad morality.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[86] 1.24. 'And, householders, there are these five advantages to one
of good morality and of success in morality. What are they? In the
first place, through careful attention to his affairs he gains much
wealth. In the second place, he gets a good reputation for morality
and good conduct. In the third place, whatever assembly he
approaches, whether of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders or ascetics,
he does so with confidence and assurance. In the fourth place, he
dies unconfused. In the fifth place, after death, at the breaking-up
of the body, he arises in a good place, a heavenly world. These are
the five advantages to one of good morality, and of success in
morality.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.25. Then the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted the
lay-followers of Pataligama with talk on Dhamma until far into the
night. Then he dismissed them, saying: 'Householders, the night is
nearly over. Now it is time for you to do as you think fit.' 'Very
good, Lord', they said and, rising and saluting the Lord, they passed
him by to the right and departed. And the Lord spent the remainder of
the night in the rest-house left empty by their departure.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.26. Now at this time Sunidha and Vassakara, the Magadhan ministers,
were building a fortress in Pataligama as a defence against the
Vajjians. And at that time a multitude of [871 thousands of devas
were taking up lodging in Pataligama. And in the parts where powerful
devas settled, they caused the minds of the most powerful royal
officials to pick those sites for their dwellings, and where middle
and lower-ranking devas settled, so too they caused the minds of
royal officials of corresponding grade to pick those sites for their
dwellings.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.27. And the Lord, with his divine eye surpassing that of humans,
saw the thousands of devas taking up residence in Pataligama. And,
getting up at break of day, he said to the Venerable Ananda: 'Ananda,
who is building a fortress at Pataligama?' 'Lord, Sunidha and
Vassakara, the Magadhan ministers, are building a fortress against
the Vajjians.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.28. 'Ananda, just as if they had taken counsel with the
Thirty-Three Gods, Sunidha and Vassakara are building a fortress at
Pataligama. I have seen with my divine eye how thousands of devas
were taking up lodging there... (as verse 26). Ananda, as far as the
Ariyan realm extends, as far as its trade extends, this will be the
chief city, Pataliputta, scattering its seeds far and [88] wide. And
Pataliputta will face three perils: from fire, from water and from
internal dissension.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.29. Then Sunidha and Vassakara called on the Lord and, having
exchanged courtesies, stood to one side and said: 'May the Reverend
Gotama accept a meal from us tomorrow with his order of monks!' And
the Lord consented by silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.30. Understanding his consent, Sunidha and Vassakara went home and
there had a fine meal of hard and soft food prepared. When it was
ready, they reported to the Lord: 'Reverend Gotama, the meal is
ready.' Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, took his robe
and bowl, went with the order of monks to the residence of Sunidha
and Vassakara, and sat down on the prepared seat. Then Sunidha and
Vassakara served the Buddha and his order of monks with choice soft
and hard foods till they were satisfied. And when the Lord took his
hand away from the bowl they sat down on low stools to one side.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.31. And as they sat there, the Lord thanked them with these verses:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'In whatever realm the wise man makes his home, <BR>He should feed
the virtuous leaders of the holy life.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Whatever devas there are who report this offering, <BR>They will pay
him respect and honour for this. [89]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
They tremble for him as a mother for her son, <BR>And he for whom
devas tremble ever happy is.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Then the Lord rose from his seat and took his departure.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.32. Sunidha and Vassakara followed closely behind the Lord, saying:
'Whichever gate the ascetic Gotama goes out by today, that shall be
called the Gotama gate; and whichever ford he uses to cross the
Ganges, that shall be called the Gotama ford.' And so the gate by
which the Lord went out was called the Gotama Gate.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.33. And then the Lord came to the River Ganges. And just then, the
river was so full that a crow could drink out of it. And some people
were looking for a boat, and some were looking for a raft, and some
were binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. But
the Lord, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm
or flex it again, vanished from this side of the Ganges and
reappeared with his order of monks on the other shore.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.34. And the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat,
looking for a raft, and binding together a raft of reeds to get to
the other side. And seeing their intentions, he uttered this verse on
the spot:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'When they want to cross the sea, the lake or pond, People make a
bridge or raft - the wise have crossed already.'</P>
<H3 LANG="" CLASS="western">[End of first recitation-section]</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[90] 2.1. The Lord said to Ananda: 'Let us go to Kotigama.' 'Very
good, Lord', said Ananda, and the Lord went with a large company of
monks to Kotigama, and stayed there.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.2. Then the Lord addressed the monks thus: 'Monks, it is through
not understanding, not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that I as
well as you have for a long time run on and gone round the cycle of
birth-and-death. What are they? By not understanding the Noble Truth
of Suffering we have fared on, by not understanding the Noble Truth
of the Origin of Suffering, of the Cessation of Suffering, and of the
Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering we have fared on round the
cycle of birth-and-death. And by the understanding, the penetration
of the same Noble Truth of Suffering, of the Origin of Suffering, of
the Cessation of Suffering and of the Path Leading to the Cessation
of Suffering, the craving for becoming has been cut off, the support
of becoming has been destroyed, there is no more re-becoming.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.3. The Lord having said this, the Well-Farer having spoken, the

4.13. And when the Lord had stayed at Bhoganagara for as long as he
wished, he said: 'Ananda, let us go to Pava.' 'Very good, Lord', said
Ananda, and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Pava,
where he stayed at the mangogrove of Cunda the smith.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.14. And Cunda heard that the Lord had arrived at Pava and was

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.15. Then Cunda said: 'May the Lord accept a meal from me tomorrow

4.17. And as the night was ending Cunda had a fine meal of hard and

4.18. Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, took his robe and

hard and soft food to the order of monks.' 'Very good, Lord', said
Cunda, and did so.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.19. Then the Lord said to Cunda: Whatever is left over of the
&quot;pig's delight&quot; you should bury in a pit, because, Cunda, I
can see none in this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, in this
generation with its ascetics and Brahmins, its princes and people

Tathagata.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote408anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote408sym"><SUP>408</SUP></A></SUP>
'Very good, Lord', said Cunda and, having buried the remains of the

4.20. And after having eaten the meal provided by Cunda, the Lord was
attacked by a severe sickness with bloody diarrhoea, and with sharp

so.</P>

was going along the main road from Kusinara to Pava. Seeing the Lord

these wanderers are!</P>

4.27. 'Once, Lord, Alara Kalama was going along the main road and,
turning aside, he went and sat down under a nearby tree to take his
siesta. And five hundred carts went rumbling by very close to him. A
man who was walking along behind them came to Alara Kalama and said:
&quot;Lord, did you not see five hundred carts go by?&quot; &quot;No,
friend, I did not.&quot; &quot;But didn't you hear them, Lord?&quot;
&quot;No, friend, I did not.&quot; &quot;Well, were you asleep,
Lord?&quot; &quot;No, friend, I was not asleep.&quot; &quot;Then,
Lord, were you conscious?&quot; &quot;Yes, friend&quot;. &quot;So,
Lord, being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard five
hundred carts passing close by you, even though your outer robe was
bespattered with dust?&quot; &quot;That is so, friend.&quot;</P>

'And that man thought: &quot;It is wonderful, it is marvellous! These

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.28. 'Well, Pukkusa, what do you think? What do you consider is more
difficult to do or attain to - while conscious and awake not to see
or hear five hundred carts passing nearby or, while conscious and

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.29. 'Lord, how can one compare not seeing or hearing five hundred

4.30. 'Once, Pukkusa, when I was staying at Atuma, at the

4.32. &quot;'Friend, why are all these people gathered here?&quot;

you been?&quot; &quot;I have been right here, friend.&quot; &quot;But
what did you see, Lord?&quot; &quot;I saw nothing, friend.&quot; &quot;Or
what did you hear, Lord?&quot; &quot;I heard nothing, friend.&quot;
&quot;Were you sleeping, Lord?&quot; &quot;I was not sleeping,
friend.&quot; &quot;Then, Lord, were you conscious?&quot; &quot;Yes,

saw nor heard the great rainfall and floods and the thunder and

passed by to the right and departed.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.34. At this, Pukkusa the Malla said: 'Lord, I reject the lofty
powers of Alara Kalama as if they were blown away by a mighty wind or
carried off by a swift stream or river! Excellent, Lord, excellent!
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to
point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil lamp
into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there.
Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways.
[133] And I, Lord, go for refuge to the Blessed Lord, the Dhamma and
the Sangha. May the Blessed Lord accept me from this day forth as a
lay-follower as long as life shall last!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.35. Then Pukkusa said to one man: 'Go and fetch me two fine sets of
robes of cloth-of-gold, burnished and ready to wear.' 'Yes, Lord',
the man replied, and did so. And Pukkusa offered the robes to the
Lord, saying: 'Here, Lord, are two fine sets of robes of
cloth-of-gold. May the Blessed Lord be graciously pleased to accept
them!' 'Well then, Pukkusa, clothe me in one set and Ananda in the
other.' 'Very good, Lord', said Pukkusa, and did so.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote411anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote411sym"><SUP>411</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.36. Then the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted Pukkusa
the Malla with a talk on Dhamma. Then Pukkusa rose from his seat,
saluted the Lord, passed by to the right, and departed.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4.37. Soon after Pukkusa had gone, Ananda, having arranged one set of
the golden robes on the body of the Lord, observed that against the
Lord's body it appeared dulled. And he said: 'It is wonderful, Lord,
it is marvellous how clear and bright the Lord's skin appears! It
looks even brighter than the golden [134] robes in which it is
clothed.' 'Just so, Ananda. There are two occasions on which the
Tathagata's skin appears especially clear and bright. Which are they?
One is the night in which the Tathagata gains supreme enlightenment,
the other is the night when he attains the Nibbana-element without
remainder at his final passing. On these two occasions the
Tathagata's skin appears especially clear and bright.</P>

4.38. 'Tonight, Ananda, in the last watch, in the sal-grove of the

passing will take place. And now, Ananda, let us go to the River
Kakuttha.' 'Very good, Lord', said Ananda.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote412anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote412sym"><SUP>412</SUP></A></SUP></P>

4.39. Then the Lord went with a large number of monks to the River
Kakuttha. He entered the water, bathed and drank and, emerging, went
to the mango grove, where he said to the Venerable Cundaka: 'Come,

gained final Nibbana after taking his last meal from you!&quot; But
Cunda's remorse should be expelled in this way: &quot;That is your

Nibbana after taking his last meal from you! For, friend Cunda, I

alms-givings are of very great [136] fruit, of very great result,
more fruitful and advantageous than any other. Which two? The one is
the alms-giving after eating which the Tathagata attains supreme
enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the
Nibbana-element without remainder at his final passing. These two
alms-givings are more fruitful and profitable than all others.
Cunda's deed is conducive to long life, to good looks, to happiness,
to fame, to heaven and to lordship.&quot; In this way, Ananda,
Cunda's remorse is to be expelled.'</P>

of a wheel-turning monarch are wrapped in a new linen-cloth. This
they wrap in teased cotton wool, and this in a [142] new cloth.

with the remains of a wheel-turning monarch, and they should deal
with the Tathagata's body in the same way. A stupa should be erected

Ananda, at the thought: &quot;This is the stupa of a Tathagata, of a

compounded is subject to decay - how could it be that it should not

5.18. 'Once upon a time, Ananda, King Mahasudassana was a
wheel-turning monarch, a rightful and righteous king, who had
conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his
realm, and who possessed the seven treasures. And, Ananda, this King
Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara, under the name of Kusavati, for
his capital. And it was twelve yojanas long from east to west, and
seven yojanas wide from north to south. Kusavati was rich, prosperous
[147] and well-populated, crowded with people and well-stocked with
food. Just as the deva-city of Alakamanda<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote429anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote429sym"><SUP>429</SUP></A></SUP>
is rich, prosperous and well-populated, crowded with yakkhas and
well-stocked with food, so was the royal city of Kusavati. And the
city of Kusavati was never free of ten sounds by day or night: the
sound of elephants, horses, carriages, kettle-drums, side-drums,
lutes, singing, cymbals and gongs, with cries of &quot;Eat, drink and
be merry!&quot; as tenth.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote430anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote430sym"><SUP>430</SUP></A></SUP></P>

in the last watch, the Tathagata will attain final Nibbana. Approach
him, Vasetthas, approach him, lest later you should regret it,
saying: 'The Tathagata passed away in our parish, and we did not take
the opportunity to see him for the last time!&quot;&quot; 'Very good,
Lord', said Ananda and, taking robe and bowl, he went with a
companion to Kusinara.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.20. Just then the Mallas of Kusinara were assembled in their
meeting-hall on some business. And Ananda came to them and delivered
the Lord's words. [148]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.21. And when they heard Ananda's words, the Mallas, with their
sons, daughters-in-law and wives were struck with anguish and sorrow,
their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all weeping
and tearing their hair ...Then they all went to the sal-grove where
the Venerable Ananda was.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.22. And Ananda thought: 'If I allow the Mallas of Kusinara to
salute the Lord individually, the night will have passed before they
have all paid homage. I had better let them pay homage family by
family, saying: &quot;Lord, the Malla so-and-so with his children,
his wife, his servants and his friends pays homage at the Lord's
feet.&quot;' And so he presented them in that way, and thus allowed
all the Mallas of Kusinara to pay homage to the Lord in the first
watch.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.23. And at that time a wanderer called Subhadda was in Kusinara,
and he heard that the ascetic Gotama was to, attain final Nibbana in
the final watch of that night. [149] He thought: 'I have heard from
venerable wanderers, advanced in years, teachers of teachers, that a
Tathagata, a fully-enlightened Buddha, only rarely arises in the
world. And tonight in the last watch the ascetic Gotama will attain
final Nibbana. Now a doubt has arisen in my mind, and I feel sure
that the ascetic Gotama can teach me a doctrine to dispel that
doubt.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.24. So Subhadda went to the Mallas' sal-grove, to where the
Venerable Ananda was, and told him what he had thought: 'Reverend
Ananda, may I be permitted to see the ascetic Gotama?' But Ananda
replied: 'Enough, friend Subhadda, do not disturb the Tathagata, the
Lord is weary.' And Subhadda made his request a second and a third
time, but still Ananda [150] refused it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.25. But the Lord overheard this conversation between Ananda and
Subhadda, and he called to Ananda: 'Enough, Ananda, do not hinder
Subhadda, let him see the Tathagata. For whatever Subhadda asks me he
will ask in quest of enlightenment<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote432anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote432sym"><SUP>432</SUP></A></SUP>
and not to annoy me, and what I say in reply to his questions he will
quickly understand.' Then Ananda said: 'Go in, friend Subhadda, the
Lord gives you leave.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5.26. Then Subhadda approached the Lord, exchanged courtesies with
him, and sat down to one side, saying: 'Venerable Gotama, all those
ascetics and Brahmins who have orders and followings, who are
teachers, well-known and famous as founders of schools, and popularly
regarded as saints, like Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita
Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sanjaya Belatthaputta and the
Nigantha Nataputta - have they all realised the truth as they all
make out, or have none [151] of them realised it, or have some
realised it and some not?' 'Enough, Subhadda, never mind whether all,
or none, or some of them have realised the truth. I will teach you
Dhamma, Subhadda. Listen, pay close attention, and I will speak.'
'Yes, Lord', said Subhadda, and the Lord said:</P>

But such ascetics can be found, of the first, second, third and
fourth grade in a Dhamma and discipline where the Noble Eightfold
Path is found. Now, Subhadda, in this Dhamma and discipline the Noble
Eightfold Path is found, and in it are to be found ascetics of the
first, second, third and fourth grade. Those other schools are devoid
of [true] ascetics; but if in this one the monks were to live the

And those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore
their hair, raising their arms, throwing themselves down and twisting
and turning, crying: 'All too soon [158] the Blessed Lord has passed
away, all too soon the WellFarer has passed away, all too soon the
Eye of the World has disappeared!' But those monks who were free from

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.11. Then the Venerable Anuruddha said: 'Friends, enough of your
weeping and wailing! Has not the Lord already told you that all
things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable, subject to
separation and to becoming other? So why all this, friends? Whatever
is born, become, compounded is subject to decay, it cannot be that it
does not decay. The devas, friends, are grumbling.'</P>

'Venerable Anuruddha, what kind of devas are you aware of?' 'Friend

weeping and tearing their hair ... And there are earth-devas whose
minds are earth-bound, they do likewise. But those devas who are free

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.12. Then the Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable Ananda spent the
rest of the night in conversation on Dhamma. And the Venerable
Anuruddha said: 'Now go, friend Ananda, to Kusinara and announce to
the Mallas: &quot;Vasetthas, the Lord has passed away. Now is the
time to do as you think fit.&quot; &quot;Yes, Lord&quot;, said
Ananda, and having dressed in the morning and taken his robe and
bowl, he went with a companion to Kusinara. [159] At that time the
Mallas of Kusinara were assembled in their meeting-hall on some
business. And the Venerable Ananda came to them and delivered the
Venerable Anuruddha's message. And when they heard the Venerable
Ananda's words, the Mallas ... were struck with anguish and sorrow,
their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all tearing
their hair...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.13. Then the Mallas ordered their men to bring perfume and wreaths,
and gather all the musicians together. And with the perfumes and
wreaths, and all the musicians, and with five hundred sets of
garments they went to the sal-grove where the Lord's body was lying.
And there they honoured, paid respects, worshipped and adored the
Lord's body with dance and song and music, with garlands and scents,
making awnings and circular tents in order to spend the day there.
And they thought: 'It is too late to cremate the Lord's body today.
We shall do so tomorrow.' And so, paying homage in the same way, they
waited for a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth day.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.14. And on the seventh day the Mallas of Kusinara thought: [160]
'We have paid sufficient honour with song and dance... to the Lord's
body, now we shall burn his body after carrying him out by the south
gate.' Then eight Malla chiefs, having washed their heads and put on
new clothes, declared: 'Now we will lift up the Lord's body', but
found they were unable to do so. So they went to the Venerable
Anuruddha and told him what had happened: 'Why can't we lift up the
Lord's body?' 'Vasetthas, your intention is one thing, but the
intention of the devas is another.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.15. 'Lord, what is the intention of the devas?' 'Vasetthas, your
intention is, having paid homage to the Lord's body with dance and
song..., to burn his body after carrying him out by the south gate.
But the devas' intention is, having paid homage to the Lord's body
with heavenly dance and song..., to carry him to the north of the
city, bring him in through the north gate and bear him through the
middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas'
shrine of MakutaBandhana, and there to burn the body.' 'Lord, if that
is the devas' intention, so be it!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.16. At that time even the sewers and rubbish-heaps of Kusinara were
covered knee-high with coral-tree flowers. And the devas as well as
the Mallas of Kusinara honoured the Lord's body with divine and human
[161] dancing, song...; and they carried the body to the north of the
city, brought it in through the north gate, through the middle of the
city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas' shrine of
MakutaBandhana, where they set the body down.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.17. Then they asked the Venerable Ananda: 'Lord, how should we deal
with the body of the Tathagata?' 'Vasetthas, you should deal with the
Tathagata's body as you would that of a wheel-turning monarch.' 'And
how do they deal with that, Lord?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Vasetthas, the remains are wrapped in a new linen-cloth. This they
wrap in teased cotton-wool...; then having made a funeral-pyre of all

6.19. Now just then the Venerable Kassapa the Great<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote448anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote448sym"><SUP>448</SUP></A></SUP>
was travelling along the main road from Pava to Kusinara with a large
company of about five hundred monks. And leaving the road, the
Venerable Kassapa the Great sat down under a tree. And a certain
Ajivika<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote449anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote449sym"><SUP>449</SUP></A></SUP>
chanced to be coming along the main road towards Pava, and he had
picked a coral-tree flower in Kusinara. The Venerable Kassapa saw him
coming from afar, and said to him: 'Friend, do you know our Teacher?'
'Yes, friend, I do. The ascetic Gotama passed away a week ago. I
picked this coral-tree flower there.' And those monks who had not yet
overcome their passions wept and tore their hair... But those monks
who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware,
saying: 'All compounded things are impermanent - what is the use of
this?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.20. And sitting in the group was one Subhadda,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote450anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote450sym"><SUP>450</SUP></A></SUP>
who had gone forth late in life, and he said to those monks: 'Enough,
friends, do not weep and wail! We are well rid of the Great Ascetic.
We were always bothered by his saying: &quot;It is fitting for you to
do this, it is not fitting for you to do that!&quot; Now we can do
what we like, and not do what we don't like!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
But the Venerable Kassapa the Great said to the monks: 'Friends,
enough of your weeping and wailing! [163] Has not the Lord already
told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are
changeable, subject to separation and becoming other? So why all
this, friends? Whatever is born, become, compounded is subject to

6.21. Meanwhile four Malla chiefs, having washed their heads and put
on new clothes, said: 'We will light the Lord's funeral pyre', but
they were unable to do so. They went to the Venerable Anuruddha and
asked him why this was. 'Vasetthas, your intention is one thing, but
that of the devas is another.' 'Well, Lord, what is the intention of
the devas?' 'Vasetthas, the devas' intention is this: &quot;The
Venerable Kassapa the Great is coming along the main road from Pava
to Kusinara with a large company of five hundred monks. The Lord's
funeral pyre will not be lit until the Venerable Kassapa the Great
has paid homage with his head to the Lord's feet.' 'Lord, if that is
the devas' intention, so be it!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.22. Then the Venerable Kassapa the Great went to the Mallas' shrine
at Makuta-Bandhana to the Lord's funeral pyre and, covering one
shoulder with his robe, joined his hands in salutation,
circumambulated the pyre three times and, uncovering the Lord's feet,
paid homage with his head to them, and the five hundred monks did
likewise. [164] And when this was done, the Lord's funeral pyre
ignited of itself.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.23. And when the Lord's body was burnt, what had been skin,
under-skin, flesh, sinew, or joint-fluid, all that vanished and not
even ashes or dust remained, only the bones<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote451anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote451sym"><SUP>451</SUP></A></SUP>
remained. Just as when butter or oil is burnt, no ashes or dust
remain, so it was with the Lord's body..., only the bones were left.
And all the five hundred garments, even the innermost and the
outermost cloth, were burnt up. And when the Lord's body was burnt
up, a shower of water from the sky, and another which burst forth
from the sal-trees<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote452anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote452sym"><SUP>452</SUP></A></SUP>
extinguished the funeral pyre. And the Mallas of Kusinara poured
perfumed water over it for the same purpose. Then the Mallas honoured
the relics for a week in their assembly hall, having made a
lattice-work of spears and an encircling wall of bows, with dancing,
singing, garlands and music.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6.24. And King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha heard that the Lord
had passed away at Kusinara. And he sent a message to the Mallas of
Kusinara: 'The Lord was a Khattiya and I am a Khattiya. I am worthy
to receive a share of the Lord's remains. I will make a great stupa
for them.' The Licchavis of Vesali heard, and they sent a message:
'The Lord was a Khattiya and we are Khattiyas. We are worthy to [165]
receive a share of the Lord's remains, and we will make a great stupa
for them.' The Sakyas of Kapilavatthu heard, and they sent a message:
'The Lord was the chief of our clan. We are worthy to receive a share
of the Lord's remains, and we will make a great stupa for them.' 'The
Bulayas of Allakappa and the Koliyas of Ramagama replied similarly.
The Brahmin of Vethadipa heard, and he sent a message: 'The Lord was
a Khattiya, I am a Brahmin...', and the Mallas of Pava sent a
message: 'The Lord was a Khattiya, we are Khattiyas. We are worthy to
receive a share of the Lord's remains, and we will make a great stupa

6.25. On hearing all this, the Mallas of Kusinara addressed the
crowd, saying: [166] 'The Lord passed away in our parish. We will not
give away any share of the Lord's remains.' At this the Brahmin Dona
addressed the crowd in this verse:</P>

'Well then, Brahmin, you divide up the remains of the Lord in the

6.27. Then King Ajatasattu of Magadha built a great stupa for the
