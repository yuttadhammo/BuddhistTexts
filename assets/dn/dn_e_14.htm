Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, in Anathapindika's park in the
jeta grove, in the Karen hutment. And among a number of monks who had
gathered together after their meal, after the alms-round, sitting in
the Karen pavilion, there arose a serious discussion on former lives,
as they said: 'This is how it was in a former life', or 'hat was how
it was.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.2. And the Lord, with the purified divine-ear faculty surpassing
the powers of humans, heard what they were talking about. Getting up
from his seat, he went to the Karen pavilion, sat down on the
prepared seat, and said: 'Monks, what was your conversation as you
sat together? What discussion did I interrupt?' And they told him.

1.3. 'Well, monks, would you like to hear a proper discourse on past
lives?' 'Lord, it is time for that! Well-Farer, it is time for that!
If the Lord were to give a proper discourse on past lives, the monks
would listen and remember it!' 'Well then, monks, listen, pay close
attention, and I will speak.'</P>

'It is marvellous, friends, it is wonderful, the Tathagata's great
power and ability - the way he recalls past Buddhas who have gained
Parinibbana, having cut away the hindrances, cut off the road [of
craving], put an end to the round of becoming, overcome all
suffering. He recalls their birth, their name, their clan, their
life-span, the disciples and assemblies connected with him: &quot;Being
born thus, these Blessed Lords were such-and-such, such were their
names, their clans, their discipline, their Dhamma, their wisdom,
their liberation.&quot; Well now, friends, how did the Tathagata come
by the penetrative knowledge through which he remembers all this ...
? Did some deva reveal this knowledge to [9] him?' This was the
conversation of those monks which came to be interrupted.</P>

1.14. Then the Lord, rising from the seclusion of the restperiod,
went to the Kareri pavilion and sat down on the prepared seat. He
said: 'Monks, what was your conversation as you sat together? What

penetration of the principles of Dhamma; and devas, too, have told
him. Well, monks, do you wish to hear still more [11] about past
