[161] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Ujunnaya in
the deer-park of Kannakatthale.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote180anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote180sym"><SUP>180</SUP></A></SUP>
There the naked ascetic Kassapa came to him, exchanged courtesies
with him, and stood to one side. Then he said:</P>

2. 'Friend Gotama, I have heard it said: &quot;The ascetic Gotama

lead a harsh life of self-mortification.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote181anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote181sym"><SUP>181</SUP></A></SUP>
Now are those who say this telling the truth, and do they not slander
the Lord Gotama with lies? Do they explain the truth about his Dhamma
and what pertains to it, or does some fellowteacher of a different
sect deserve to be blamed for this statement? We would like to see
the Lord Gotama refute this charge.&quot;</P>

3. 'Kassapa, those who say this are not telling the truth, they
slander me with lies. The situation occurs, Kassapa, that I see one
practiser of mortification, and with the divine [162] eye<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote182anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote182sym"><SUP>182</SUP></A></SUP>
which is purified beyond the sight of humans I see him arising after
death, at the breaking-up of the body, in a place of woe, a baleful
state, a place of destruction, in hell. Again, I see one practiser of
mortification... arising after death in a good place, a heavenly
state. Again, I see one who practises little austerity... arising in
a state of woe ... Again, I see one who practises little austerity
... arising after death in a good place, a heavenly state. Since I
can see as it is the arising, the destiny, the death and re-arising
of those ascetics, how could I disapprove of all austerities, and
censure and blame all those who lead a harsh life of
self-mortification?</P>

4. 'Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who are wise,
skilled, practised in disputation, splitters of hairs, acute, who
walk cleverly along the paths of views. Sometimes their views accord
with mine, sometimes they do not. What they sometimes applaud, we

15. 'Kassapa, a practiser of self-mortification may do all these

Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely
in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the
fullyperfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes forth and
practises the moralities (Sutta 2, verses 41-63). [172] That is the
perfection of morality. He guards the sense-doors, etc. and attains
the four jhanas (Sutta 2 verses 64-82). [173-4] That is the
perfection of the heart. He attains various insights and the
cessation of the corruptions (Sutta 2, verses 83-98). That is the
perfection of wisdom. And, Kassapa, there is nothing further or more

bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could
