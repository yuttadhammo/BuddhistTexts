Payasi Sutta: About Payasi - Debate with a Sceptic</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[316] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Venerable KumaraKassapa<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote700anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote700sym"><SUP>700</SUP></A></SUP>
was touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred
monks, and he came to stay at a town called Setavya. He stayed to the
north of Setavya in the Sirhsapa Forest.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote701anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote701sym"><SUP>701</SUP></A></SUP>
And at that time Prince Payasi was living at Setavya, a populous
place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to
him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal
powers.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote702anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote702sym"><SUP>702</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. And Prince Payasi developed the following evil opinion: 'There is
no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no
fruit or result [317] of good or evil deeds.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote703anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote703sym"><SUP>703</SUP></A></SUP>
Meanwhile, the Brahmins and householders of Setavya heard the news:
'The ascetic Kumara-Kassapa, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is
touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred
monks; he has arrived at Setavya and is staying to the north of
Setavya in the Sirhsapa Forest; and concerning the Reverend Kassapa a
good report has been spread about: &quot;He is learned, experienced,
wise, well-informed, a fine speaker, able to give good replies,
venerable, an Arahant.&quot; And it is good to see such Arahants.'
And so the Brahmins and householders of Setavya, leaving Setavya by
the north gate in large numbers, made for the Sitsapa Forest.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. And just then, Prince Payasi had gone up to the verandah for his
midday rest. Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for the
Simsapa Forest, he asked his steward why. [318] The steward said:
'Sir, it is the ascetic KumaraKassapa, a disciple of the ascetic
Gotama,... and concerning him a good report has been spread about
...That is why they are going to see him.' 'Well then, steward, you
go to the Brahmins and householders of Setavya and say: &quot;Gentlemen,
Prince Payasi says: 'Please wait, the Prince will come to see the
ascetic Kumara-Kassapa.&quot;' Already this ascetic Kumara-Kassapa
has been teaching these foolish and inexperienced Brahmins and
householders of Setavya that there is another world, that there are
spontaneously born beings, and that there is fruit and result of good
and evil deeds. But no such things exist.' 'Very good, sir', said the
steward, and delivered the message.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. Then Prince Payasi, accompanied by the Brahmins and householders
of Setavya, went to the Simsapa Forest where the Venerable
Kumara-Kassapa was. Having exchanged courtesies with the Venerable
Kumara Kassapa, [319] he sat down to one side. And some of the
Brahmins and householders saluted the Venerable Kumara-Kassapa and
then sat down to one side, while some first exchanged courtesies with
him, some saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name
and clan, and some silently sat down to one side.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. Then Price Payasi said to the Venerable Kumara-Kassapa: 'Reverend
Kassapa, I hold to this tenet and this view: There is no other world,
there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result
of good or evil deeds.' 'Well, Prince, I have never seen or heard of
such a tenet or view as you declare. And so, Prince, I will question
you about it, and you shall reply as you think fit. What do you
think, Prince? Are the sun and the moon in this world or another, are
they gods or humans?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Reverend Kassapa, they are in another world, and they are gods, not
humans.' 'In the same way, Prince, you should consider: &quot;There
is another world, there are spontaneously born beings, there is fruit
and result of good and evil deeds.&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. 'Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think
there is no other world...' 'Have you any reasons for this assertion,
Prince?' [320] 'I have, Reverend Kassapa.' 'How is that, Prince?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Reverend Kassapa, I have friends, colleagues and bloodrelations who
take life, take what is not given, commit sexual offences, tell lies,
use abusive, harsh and frivolous speech, who are greedy, full of
hatred and hold wrong views. Eventually they become ill, suffering,
diseased. And when I am sure they will not recover, I go to them and
say: &quot;There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and
believe that those who take life,...hold wrong views will, after
death at the breaking-up of the body, be born in a state of woe, an
evil place, a place of punishment, in hell. Now you have done these
things, and if what these ascetics and Brahmins say is true, that is
where you will go. Now if, after death, you go to a state of woe,...
come to me and declare that there is another world, there are
spontaneously born beings, there is fruit and result of good and evil
deeds. You, gentlemen, are trustworthy and dependable, and what you
have seen shall be as if I had seen it myself, so it will be.&quot;
But although they agreed, [321] they neither came to tell me, nor did
they send a messenger. That, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for
maintaining: &quot;There is no other world, there are no
spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result of good or
evil deeds.&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. 'As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall
reply as you think fit. What do you think, Prince? Suppose they were
to bring a thief before you caught in the act, and say: &quot;This
man, Lord, is a thief caught in the act. Sentence him to any
punishment you wish.&quot; And you might say: &quot;Bind this man's
arms tightly behind him with a strong rope, shave his head closely,
and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and
squares and out through the southern gate, and there cut off his
head.&quot; And they, saying: &quot;Very good&quot; in assent, might
... lead him out through the southern gate, and there cut off his
head.&quot; Now if that thief were to say to the executioners: &quot;Good
executioners, in this town or village I have friends, colleagues and
blood-relations, please wait till I have visited them&quot;, would he
get his wish? [322] Or would they just cut off that talkative thief's
head?' 'He would not get his wish, Reverend Kassapa. They would just
cut off his head.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'So, Prince, this thief could not get even his human executioners to
wait while he visited his friends and relations. So how can your
friends, colleagues and blood-relations who have committed all these
misdeeds, having died and gone to a place of woe, prevail upon the
warders of hell, saying: &quot;Good warders of hell, please wait
while we report to Prince Payasi that there is another world, there
are spontaneously born beings, and there is fruit and result of good
and evil deeds&quot;? Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another
world...'</P>

'Reverend Kassapa, I have friends ... who abstain from taking life,
from taking what is not given, from committing sexual [323] offences,
from telling lies or using abusive, harsh and frivolous speech, who
are not greedy or full of hatred and who have right views.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote704anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote704sym"><SUP>704</SUP></A></SUP>
Eventually they become ill ... and when I am sure they will not

Brahmins who declare and believe that those who abstain from taking
life ... and have right views will, after death at the breaking-up of
the body, be born in a happy state, a heavenly world. Now you have
refrained from doing these things, and if what these ascetics and
Brahmins say is true, that is where you will go. Now if, after death,
you go to a happy state, a heavenly world, come to me and declare
that there is another world ... You, gentlemen, are trustworthy and

9. 'Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable, because some wise
people understand what is said by means of parables. Suppose a man
had fallen head first into a cesspit, and you were to say to your
men: &quot;Pull that man out of the cesspit!&quot; and they would
say: &quot;Very good&quot;, and do so. Then you would tell them to
clean his body thoroughly of the filth with bamboo scrapers, and then
to give him a triple shampoo with yellow loam. Then you would tell
them to anoint his body with oil and then to clean him three times
with fine soappowder. Then you would tell them to dress his hair and
beard, and to adorn him with fine garlands, ointments and clothes.
[325] Finally you would tell them to lead him up to your palace and
let him indulge in the pleasures of the five senses, and they would
do so. What do you think, Prince? Would that man, having been well
washed, with his hair and beard dressed, adorned and garlanded,
clothed in white, and having been conveyed up to the palace, enjoying
and revelling in the pleasures of the five senses, want to be plunged
once more into that cesspit?' 'No, Reverend Kassapa.' 'Why not?'
'Because that cesspit is unclean and considered so, evilsmelling,
horrible, revolting, and generally considered to be so.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'In just the same way, Prince, human beings are unclean,
evil-smelling, horrible, revolting and generally considered to be so
by the devas. So why should your friends ... who have not committed
any of the offences ... (as verse 8), and who have after death been
born in a happy state, a heavenly world, come back and say: &quot;There
is another world,... there is fruit [326] of good and evil deeds&quot;?
Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world...'</P>

heavenly world, as companions of the Thirty-Three Gods...&quot;[327]

11. 'As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall
answer as you think fit. That which is for human beings, Prince, a
hundred years is for the Thirty-Three Gods one day and night. Thirty
of such nights make a month, twelve such months a year, and a
thousand such years are the life-span of the Thirty-Three Gods. Now
suppose they were to think: &quot;After we have indulged in the
pleasures of the five senses for two or three days we will go to
Payasi and tell him there is another world, there are spontaneously
born beings, there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds&quot;,
would they have done so?' 'No, Reverend Kassapa, because we should be
longsince dead. But, Reverend Kassapa, who has told you that the
Thirty-Three Gods exist, and that they are so long-lived? I don't
[328] believe the Thirty-Three Gods exist or are so longlived.'</P>

'Prince, imagine a man who was blind from birth and could not see
dark or light objects, or blue, yellow, red or crimson ones, could
not see the smooth and the rough, could not see the stars and the
moon. He might say: &quot;There are no dark and light objects and
nobody who can see them,... there is no sun or moon, and nobody who
can see them. I am not aware of this thing, and therefore it does not
exist.&quot; Would he be speaking rightly, Prince?' 'No, Reverend
Kassapa. There are dark and light objects. [329] there is a sun and a
moon, and anyone who said: &quot;I am not aware of this thing, I
cannot see it, and therefore it does not exist&quot; would not be
speaking rightly.'</P>

'Well, Prince, it appears that your reply is like that of the blind
man when you ask how I know about the Thirty-Three Gods and their
longevity. Prince, the other world cannot be seen the way you think,
with the physical eye. Prince, those ascetics and Brahmins who seek
in the jungle-thickets and the recesses of the forest for a
resting-place that is quiet, with little noise - they stay there
unwearied, ardent, restrained, purifying the divine eye,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote705anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote705sym"><SUP>705</SUP></A></SUP>
and with that purified divine eye that exceeds the powers of human
sight, they see both this world and the next, and spontaneously born
beings. That, Prince, is how the other world can be seen, and not the
way you think, with the physical eye. Therefore, Prince, admit that
there is another world, that there are spontaneously born beings, and

'Well, Reverend Kassapa, I see here some ascetics and Brahmins who
observe morality and are well-conducted, who want to live, do not
want to die, who desire comfort and hate suffering. And it seems to
me that if these good ascetics and Brahmins who are so moral and
well-conducted know that after death they will be better off, then
these good people would now take poison, take a knife and kill
themselves, hang themselves or jump off a cliff. But though they have
such knowledge, they still want to live, do not want to die, they
desire comfort and hate suffering. And that, Reverend Kassapa, is my
reason for maintaining: &quot;There is no other world</P>

13. 'Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable, because some wise
people understand what is said by means of parables. Once upon a
time, Prince, a certain Brahmin had two wives. One had a son ten or
twelve years old, while the other was pregnant and nearing her time
when the Brahmin died. Then this youth said to his mother's co-wife:
&quot;Lady, whatever wealth and possessions, silver or gold, there
may be, is all [331] mine. My father made me his heir.&quot; At this
the Brahmin lady said to the youth: &quot;Wait, young man, until I
give birth. If the child is a boy, one portion will be his, and if it
is a girl, she will become your servant.&quot; The youth repeated his
words a second time, and received the same reply. When he repeated
them a third time, the lady took a knife and, going into an inner
room, cut open her belly, thinking: &quot;If only I could find out
whether it is a boy or a girl!&quot; And thus she destroyed herself
and the living embryo, and the wealth as well, just as fools do who
seek their inheritance unwisely, heedless of hidden danger.</P>

'In the same way you, Prince, will foolishly enter on hidden dangers
by unwisely seeking for another [332] world, just as that Brahmin
lady did in seeking her inheritance. But, Prince, those ascetics and
Brahmins who observe morality and are well-conducted do not seek to
hasten the ripening of that which is not yet ripe, but rather they
wisely await its ripening. Their life is profitable to those ascetics
and Brahmins, for the longer such moral and well-conducted ascetics
and Brahmins remain alive, the greater the merit that they create;
they practise for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the
many, out of compassion for the world, for the profit and benefit of
devas and humans. Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another
world...'</P>

close it with a damp skin, give it a thick covering of damp clay,

21. 'Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable ... Once there was
a matted-haired fire-worshipper<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote713anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote713sym"><SUP>713</SUP></A></SUP>
who dwelt in the forest in a leaf-hut. And a certain tribe was on the
move, and its leader stayed for one night near the fire-worshipper's
dwelling, and then left. So the fire-worshipper thought [340] he
would go to the site to see if he could find anything he could make
use of. He got up early and went to the site, and there he saw a tiny
delicate baby boy lying abandoned on his back. At the sight he
thought: &quot;It would not be right for me to look on and let a
human being die. I had better take this child to my hermitage, take
care of him, feed him and bring him up.&quot; So he did so. When the
boy was ten or twelve, the hermit had some business to do in the
neighbourhood. So he said to the boy: &quot;I want to go to the
neighbourhood, my son. You look after the fire and don't let it go
out. If it should go out, here is an axe, here are some sticks, here
are the fire-sticks, so you can relight the fire and look after it.&quot;
Having thus instructed the boy, the hermit went into the
neighbourhood. But the boy, being absorbed in his games, let the fire
go out. Then he thought: &quot;Father said: '...here is an axe ... so
you can relight the fire and look after it.' Now I'd better do so!&quot;
[341] So he chopped up the fire-sticks with the axe, thinking: &quot;I
expect I'll get a fire this way.&quot; But he got no fire. He cut the
fire-sticks into two, into three, into four, into five, ten, a
hundred pieces, he splintered them, he pounded them in a mortar, he
winnowed them in a great wind, thinking: &quot;I expect I'll get a
fire this way.&quot; But he got no fire, and when the hermit came
back, having finished his business, he said: &quot;Son, why have you
let the fire go out?&quot; and the boy told him what had happened.
The hermit thought: &quot;How stupid this boy is, how senseless! What
a thoughtless way to try to get a fire!&quot; So, while the boy
looked on, he took the fire-sticks and rekindled the fire, saying:
&quot;Son, that's the way [342] to rekindle a fire, not the stupid,
senseless, thoughtless way you tried to do it!&quot;</P>

great caravan of a thousand carts was travelling from east to west.
And wherever they went, they rapidly consumed all the grass, wood and
greenstuff. Now this caravan had two leaders, each [343] in charge of
five hundred carts. And they thought: &quot;This is a great caravan
of a thousand carts. Wherever we go we use up all the supplies.
Perhaps we should divide the caravan into two groups of five hundred
carts each&quot;, and they did so. Then one of the leaders collected
plenty of grass, wood and water, and set off. After two or three
days' journey he saw a dark red-eyed man coming towards him wearing a
quiver and a wreath of white water-lilies, with his clothes and hair
all wet, driving a donkey-chariot whose wheels were splashed with
mud. On seeing this man, the leader said: &quot;Where do you come
from, sir?&quot; &quot;From such-and-such.&quot; &quot;And where are
you going?&quot; &quot;To so-and-so.&quot; &quot;Has there been much
rainfall in the jungle ahead?&quot; &quot;Oh yes, sir, there has been
a great deal of rain in the jungle ahead of you, the roads are well
watered and there is plenty of grass, [344] wood and water. Throw
away the grass, wood and water you have already got, sir! You will
make rapid progress with lightly-laden carts, so do not tire your
draught-oxen!&quot; The caravan-leader told the carters what the man
had said: &quot;Throw away the grass, wood and water...&quot;, and
they did so. But at the first camping-place they did not find any
grass, wood or water, nor at the second, the third, fourth, fifth,
sixth or seventh, and thus they all came to ruin and destruction. And

away his stocks of grass, wood and water. Then the leader said to the
carters: &quot;This man told us that we should throw away the grass,
wood and water we already have. But he is not one of our friends and
relatives, so why should we trust him? So do not throw away the
grass, wood and water we have; let the caravan continue on its way
with the goods we have brought, and do not throw any of them away!&quot;
The carters agreed and did as he said. And at the first camping-place
they did not find any grass, [346] wood or water, nor at the second,

other caravan that had come to ruin and destruction, and they saw the
bones of those men and cattle that had been gobbled up by the

caravan came to ruin and destruction through the folly of its leader.
