Atanatiya Sutta: The Atanata - Protective Verses</H2>

Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha on Vultures' Peak. And the Four
Great Kings,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote977anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote977sym"><SUP>977</SUP></A></SUP>
with a great array of yakkhas, of gandhabbas, of kumbhandas and of
nagas,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote978anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote978sym"><SUP>978</SUP></A></SUP>
having set up a guard, a defensive force, a watch over the four
quarters,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote979anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote979sym"><SUP>979</SUP></A></SUP>
as night was drawing to a dose, went to see the Lord, lighting up the
entire Vultures' Peak with their radiance, saluted him and sat down
to one side. And some of the yakkhas saluted him and sat down to one
side, some exchanged courtesies with him before sitting down, same
saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan,
and some sat down in silence.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote980anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote980sym"><SUP>980</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. Then sitting to one side, King Vessavana<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote981anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote981sym"><SUP>981</SUP></A></SUP>
said to the Lord: 'Lord, there are some prominent yakkhas who have no
faith in the Blessed Lord, and others who have faith; and likewise
[195] there are yakkhas of middle and lower rank who have no faith in
the Blessed Lord, and others who have faith. But, Lord, the majority
of yakkhas have no faith in the Blessed Lord. Why is this? The
Blessed Lord teaches a code of refraining from taking life, from
taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from lying speech,
and from strong drink and sloth-producing drugs. But the majority of
the yakkhas do not refrain from these things, and to do so is
distasteful and unpleasant to them. Now, Lord, there are disciples of
the Blessed Lord who dwell in remote forest glades, where there is
little noise or shouting, far from the madding crowd, hidden from
people, suitable for retreat. And there are prominent yakkhas living
there who have no faith in the word of the Blessed Lord. In order to
give these folk confidence, may the Blessed Lord learn<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote982anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote982sym"><SUP>982</SUP></A></SUP>
the Atanata protective verses, by means of which monks and nuns, male
and female lay-followers may dwell guarded, protected, unharmed and
at their ease?' And the Lord consented by silence.</P>

these Atanata protective verses:</P>
