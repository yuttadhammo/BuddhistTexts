Potthapada Sutta: About Potthapada - States of Consciousness</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[178] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, in
Jeta's grove, in Anathapindika's park. And at that time the wanderer
Potthapada was at the debating-hall near the Tinduka tree, in the
single-halled park of Queen Mallika,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote194anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote194sym"><SUP>194</SUP></A></SUP>
with a large crowd of about three hundred wanderers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. Then the Lord, rising early, took his robe and bowl and went to
Savatthi for alms. But it occurred to him: 'It is too early to go to
Savatthi for alms. Suppose I were to go to the debating-hall to see
the wanderer Potthapada?' And he did so.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. There Potthapada was sitting with his crowd of wanderers, all
shouting and making a great commotion, indulging in various kinds of
unedifying conversation, such as about kings, robbers, ministers,
armies, dangers, wars, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands,
perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns and cities, [179]
countries, women, heroes, street- and well-gossip, talk of the
departed, desultory chat, speculations about land and sea, talk of
being and non-being.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. But Potthapada saw the Lord coming from a distance, and so he
called his followers to order, saying: 'Be quiet, gentlemen, don't
make a noise, gentlemen! That ascetic Gotama is coming, and he likes
quiet and speaks in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is
quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us.' At this the
wanderers fell silent.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. Then the Lord came to Potthapada, who said: 'Come, reverend Lord,
welcome, reverend Lord! At last the reverend Lord has gone out of his
way to come here. Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
The Lord sat down on the prepared seat, and Potthapada hook a low
stool and sat down to one side. The Lord said:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Potthapada, what were you all talking about? What conversation have
I interrupted?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. Potthapada replied: 'Lord, never mind the conversation we were
having just now, it will not be difficult for the Lord to hear about
that later. In the past few days, Lord, the discussion among the
ascetics and Brahmins of various schools, sitting together and
meeting in the debating-hall, has concerned [180] the higher
extinction of consciousness,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote195anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote195sym"><SUP>195</SUP></A></SUP>
and how this takes place. Some said: &quot;One's perceptions arise
and cease without cause or condition. When they arise, one is
conscious, when they cease, then one is unconscious.&quot; That is
how they explained it. But somebody else said: &quot;No, that is not
how it is. Perceptions<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote196anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote196sym"><SUP>196</SUP></A></SUP>
are a person's self, which comes and goes. When it comes, one is
conscious, when it goes, one is unconscious.&quot; Another said:
&quot;That is not how it is. There are ascetics and Brahmins of great
powers, of great influence. They draw down consciousness into a man
and withdraw it. When they draw it down into him, he is conscious,
when they withdraw it, he is unconscious.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote197anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote197sym"><SUP>197</SUP></A></SUP>
And another said: &quot;No, that is not how it is. There are deities
of great powers, of great influence. They draw down consciousness
into a man and withdraw it. When they draw it down into him, he is
conscious, when they withdraw it, he is unconscious.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote198anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote198sym"><SUP>198</SUP></A></SUP>
It was in this connection that I thought of the Lord: &quot;Ah,
surely, the Blessed Lord, the Well-Farer, he is supremely skilled<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote199anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote199sym"><SUP>199</SUP></A></SUP>
about these matters! The Blessed Lord well understands the higher
extinction of consciousness.&quot; What then, Lord, is this higher
extinction of consciousness?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. 'In this matter, Potthapada, those ascetics and Brahmins who say
one's perceptions arise and cease without cause or condition are
totally wrong. Why is that? One's perceptions arise and cease [181]
owing to a cause and conditions. Some perceptions arise through
training, and some pass away through training.' 'What is this
training?', the Lord said. 'Potthapada, a Tathagata arises in this
world an Arahant, fullyenlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and
conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of
men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.
He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this
world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He
preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
displays the fullyperfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes
forth and practises the moralities (Sutta 2, verses 41-62). That for
him is morality.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. 'And then, Potthapada, that monk who is perfected in morality sees
no danger from any side... (as Sutta 2, verse 63). In this way he is
perfected in morality.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9-10. He guards the sense-doors, etc. (Sutta 2, verses 64-75). [182]
Having reached the first jhana, he remains in it. And whatever
sensations of lust that he previously had disappear. At that time
there is present a true but subtle perception of delight and
happiness,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote200anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote200sym"><SUP>200</SUP></A></SUP>
born of detachment, and he becomes one who is conscious of this
delight and happiness. In this way some perceptions arise through
training, and some pass away through training. And this is that
training', said the Lord.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
11. 'Again, a monk, with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by
gaining inner tranquillity and unity of mind, reaches and remains in
the second jhana, which is free from thinking and pondering, born of
concentration, filled with delight and happiness. His former true but
subtle perception of delight and happiness born of detachment
vanishes. At that time there arises a true but subtle perception
[183] of delight and happiness born of concentration, and he becomes
one who is conscious of this delight and happiness. In this way some
perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through
training.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
12. 'Again, after the fading away of delight he dwells in equanimity,
mindful and clearly aware, and he experiences in his body that
pleasant feeling of which the Noble Ones say: &quot;Happy dwells the
man of equanimity and mindfulness&quot;, and he reaches and remains
in the third jhana. His former true but subtle sense of delight and
happiness born of concentration vanishes, and there arises at that
time a true but subtle sense of equanimity and happiness, and he
becomes one who is conscious of this true but subtle sense of
equanimity and happiness. In this way some perceptions arise through
training, and some pass away through training.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
13. 'Again, with the abandonment of pleasure and pain, and with the
disappearance of previous joy and grief, he reaches and remains in
the fourth jhana, a state beyond pleasure and pain, purified by
equanimity and mindfulness. His former true but subtle sense of
equanimity and happiness vanishes, and there arises a true but subtle
sense of neither happiness nor unhappiness, and he becomes one who is
conscious of this true but subtle sense of neither happiness nor
unhappiness. In this way some perceptions arise through training, and
some pass away through training.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
14. 'Again, by passing entirely beyond bodily sensations, by the
disappearance of all sense of resistance and by non-attraction to the
perception of diversity, seeing that space is infinite, he reaches
and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Space. In this way some
perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through
training.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
15. 'Again, by passing entirely beyond [184] the Sphere of Infinite
Space, seeing that consciousness is infinite, he reaches and remains
in the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness. In this way some perceptions
arise through training, and some pass away through training.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
16. 'Again, by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite
Consciousness, seeing that there is no thing, he reaches and remains
in the Sphere of No-Thingness, and he becomes one who is conscious of
this true but subtle perception of the Sphere of No-Thingness. In
this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away
through training. And this is that training', said the Lord.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
17. 'Potthapada, from the moment when a monk has gained this
controlled perception'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote201anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote201sym"><SUP>201</SUP></A></SUP>
he proceeds from stage to stage till he reaches the limit of
perception. When he has reached the limit of perception it occurs to
him: &quot;Mental activity is worse for me, lack of mental activity
is better. If I were to think and imagine,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote202anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote202sym"><SUP>202</SUP></A></SUP>
these perceptions [that I have attained would cease, and coarser
perceptions would arise in me. Suppose I were not to think or
imagine?&quot; So he neither thinks nor imagines. And then, in him,
just these perceptions arise, but other, coarser perceptions do not
arise. He attains cessation. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
And that, Potthapada, is the way in which the cessation of perception
is brought about by successive steps.</P>

18. What do you think, Potthapada? Have you heard of this before?'
'No, Lord. As I understand it, the Lord has said:

&quot;Potthapada, from the moment when a monk has gained this

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
19. 'Lord, do you teach that the summit of perception is just one, or
that it is many?' 'I teach it as both one and many.'</P>

'Lord, how is it one, and how is it many?' 'According as he attains
successively to the cessation of each perception, so I teach the
summit of that perception: thus I teach both one summit of
perception, and I also teach many.'</P>

20. 'Lord, does perception arise before knowledge, or knowledge arise
before perception, or do both arise simultaneously?' 'Perception
arises first, Potthapada, then knowledge, and from the arising of
perception comes the arising of knowledge. And one knows: &quot;Thus
conditioned, knowledge arises.&quot; In this way you can see how
perception arises first, and then knowledge, and that from the
arising of perception comes the arising of knowledge.’<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote203anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote203sym"><SUP>203</SUP></A></SUP></P>

the four elements, and feeding on solid food.' 'But with such a gross
self, Potthapada, perception would be one thing, and the self
another. You can see that in this way. Given such a gross self,
certain perceptions would arise in a person, and others pass away. In

another.’<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote206anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote206sym"><SUP>206</SUP></A></SUP></P>

'Potthapada, that is not conducive to the purpose, not conducive to
Dhamma, [189] not the way to embark on the holy life; it does not
lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to

not declared it.'</P>

31. Then the wanderers, as soon as the Lord had left, reproached,
sneered and jeered at Potthapada from all sides, saying: 'Whatever
the ascetic Gotama says, Potthapada agrees with him: &quot;So it is,
Lord, so it is, Well-Farer!&quot; We don't understand a word of the
ascetic Gotama's whole discourse: &quot;Is the world eternal or not?
- Is it finite or infinite? - Is the soul the same as the body or
different? - Does the Tathagata exist after death or not, [19o] or
both, or neither?&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Potthapada replied: 'I don't understand either about whether the
world is eternal or not ... or whether the Tathagata exists after
death or not, or both, or neither. But the ascetic Gotama teaches a
true and real way of practice which is consonant with Dhamma and
grounded in Dhamma. And why should not a man like me express approval
of such a true and real practice, so well taught by the ascetic
Gotama?'</P>

32. Two or three days later, Citta, the son of the elephanttrainer,
went with Potthapada to see the Lord. Citta prostrated himself before
the Lord and sat down to one side. Potthapada exchanged courtesies
with the Lord, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.

a night or day that was entirely happy?&quot; and they replied: &quot;No.&quot;

happy world might be brought about?&quot; and they replied: &quot;No.&quot;
I said: &quot;Have you heard the voices of deities who have been
reborn in an entirely happy world, saying: 'The attainment of an

tranquillity, mindfulness and clear awareness - and that is a happy
