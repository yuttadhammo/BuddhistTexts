Subha Sutta: About Subha - Morality, Concentration, Wisdom</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[204] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote215anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote215sym"><SUP>215</SUP></A></SUP>
Once the Venerable Ananda was staying at Savatthi, in Jeta's grove,
in Anathapindika's park, shortly after the Lord's final passing.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote216anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote216sym"><SUP>216</SUP></A></SUP>
And at that time the youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote217anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote217sym"><SUP>217</SUP></A></SUP>
was staying at Savatthi on some business.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.2. And Subha said to a certain young man: 'Go, my lad, to where the
ascetic Ananda is, ask him in my name if he is in good health, free
from fatigue, strong, vigorous and dwelling in comfort, and say: &quot;It
would be good if the Reverend Ananda would, out of compassion, visit
the dwelling of Subha the son of Todeyya.&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.3 'Very good, sir', replied the young man. Then he went to the
Venerable Ananda, exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down to one
side. Then he delivered [205] the message.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.4. The Venerable Ananda replied: 'It is not the right time, young
man. Today I have taken some medicine. Perhaps it will be possible to
come tomorrow when the time and the occasion are suitable.' And the
young man rose, returned to Subha and reported what had passed
between him and the Venerable Ananda, adding: 'My mission has been
thus far accomplished, that the Reverend Ananda will probably take
the opportunity to come tomorrow.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.5. And indeed, as that night was ending, the Venerable Ananda
dressed in the early morning, took his robe and bowl and, accompanied
by the Venerable Cetaka,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote218anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote218sym"><SUP>218</SUP></A></SUP>
came to Subha's dwelling, and sat down on the prepared seat. Then
Subha approached the Venerable Ananda, exchanged courtesies with him,
and sat down to one side. Then he said: [206] 'The Reverend Ananda
was for a long time the Reverend Gotama's personal attendant,
dwelling in his presence and near him. You, Reverend Ananda, would
know what things the Reverend Gotama praised, and with which he
aroused, exhorted and established people. Which, Reverend Ananda,
were those things?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.6. 'Subha, there were three divisions of things which the Lord
praised, and with which he aroused, exhorted and established people.
Which three? The division of Ariyan morality,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote219anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote219sym"><SUP>219</SUP></A></SUP>
the division of Ariyan concentration, and the division of Ariyan
wisdom. These were the three divisions of things which the Lord
praised...'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Well, Reverend Ananda, what is the division of Ariyan morality which
the Reverend Gotama praised ...?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.7-29. 'Young sir, a Tathagata arises in the world, an Arahant,
fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct,
Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be
tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He,
having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world
with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He
preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes
forth and practises the moralities, etc. (Sutta 2, verses 41-63).
Thus a monk is perfected in morality.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.30. 'That is the division of Ariyan morality which the Lord praised
... But something more remains to be done.' 'It is wonderful,
Reverend Ananda, it is marvellous! This division of Ariyan morality
is perfectly fulfilled, not left incomplete. And I do not see this
division of Ariyan morality [207] fulfilled thus anywhere among the
ascetics and Brahmins of other schools. And if any of them were to
have found this perfection in themselves, they would have been so
delighted that they would have said: &quot;We've done enough! The
goal of our asceticism has been reached! There's nothing more to be
done!&quot; And yet the Reverend Ananda declares that there is more
to be done!'</P>

2.2-18. 'And how is a monk guardian of the sense-doors? He guards the
sense-doors and attains the four jhanas (Sutta 2, verses 64-82). This
comes to him through concentration. [208]</P>

the Reverend Gotama praised?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.21-22. 'And so, with mind concentrated he attains various insights
(Sutta 2, verses 83-84). That is known to him,by wisdom.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">

cessation o f the corruptions (Sutta 2, verses 85-97). And he knows:
&quot;...There is nothing further here.&quot;</P>

2.37. 'That is the division of Ariyan wisdom which the Lord praised,

there is nothing to be done.' [210]</P>

Ariyan wisdom is perfectly fulfilled, not left incomplete. And I do
not see this division of Ariyan wisdom fulfilled thus anywhere among
the ascetics and Brahmins of other schools. And there is nothing
further to be done! Excellent, Reverend Ananda, excellent! It is as
if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out
the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark
place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the
Reverend Ananda has expounded the Dhamma in various ways.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Reverend Ananda, I go for refuge to the Lord Gotama, the Dhamma and
the Sangha. May the Reverend Ananda accept me as a lay-follower who
has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last!'</P>
