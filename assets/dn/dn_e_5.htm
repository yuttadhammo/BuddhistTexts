Kutadanta Sutta: About Kutadanta - A Bloodless Sacrifice</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[127] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was travelling through
Magadha with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he
arrived at a Brahmin village called Khanumata. And there he stayed at
the Ambalatthika park.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote160anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote160sym"><SUP>160</SUP></A></SUP>
Now at that time the Brahmin Kutadanta was living at Khanumata, a
populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been
given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and
with royal powers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
And Kutadanta planned a great sacrifice: seven hundred bulls, seven
hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred he-goats and
seven hundred rams were all tied up to the sacrificial posts.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote161anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote161sym"><SUP>161</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. And the Brahmins and householders of Khanumata heard say: 'The
ascetic Gotama ... is staying at Ambalatthika. And concerning that
Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has been spread about: &quot;This
Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fullyenlightened Buddha, perfected in
knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled
Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a
Blessed Lord.&quot; [128] He proclaims this world with its gods,
maras and Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its
princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He
teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. And
indeed it is good to see such Arahants.' And at that the Brahmins and
householders, leaving Khanumata in great numbers, went to
Ambalatthika.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Just then, Kutadanta had gone up to his verandah for his midday
rest. Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for
Ambalatthika, he asked his steward the reason. The steward replied:
'Sir, it is the ascetic Gotama, concerning whom a good report has
been spread about: &quot;This Blessed Lord is an Arahant,... a
Buddha, a Blessed Lord&quot;. That is why they are going to see him.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. Then Kutadanta thought: 'I have heard that the ascetic Gotama
understands how to conduct successfully the triple sacrifice with its
sixteen requisites. Now I do not understand all this, but I want to
make a big sacrifice. Suppose [129] I were to go to the ascetic
Gotama and ask him about the matter.' So he sent his steward to the
Brahmins and householders of Khanumata to ask them to wait for him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. And at that time several hundred Brahmins were staying at
Khanumata intending to take part in Kutadanta's sacrifice. Hearing of
his intention to visit the ascetic Gotama, they went and asked him if
this were true. 'So it is, gentlemen, I am going to visit the ascetic
Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. 'Sir, do not visit the ascetic Gotama... (exactly the same
arguments as at Sutta 4, verse 5). [130-131] This being so, it is not
proper that the Reverend Kutadanta should visit the ascetic Gotama,
but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. Then Kutadanta said to the Brahmins: 'Now listen, gentlemen, as to
why it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama, and why it is
not fitting for him to visit us... (exactly the same as Sutta 4,
verse 6). [132-133] The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Khanumata and
is staying at Ambalatthika. And whatever ascetics or Brahmins come to
our territory are our guests ... He is beyond all praise.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. On hearing this, the Brahmins said: 'Sir, since you praise the
ascetic Gotama so much, then even if he were to live a hundred
yojanas from here, it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go
with a shoulder-bag to visit him. And, sir, we shall all go to visit
the ascetic Gotama.' And so Kutadanta went with a large company of
Brahmins to Ambalatthika. He approached the Lord, [134] exchanged
courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. Some of the Brahmins
and householders of Khanumata made obeisance to the Lord, some
exchanged courtesies with him, some saluted him with joined palms,
some announced their name and clan, and some sat down to one side in
silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9. Sitting to one side, Kutadanta addressed the Lord: 'Reverend
Gotama, I have heard that you understand how to conduct successfully
the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisites. Now I do not
understand all this, but I want to make a big sacrifice. It would be
well if the ascetic Gotama were to explain this to me.' 'Then listen,
Brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will explain.' 'Yes, sir', said
Kutadanta, and the Lord said:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
10. 'Brahmin, once upon a time there was a king called Mahavijita.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote162anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote162sym"><SUP>162</SUP></A></SUP>
He was rich, of great wealth and resources, with an abundance of gold
and silver, of possessions and requisites, of money and money's
worth, with a full treasury and granary. And when King Mahavijita was
musing in private, the thought came to him: &quot;I have acquired
extensive wealth in human terms, I occupy a wide extent of land which
I have conquered. Suppose now I were to make a great sacrifice which
would be to my benefit and happiness for a long time?&quot; And
calling his minister-chaplain,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote163anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote163sym"><SUP>163</SUP></A></SUP>
he told him his thought. [135] &quot;I want to make a big sacrifice.
Instruct me, Reverend Sir, how this may be to my lasting benefit and
happiness.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
11. 'The chaplain replied: &quot;Your Majesty's country is beset by
thieves, it is ravaged, villages and towns are being destroyed, the
countryside is infested with brigands. If Your Majesty were to tax
this region, that would be the wrong thing to do. Suppose Your
Majesty were to think: 'I will get rid of this plague of robbers by
executions and imprisonment, or by confiscation, threats and
banishment', the plague would not be properly ended. Those who
survived would later harm Your Majesty's realm. However, with this
plan you can completely eliminate the plague. To those in the kingdom
who are engaged in cultivating crops and raising cattle, let Your
Majesty distribute grain and fodder; to those in trade, give capital;
to those in government service assign proper living wages. Then those
people, being intent on their own occupations, will not harm the
kingdom. Your Majesty's revenues will be great, the land will be
tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people, with joy in their
hearts, will play with their children, and will dwell in open
houses.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'And saying: &quot;So be it!&quot;, the king accepted the chaplain's
advice: he gave grain and fodder, capital to those in trade,...
proper living wages ... and the people with joy in their hearts
...dwelt in open houses.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
12. 'Then King Mahavijita sent for the chaplain and said: &quot;I
have got rid of the plague of robbers; following your plan my revenue
has grown, the land is tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the
people with joy in their hearts play with their children and dwell in
open houses. Now I wish to make a great sacrifice. Instruct me as to
how this may be done to my lasting benefit and happiness.&quot; &quot;For
this, Sire, you should send for your Khattiyas from town and country,
your advisers and counsellors, the most influential Brahmins and the
wealthy householders of your realm, and say to them: 'I wish to make
a great sacrifice. Assist me in this, gentlemen, that it may be to my
lasting benefit and happiness.&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'The King agreed, and [137] did so. &quot;Sire, let the sacrifice
begin, now is the time, Your Majesty. These four assenting groups<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote164anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote164sym"><SUP>164</SUP></A></SUP>
will be the accessories for the sacrifice.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
13. &quot;'King Mahavijita is endowed with eight things. He is
well-born on both sides,... (as Sutta 4, verse 5) of irreproachable
birth. He is handsome,... of no mean appearance. He is rich... with a
full treasury and granary. He is powerful, having a four-branched
army<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote165anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote165sym"><SUP>165</SUP></A></SUP>
that is loyal, dependable, making bright his reputation among his
enemies. He is a faithful giver and host, not shutting his door
against ascetics, Brahmins and wayfarers, beggars and the needy - a
fountain of goodness. He is very learned in what should be learnt. He
knows the meaning of whatever is said, saying: 'This is what that
means.' He is a scholar, accomplished, wise, competent to perceive
advantage in the past, the future or the present.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote166anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote166sym"><SUP>166</SUP></A></SUP>
King Mahavijita is endowed with these eight things. These constitute
the accessories for the sacrifice.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[138] 14. &quot;'The Brahmin chaplain is endowed with four things. He
is well-born ... He is a scholar, versed in the mantras ... He is
virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue. He is
learned, accomplished and wise, and is the first or second to hold
the sacrificial ladle. He has these four qualities. These constitute
the accessories to the sacrifice.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
15. 'Then, prior to the sacrifice, the Brahmin chaplain taught the
King the three modes. &quot;It might be that Your Majesty might have
some regrets about the intended sacrifice: 'I am going to lose a lot
of wealth', or during the sacrifice: 'I am losing a lot of wealth',
or after the sacrifice: 'I have lost a lot of wealth.' In such cases,
Your Majesty should not entertain such regrets.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
16. 'Then, prior to the sacrifice, the chaplain dispelled the King's
qualms with ten conditions for the recipient: &quot;Sire, there will
come to the sacrifice those who take life and those who abstain from
taking life. To those who take life, so will it be to them; but those
who abstain from taking life will have a successful sacrifice and
will rejoice in it, and their hearts may be calmed within. There will
come those who take what is not given and those who refrain..., those
who indulge in sexual misconduct and those who refrain..., those who
tell lies..., indulge in calumny, harsh and frivolous speech...,
[139] those who are covetous and those who are not, those who harbour
ill-will and those who do not, those who have wrong views and those
who have right views. To those who have wrong views it will turn out
accordingly, but those who have right views will have a successful
sacrifice and will rejoice in it, and their hearts may be calmed
within.&quot; So the chaplain dispelled the King's doubts with ten
conditions.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
17. 'So the chaplain instructed the King who was making the great
sacrifice with sixteen reasons, urged him, inspired him and gladdened
his heart. &quot;Someone might say: 'King Mahavijita is making a
great sacrifice, but he has not invited his Khattiyas..., his
advisers and counsellors, the most influential Brahmins and wealthy
householders...' But such words would not be in accordance with the
truth, since the King has invited them. Thus the King may know that
he will have a successful sacrifice and rejoice in it, and his heart
will be calmed within. Or someone might say: 'King Mahavijita is
making a great sacrifice, but he is not well-born on both
sides...'[140] But such words would not be in accordance with the
truth ...Or someone might say: 'His chaplain is not
well-born...'[141] But such words would not be in accordance with the
truth.&quot; Thus the chaplain instructed the King with sixteen
reasons...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
18. 'In this sacrifice, Brahmin, no bulls were slain, no goats or
sheep, no cocks and pigs, nor were various living beings subjected to
slaughter, nor were trees cut down for sacrificial posts, nor were
grasses mown for the sacrificial grass, and those who are called
slaves or servants or workmen did not perform their tasks for fear of
blows or threats, weeping and in tears. But those who wanted to do
something did it, those who did not wish to did not: they did what
they wanted to do, and not what they did not want to do. The
sacrifice was carried out with ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey and
molasses. [142]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
19. 'Then, Brahmin, the Khattiyas..., the ministers and counsellors,
the influential Brahmins, the wealthy householders of town and
country, having received a sufficient income, came to King Mahavijita
and said: &quot;We have brought sufficient wealth, Your Majesty,
please accept it.&quot; &quot;But, gentlemen, I have collected
together sufficient wealth. Whatever is left over, you take away.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'At the King's refusal, they went away to one side and consulted
together: &quot;It is not right for us to take this wealth back to
our own homes. The King is making a great sacrifice. Let us follow
his example.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
20. 'Then the Khattiyas put their gifts to the east of the
sacrificial pit, the advisers and counsellors set out theirs to the
south, the Brahmins to the west and the wealthy householders to the
north. And in this sacrifice no bulls were slain,... nor were living
beings subjected to slaughter ... Those who wanted to do something
did it, those who did not wish to did not... The sacrifice was
carried out with ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey and molasses.[143]
Thus there were the four assenting groups, and King Mahavijita was
endowed with eight things, and the chaplain with four things in three
modes. This, Brahmin, is called the sixteenfold successful sacrifice
in three modes.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
21. At this the Brahmins shouted loudly and noisily: 'What a splendid
sacrifice! What a splendid way to perform a sacrifice!' But Kutadanta
sat in silence. And the Brahmins asked him why he did not applaud the
ascetic Gotama's fine words. He replied: 'It is not that I do not
applaud them. My head would split open if I did not.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote167anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote167sym"><SUP>167</SUP></A></SUP>
But it strikes me that the ascetic Gotama does not say: &quot;I have
heard this&quot;, or &quot;It must have been like this&quot;, but he
says: &quot;It was like this or like that at the time.&quot; And so,
gentlemen, it seems to me that the ascetic Gotama must have been at
that time either King Mahavijita, the lord of the sacrifice, or else
the Brahmin chaplain who conducted the sacrifice for him. Does the
Reverend Gotama acknowledge that he performed, or caused to be
performed, such a sacrifice, and that in consequence at death, after
the breaking-up of the body, he was reborn in a good sphere, a
heavenly state?' 'I do, Brahmin. I was the Brahmin chaplain who
conducted that sacrifice.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
22. 'And, Reverend Gotama, is there any other sacrifice that is
simpler, less difficult, more fruitful and profitable than this
threefold sacrifice with its sixteen attributes?'[144] 'There is,
Brahmin.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'What is it, Reverend Gotama?' 'Wherever regular family gifts are
given to virtuous ascetics, these constitute a sacrifice more
fruitful and profitable than that.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
23. 'Why, Reverend Gotama, and for what reason is this better?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Brahmin, no Arahants or those who have attained the Arahant path
will attend such a sacrifice. Why? Because there they see beatings
and throttlings, so they do not attend. But they will attend the
sacrifice at which regular family gifts are given to virtuous
ascetics, because there there are no beatings or throttlings. That is
why this kind of sacrifice is more fruitful and profitable.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
24. 'But, Reverend Gotama, is there any other sacrifice that is more
profitable than[145] either of these?' 'There is, Brahmin.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'What is it, Reverend Gotama?' 'Brahmin, if anyone provides shelter
for the Sangha coming from the four quarters, that constitutes a more
profitable sacrifice.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
25. 'But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice that is more
profitable than these three?' 'There is, Brahmin.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'What is it, Reverend Gotama?' 'Brahmin, if anyone with a pure heart
goes for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, that
constitutes a sacrifice more profitable than [146] any of these
three.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
26. 'But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice that is more
profitable than these four?' 'There is, Brahmin.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'What is it, Reverend Gotama?' 'Brahmin, if anyone with a pure heart
undertakes the precepts - to refrain from taking life, from taking
what is not given, from sexual immorality, from lying speech and from
taking strong drink and slothproducing drugs - that constitutes a
sacrifice more profitable than any of these four.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
27. 'But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice that is more
profitable than these five?' 'There is, Brahmin.' [147]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'What is it, Reverend Gotama?' 'Brahmin, a Tathagata arises in this
world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and
conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of
men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.
He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this
world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He
preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes
forth and practises the moralities, etc. (Sutta 2, verses 41-74).
Thus a monk is perfected in morality. He attains the four jhanas
(Sutta 2, verses 75-82). That, Brahmin, is a sacrifice ...more
profitable. He attains various insights (Sutta 2, verse 83-95), and
the cessation of the corruptions (Sutta 2, verse 97). He knows:
&quot;There is nothing further in this world.&quot; That, Brahmin, is
a sacrifice that is simpler, less difficult, more fruitful and more
profitable than all the others. And beyond this there is no sacrifice
that is greater and more perfect.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
28. 'Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent! It is as if someone were
to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one
who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that
those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Reverend Gotama
has expounded the Dhamma in various ways, May the Reverend Gotama
accept me as a lay-follower from this day forth as long as life shall
last! And, [148] Reverend Gotama, I set free the seven hundred bulls,
seven hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred he-goats
and seven hundred rams. I grant them life, let them be fed with green
grass and given cool water to drink, and let cool breezes play upon
them.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
29. Then the Lord delivered a graduated discourse to Kutadanta, on
generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing the danger,
degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of
renunciation. And when the Lord knew that Kutadanta's mind was ready,
pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm, then he preached
a sermon on Dhamma in brief: on suffering, its origin, its cessation,
and the path. And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have
been removed receives the dye perfectly, so in the Brahmin Kutadanta,
as he sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye, and he
knew: 'Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
30. Then Kutadanta, having seen, attained, experienced and penetrated
the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended uncertainty,
having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher's doctrine without
relying on others, said: 'May the Reverend Gotama and his order of
monks accept a meal from me tomorrow!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
The Lord assented by silence. Then Kutadanta, seeing his consent,
rose, saluted the Lord, passed by to his right and departed. As day
was breaking, he caused hard and soft food to be prepared at his
place of sacrifice, and when it was ready he announced: 'Reverend
Gotama, it is time; the meal is ready.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
And the Lord, having risen early, went with robe and bowl and
attended by his monks to Kutadanta's place of sacrifice and sat down
on the prepared seat. And Kutadanta [1491 served the Buddha and his
monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were
satisfied. And when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from
the bowl, Kutadanta took a low stool and sat down to one side.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
Then the Lord, having instructed Kutadanta with a talk on Dhamma,
inspired him, fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him, rose from
his seat and departed.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote168anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote168sym"><SUP>168</SUP></A></SUP></P>
