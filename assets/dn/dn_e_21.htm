Sakkapanha Sutta: Sakka's Questions - A God Consults the Buddha 
</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[263] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote569anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote569sym"><SUP>569</SUP></A></SUP>
Once the Lord was staying in Magadha, to the east of Rajagaha, by a
Brahmin village called Ambasanda, to the north of the village on
Mount Vediya, in the Indasala Cave.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote570anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote570sym"><SUP>570</SUP></A></SUP>
And at that time Sakka, lord of the gods,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote571anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote571sym"><SUP>571</SUP></A></SUP>
felt a strong desire to see the Lord. And Sakka thought: 'Where is
the Blessed Lord, the fully-enlightened Buddha, now staying?' Then,
perceiving where the Lord was, Sakka said to the Thirty-Three Gods:
'Gentlemen, the Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha... in the Indasala
Cave. How would it be if we were to go and visit the Lord?' 'Very
good, Lord, and may good fortune go with you', replied the
Thirty-Three Gods.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.2. Then Sakka said to Pancasikha of the gandhabbas: [264] 'The
Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha ... in the Indasala Cave. I
propose to go to visit him.' 'Very good, Lord', said Pancasikha and,
taking his yellow beluva-wood lute,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote572anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote572sym"><SUP>572</SUP></A></SUP>
he followed in attendance on Sakka. And, just as swiftly as a strong
man might stretch forth his flexed arm, or flex it again, Sakka,
surrounded by the Thirty-Three Gods and attended by Pancasikha,
vanished from the heaven of the Thirty-Three and appeared in
Magadha...on Mount Vediya.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.3. Then a tremendous light shone over Mount Vediya, illuminating
the village of Ambasanda - so great was the power of the gods - so
that in the surrounding villages they were saying: 'Look, Mount
Vediya is on fire today - it's burning - it's in flames! What is the
matter, that Mount Vediya and Ambasanda are lit up like this?' and
they y were so terrified that their hair stood on end.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.4. Then Sakka said: 'Pancasikha, [265] it is hard for the likes of
us to get near the Tathagatas when they are enjoying the bliss of
meditation,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote573anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote573sym"><SUP>573</SUP></A></SUP>
and therefore withdrawn. But if you, Pancasikha, were first to
attract<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote574anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote574sym"><SUP>574</SUP></A></SUP>
the ear of the Blessed Lord, then we might afterwards be able to
approach and see the Blessed Lord, the fully-enlightened Buddha.'
'Very good, Lord', said Pancasikha and, taking his yellow beluva-wood
lute, he approached the Indasala Cave. Thinking: 'As far as this is
neither too far nor too near to the Lord, and he will hear my voice',
he stood to one side. Then, to the strains of his lute, he sang these
verses extolling the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Arahants, and love:<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote575anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote575sym"><SUP>575</SUP></A></SUP></P>

1.6. When he heard this, the Lord said: 'Pancasikha, the sound of
your strings blends so well with your song, and your song with the
strings, that neither prevails excessively over the other.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote580anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote580sym"><SUP>580</SUP></A></SUP>
When did you compose these verses on the Buddha, the Dhamma, the
Arahants, and love?' 'Lord, it was when the Blessed Lord was staying
on the bank of the River Neranjara, under the goatherd's banyan tree
[268] prior to his enlightenment. At that time I fell in love with
the lady Bhadda, bright as the sun, the daughter of King Timbaru of
the gandhabbas. But the lady was in love with somebody else. It was
Sikhaddi, the son of Matali the charioteer, whom she favoured. And
when I found that I could not win the lady by any manner of means, I
took my yellow beluva-wood lute and went to the home of King Timbaru
of the gandhabbas, and there I sang these verses:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.7. (Verses as 5). 'And, Lord, having heard the verses the lady
Bhadda Suriyavaccasa said to me: &quot;Sir, I have not personally
seen that Blessed Lord, though I heard of him when I went to the
Sudhamma Hall of the Thirty-Three Gods to dance. And since, sir, you
praise that Blessed Lord so highly, let us meet today.&quot; [269]
And so, Lord, I met the lady, not then but later.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.8. Then Sakka thought: 'Pancasikha and the Lord are in friendly
conversation', so he called to Pancasikha: 'My dear Pancasikha,
salute the Blessed Lord from me, saying: &quot;Lord, Sakka, king of
the gods, together with his ministers and followers, pays homage at
the feet of the Blessed Lord.&quot;' 'Very good, Lord', said
Pancasikha, and did so.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Pancasikha, may Sakka, king of the gods, his ministers and followers
be happy, for they all desire happiness: devas, humans, asuras,
nagas, gandhabbas, and whatever other groups of beings there are!'
for that is the way the Tathagatas greet such mighty beings. After
this greeting, Sakka entered the Indasala Cave, saluted the Lord, and
stood to one side, and the Thirty-Three Gods, with Pancasikha, did
the same.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.9. Then in the Indasala Cave the rough passages became smooth, the
narrow parts became wide, and in the pitch-dark cavern it became
bright, owing to the [270] power of the devas. Then the Lord said to
Sakka: 'It is wonderful, it is marvellous that the Venerable Kosiya,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote581anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote581sym"><SUP>581</SUP></A></SUP>
with so much, so many things to do, should come here!' 'Lord, I have
long wished to visit the Blessed Lord, but I have always been so busy
on behalf of the Thirty-Three that I was unable to come. Once the
Blessed Lord was staying at Savatthi in the Salala hut, and I went to
Savatthi to see the Lord.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.10. 'At that time the Blessed Lord was seated in some form of
meditation, and King Vessavana's wife Bhunjati was waiting on him,
venerating him with palms together. I said to her: &quot;Lady, please
salute the Blessed Lord for me and say: 'Sakka, the king of the gods,
with his ministers and followers, pays homage at the Lord's feet'.
But she said: &quot;Sir, it is not the right time to see the Blessed
Lord, he is in retreat.&quot; [271] &quot;Well then, lady, when the
Blessed Lord rises from his meditation, please tell him what I have
said.&quot; Lord, did the lady salute you on my behalf, and does the
Lord remember what she said?' 'She did salute me, King of the Gods,
and I remember what she said. I also remember that it was the sound
of Your Reverence's chariot-wheels that roused me from my
meditation.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote582anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote582sym"><SUP>582</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
1.11. 'Lord, those gods who arose in the heaven of the ThirtyThree
before I did have told me and assured me that whenever a Tathagata, a
fully-enlightened Arahant Buddha arises in the world, the ranks of
devas increase, and those of the asuras decline in numbers. In fact I
have witnessed this myself. There was, Lord, right here in
Kapilavatthu a Sakyan girl called Gopika who had faith in the Buddha,
the Dhamma and the Sangha, and who observed the precepts
scrupulously. She rejected the status of a woman and developed the
thought of becoming a man. Then, after her death, at the breaking-up
of the body, she went to a happy destination, being reborn in a
heaven-state among the Thirty-Three Gods, as one of our sons,
becoming known as Gopaka the devas' son.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote583anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote583sym"><SUP>583</SUP></A></SUP>
Also, there were three monks who, having observed the holy life under
the Blessed Lord, had been reborn in the inferior condition of
gandhabbas. They lived indulging in the pleasures of the five senses,
as our attendants and servants. At this, Gopaka [272] rebuked them,
saying: &quot;What were you about, sirs, that you did not listen to
the Blessed Lord's teaching? I was a woman who had faith in the
Buddha...1 rejected the status of a woman... and was reborn among the
Thirty-Three Gods and am known as Gopaka the devas' son. But you,
after having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord, have been
reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas! It is a sorry sight
for us to see our fellows in the Dhamma reborn in the inferior
condition of gandhabbas!&quot; And being thus rebuked, two of those
devas immediately developed mindfulness,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote584anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote584sym"><SUP>584</SUP></A></SUP>
and so attained to the Realm of the Retinue of Brahma.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote585anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote585sym"><SUP>585</SUP></A></SUP>
But one of them remained addicted to sensual pleasures.</P>

1.12 
[Gopaka spoke:]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;'Disciple once of Him-Who-Sees, <BR>The name I bore then

<BR>Resplendent; Gopaka my name.<BR>Then former monks I saw, who'd
reached <BR>No higher than gandhabba's rank, <BR>Who before had human
birth <BR>And led the life the Buddha taught. <BR>We supplied their
food and drink <BR>And waited on them in our homes.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote587anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote587sym"><SUP>587</SUP></A></SUP>
[273] <BR>Had they no ears, that they thus blest <BR>Still could not
grasp the Buddha's law? <BR>Each for himself must understand <BR>That
Dhamma taught by Him-Who-Sees, <BR>And well-proclaimed. I, serving
you, <BR>Heard the Noble Ones' good words, <BR>And so I'm born, a

not attained your proper rank, <BR>A sorry sight it is to see <BR>One's
Dhamma-fellows sunk so low <BR>That, gandhabba-spirits, you <BR>But
come to wait upon the gods, <BR>While as for me - I am transformed!

<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
When thus rebuked by Gopaka, <BR>Disciple true of Gotama, <BR>In sore
distress they all replied: <BR>&quot;Alas, let's go, and strive
amain, <BR>And be no longer others' slaves!&quot; [274]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
And of the three, two struggled hard, <BR>And bore in mind the
Teacher's word. <BR>They purified their hearts of lust, <BR>Perceiving
peril in desires, <BR>And like the elephant that bursts <BR>All
restraining bonds, they broke <BR>The fetters and the bonds of lust,
<BR>Those fetters of the evil one <BR>So hard to overcome - and thus
<BR>The very gods, the Thirty-Three, <BR>With Indra and Pajapati,
<BR>Who sat enthroned in Council Hall, <BR>These two heroes, passions
purged, <BR>Outstripped, and left them far behind.</P>

On seeing which, Vasava,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote588anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote588sym"><SUP>588</SUP></A></SUP>
dismayed, <BR>Chief amidst that throng of gods, <BR>Cried: &quot;See
how these of lesser rank <BR>Outstrip the gods, the Thirty-Three!&quot;
<BR>Then hearing of his ruler's fears, <BR>Gopaka said to Vasava:
<BR>&quot;Lord Indra, in the world of men <BR>A Buddha, called the
Sakyan Sage,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote589anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote589sym"><SUP>589</SUP></A></SUP>
<BR>Has gained the mastery of lust, <BR>And these his pupils, who had
failed <BR>In mindfulness when claimed by death, <BR>Have now
regained it with my help. [275] <BR>Though one of them is left behind
<BR>And still among gandhabbas dwells, <BR>These two, on highest
wisdom set, <BR>In deep absorption spurn the gods! <BR>Let no
disciple ever doubt <BR>That truth may yet be realised <BR>By those
who dwell in these abodes.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote590anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote590sym"><SUP>590</SUP></A></SUP></P>

our questions to the Blessed Lord.'</P>

1.13. 
Then the Lord thought: 'Sakka has lived a pure life for a long
time. Whatever questions he may ask will be to the point and not
frivolous, and he will be quick to understand my answers.' So the
Blessed Lord replied to Sakka in this verse:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Ask me, Sakka, all that you desire!<BR>On what you ask, I'll put
your mind at rest.'</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[276] 2.1. Being thus invited, Sakka, ruler of the gods, put his
first question to the Lord: 'By what fetters, sir,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote591anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote591sym"><SUP>591</SUP></A></SUP>
are beings bound - gods, humans, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas and
whatever other kinds there may be - whereby, although they wish to
live without hate, harming, hostility or malignity, and in peace,
they yet live in hate, harming one another, hostile and malign?' This
was Sakka's first question to the Lord, and the Lord replied: 'Ruler
of the Gods, it is the bonds of jealousy and avarice<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote592anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote592sym"><SUP>592</SUP></A></SUP>
that bind beings so that, though they wish to live without hate,...
they yet live in hate, harming one another, hostile and malign.' This
was the Lord's reply, and Sakka, delighted, exclaimed: 'So it is,
Lord, so it is, Well-Farer! Through the Lord's answer I have overcome
my doubt and got rid of uncertainty!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.2. Then Sakka, having [277] expressed his appreciation, asked
another question: 'But sir, what gives rise to jealousy and avarice,
what is their origin, how are they born, how do they arise? Owing to
the presence of what do they arise, owing to the absence of what do
they not arise?' 'Jealousy and avarice, Ruler of the Gods, take rise
from like and dislike,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote593anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote593sym"><SUP>593</SUP></A></SUP>
this is their origin, this is how they are born, how they arise. When
these are present, they arise; when these are absent, they do not
arise.' 'But, sir, what gives rise to like and dislike? ... Owing to
the presence of what do they arise, owing to the absence of what do
they not arise?' 'They arise, Ruler of the Gods, from desire<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote594anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote594sym"><SUP>594</SUP></A></SUP>
Owing to the presence of desire they arise, owing to the absence of

'Desire, Ruler of the Gods, arises from thinking<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote595anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote595sym"><SUP>595</SUP></A></SUP><SPAN LANG="">...

and equanimity.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote600anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote600sym"><SUP>600</SUP></A></SUP>
Why have I declared this in regard to happiness? This is how I
understood happiness: When I observed that in the pursuit of such
happiness, unwholesome factors increased and wholesome factors
decreased, then that happiness was to be avoided. And when I observed
that in the pursuit of such happiness unwholesome factors decreased
and wholesome ones increased, then that happiness was to be sought
after. Now, of such happiness as is accompanied by thinking and
pondering,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote601anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote601sym"><SUP>601</SUP></A></SUP>
and of that which is not so accompanied, the latter is the more
excellent. The same applies to unhappiness, and [279] to equanimity.
And this, Ruler of the Gods, is the practice that monk has undertaken
who has reached the right way... leading to the cessation of the
tendency to proliferation.' And Sakka expressed his delight at the
Lord's answer.</P>

'Ruler of the Gods, I declare that there are two kinds of bodily
conduct: the kind to be pursued, and the kind to be avoided. The same
applies to conduct of speech and to the pursuit of goals. [280] Why
have I declared this in regard to bodily conduct? This is how I
understood bodily conduct: When I observed that by the performance of
certain actions, unwholesome factors increased and wholesome factors
decreased, then that form of bodily action was to be avoided. And
when I observed that by the performance of such actions unwholesome
factors decreased and wholesome ones increased, then such bodily
action was to be followed. That is why I make this distinction. The
same applies to conduct of speech and the pursuit of goals. [281] And
this, Ruler of the Gods, is the practice that monk has undertaken who
has acquired the restraint required by the rules.' And Sakka
expressed his delight at the Lord's answer.</P>

'Ruler of the Gods, I declare that things perceived by the eye are of
two kinds: the kind to be pursued, and the kind to be avoided. The
same applies to things perceived by the ear, the nose, the tongue,
the body and the mind.' At this, Sakka said: 'Lord, I understand in
full the true meaning of what the Blessed Lord has outlined in brief.
Lord, whatever object perceived by the eye, if its pursuit leads to
the increase of unwholesome factors and the decrease of wholesome
ones, that is not to be sought after; if its pursuit leads to the
decrease of unwholesome factors and the increase of wholesome ones,
such an object is [282] to be sought after. And the same applies to
things perceived by the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body and the
mind. Thus I understand in full the true meaning of what the Blessed
Lord has outlined in brief, and thus through the Lord's answer I have
overcome my doubt and got rid of uncertainty.'</P>

2.6. Then Sakka asked another question: 'Sir, do all ascetics and
Brahmins teach the same doctrine, practise the same discipline, want
the same thing<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote603anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote603sym"><SUP>603</SUP></A></SUP>
and pursue the same goal?' 'No, Ruler of the Gods, they do not.&quot;But
why, sir, do they not do so?' 'The world, Ruler of the Gods, is made
up of many and various elements. Such being the case, beings adhere
to one or other of these various things, and whatever they adhere to
they become powerfully addicted to, and declare: 'This alone is the
truth, everything else is false!' Therefore they do not all teach the
same doctrine, practise the same discipline, want the same thing,
pursue the same goal.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Sir, are all ascetics and Brahmins fully [283] proficient, freed
from bonds, perfect in the holy life, have they perfectly reached the
goal?' 'No, Ruler of the Gods.' 'Why is that, sir?' 'Only those,
Ruler of the Gods, who are liberated by the destruction of craving
are fully proficient, freed from the bonds, perfect in the holy life,
and have perfectly reached the goal.' And Sakka rejoiced at the
answer as before.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2.7. Then Sakka said: 'Passion,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote604anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote604sym"><SUP>604</SUP></A></SUP>
sir, is a disease, a boil, a dart. It seduces a man, drawing him into
this or that state of becoming, so that he is reborn in high states
or low. Whereas other ascetics and Brahmins of differing viewpoints
gave me no chance to ask these questions, the Lord has instructed me
at length, and thus removed the dart of doubt and uncertainty from
me.' [284] 'Ruler of the Gods, do you admit to having asked the same
question of other ascetics and Brahmins?' 'Yes, Lord.' 'Then, if you
don't mind, please tell me what they said.' 'I do not mind telling
the Blessed Lord, or one like him.’<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote605anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote605sym"><SUP>605</SUP></A></SUP>

'Lord, I went to those I considered to be ascetics and Brahmins
because of their solitary life in the woods, and I put these
questions to them. But instead of giving me a proper answer,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote606anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote606sym"><SUP>606</SUP></A></SUP>
they asked me in return: &quot;Who are you, Venerable Sir?&quot; I
replied that I was Sakka, ruler of the gods, and they asked me what
had brought me there. Then I taught them the Dhamma as far as I had
heard it and practised it. But they were very pleased with even that
much, and they said: &quot;We have seen Sakka, the ruler of the gods,
and he has answered the questions we put to him!&quot; And they
became my pupils instead of my becoming theirs. But I, Lord, am a
disciple of the Blessed Lord, a Stream-Winner, not subject to rebirth
in states of woe, firmly established and destined for full
enlightenment.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote607anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote607sym"><SUP>607</SUP></A></SUP>
'Ruler of the Gods, do you admit to having ever previously
experienced rejoicing and happiness such as you experience now?'
[285] 'Yes, Lord.' 'And what was that about?' 'In the past, Lord, war
had broken out between the gods and the asuras, and the gods had
defeated the asuras. And after the battle, as victor, I thought:
&quot;Whatever is now the food of the gods,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote608anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote608sym"><SUP>608</SUP></A></SUP>
and what is the food of the asuras, henceforth we shall enjoy both.&quot;
But, Lord, such happiness and satisfaction, which was due to blows
and wounds, does not conduce to dispassion, detachment, cessation,
peace, higher knowledge, enlightenment, Nibbana. But that happiness
and satisfaction that is obtained by hearing the Dhamma from the
Blessed Lord, which is not due to blows and wounds, does conduce to
dispassion, detachment, cessation, peace, higher knowledge,
enlightenment, Nibbana.'</P>
