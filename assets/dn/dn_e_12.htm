Lohicca Sutta: About Lohicca - Good and Bad Teachers</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[224] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a
large company of some five hundred monks, and, coming to Salavatika,
he stayed there. And at that time the Brahmin Lohicca was living at
Salavatika, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn,
which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal
gift and with royal powers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. Just then this evil line of reasoning occurred to Lohicca:
'Suppose an ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote233anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote233sym"><SUP>233</SUP></A></SUP>
having done so, he ought not to declare it to anyone else; for what
can one man do for another? It is just as if a man, having cut
through an old fetter, were to make a new one. I declare that such a
thing is an evil deed rooted in attachment, for what can one man do
for another?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Then Lohicca heard it said that the ascetic Gotama had arrived at
Salavatika, and that concerning the Blessed Lord Gotama a good report
had been spread about... (as Sutta 4, verse 2). [225] 'And indeed it
is good to see such Arahants.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. And Lohicca said to Bhesika the barber: 'Friend Bhesika, go to the
ascetic Gotama, ask in my name after his health and then say: &quot;May
the Reverend Gotama consent to take tomorrow's meal, with his order
of monks, from the Brahmin Lohicca!&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. 'Very good, sir', said Bhesika, and carried out the errand. The
Lord signified his acceptance by silence.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. Then Bhesika, understanding the Lord's acceptance, rose from his
seat and passed by with his right side to the Lord. He returned to
Lohicca and told him [226] of the Lord's acceptance.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. And Lohicca, as the night was ending, had choice hard and, soft
foods prepared at his own home. Then he sent Bhesika to tell the Lord
that the meal was ready. And the Lord, having risen early and taken
his robe and bowl, went with his order of monks to Salavatika.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. And Bhesika the barber followed the Lord close at hand. And he
said: 'Lord, this evil thought has occurred to the Brahmin Lohicca
... Truly, Lord, this is what the Brahmin Lohicca has been thinking.'
'It may well be so, Bhesika, it may well be so.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9. So the Lord came to Lohicca's dwelling, and sat down on [227] the
prepared seat. Lohicca personally served the Buddha and his order of
monks with choice hard and soft food till they were contented and
satisfied. When the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl, Lohicca
took a low stool and sat down to one side. Then the Lord said to him:
'Lohicca, is it true that an evil line of reasoning has occurred to
you ... (as verse 2)?' 'Yes, Reverend Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
10. 'What do you think, Lohicca? Don't you reside at Salavatika?'
'Yes, Reverend Gotama.' 'Well now, if anyone should say: &quot;The
Brahmin Lohicca resides at Salavatika, and he should enjoy the entire
fruits and revenues of Salavatika, not giving anything away to
others&quot; - would not anyone who spoke like that be a source of
danger to your tenants?' 'He would be a source of danger, Reverend
Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'And as such, would he be solicitous for their welfare or not?' 'He
would not, Reverend Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'And, by not being solicitous for their welfare, would he have a
heart full of love for them, or of hatred?' 'Of hatred, Reverend
Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'And in a heart full of hatred, is there wrong view or right view?'
'Wrong view, Reverend Gotama,' [228]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'But Lohicca, I declare that wrong view leads to one of two destinies
- hell or an animal rebirth.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote234anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote234sym"><SUP>234</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
11. 'What do you think, Lohicca? Does King Pasenadi of Kosala reside
at Kasi-Kosala?' 'He does, Reverend Gotama.' 'Well, if anyone should
say: &quot;King Pasenadi of Kosala resides at Kasi-Kosala, and he
should enjoy the entire fruits and revenues of Kosala, not giving
anything away to others&quot; â€“ would not anyone who spoke like
that be a source of danger to his tenants?... Would he not have a
heart full of hatred... and would that not be wrong view?' 'It would,
Reverend Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
12. 'Then surely, if anyone were to say the same of the Brahmin
Lohicca ... that would be wrong view.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
13. 'In the same way, Lohicca, if anyone should say: &quot;Suppose an
ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine and thought he
ought not to declare it to anyone else, [229] for what can one man do
for another?&quot; he would be a source of danger to those young men
of good family who, following the Dhamma and discipline taught by the
Tathagata, attain to such excellent distinction as to realise the
fruit of Stream-Entry, of Once-Returning, of Non-Returning, of
Arahantship - and to all who ripen the seeds of a rebirth in the
deva-world.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote235anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote235sym"><SUP>235</SUP></A></SUP>
Being a source of danger to them, he is uncompassionate, and his
heart is grounded in hostility, and that constitutes wrong view,
which leads to ... hell or an animal rebirth.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
14. 'And if anyone were to speak thus of King Pasenadi, he would be a
source of danger to the King's tenants, yourself and others...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
15. (as verse 13) [230]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
16. 'Lohicca, these three kinds of teachers in the world are
blameworthy, and if anyone blames such teachers, his blame is proper,
true, in accordance with reality and faultless. Which three? Here,
Lohicca, is a teacher who has gone forth from the household life into
homelessness, but who has not gained the goal of asceticism. And
without having gained this goal, he teaches his disciples a
doctrine,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote236anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote236sym"><SUP>236</SUP></A></SUP>
saying: &quot;This is for your good, this is for your happiness.&quot;
But his pupils don't wish to hear, they don't listen, the don't
arouse the thought of enlightenment, and the teacher's instructions
are flouted. He should be blamed, saying: &quot;This venerable one
has gone forth ..., his instructions are flouted. It is just as if a
man were to persist in making advances to a woman who rejected him,
and to embrace her though she turned away.&quot; This I declare to be
an evil doctrine based on attachment, for what can one man do for
another?<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote237anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote237sym"><SUP>237</SUP></A></SUP>
This is the first teacher who is blameworthy...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
17. 'Again, there is a teacher who has gone forth ... but who has not
gained the goal of asceticism. Without having gained this goal, he
teaches his disciples a doctrine, saying: &quot;This is for your
good, this is for your happiness.&quot; His pupils wish to hear, they
listen, [231] they rouse the thought of enlightenment, and the
teacher's instructions are not flouted. He should be blamed, saying:
&quot;This venerable one has gone forth...&quot; It is as if, leaving
his own field, he should think another's field in need of weeding. I
declare this to be an evil doctrine rooted in attachment ... This is
the second teacher who is blameworthy...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
18. 'Again, there is a teacher who has gone forth... and who has
gained the goal of asceticism. Having gone forth, he reaches ... But
his pupils don't wish to hear him,... his instructions are flouted.
He too should be blamed ... Just as if, having cut through an old
fetter, one were to make a new one, I declare that this is an evil
doctrine rooted in attachment, for what can one man do for another?
This is the third teacher who is blameworthy... [232] And these are
the three kinds of teacher that I spoke of as blameworthy.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
19. Then Lohicca said: 'Reverend Gotama, are there any teachers in
the world who are not blameworthy?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
20-55. 'Here, Lohicca, a Tathagata arises in the world, an Arahant,
fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct,
Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be
tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He,
having realised it by his own superknowledge, proclaims this world
with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He
preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes
forth and practises the moralities, guards the sense-doors, attains
the first jhdna (Sutta 2, verses 41-76). [233] And whenever the pupil
of a teacher attains to such excellent distinction, that is a teacher
who is not to be blamed in the world. And if anyone blames that
teacher, his blame is improper, untrue, not in accordance with
reality, and faulty.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
56-62. 'He attains the other three jhanas (as Sutta 2, verses 77-82)
and various insights (Sutta 2, verses 83-84). Whenever the pupil of a
teacher attains to such excellent distinction, that is a teacher who
is not to be blamed in the world...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
63-77. 'He realises the Four Noble Truths, the path, and the
cessation of the corruptions ... (as Sutta 2, verses 85-97).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Whenever the pupil of a teacher attains to such excellent
distinction, that is a teacher who [234] is not to be blamed in the
world. And if anyone blames that teacher, his blame is improper,
untrue, not in accordance with reality, and faulty.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
78. At this the Brahmin Lohicca said to the Lord: 'Reverend Gotama,
it is as if a man were to seize someone by the hair who had stumbled
and was falling into a pit<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote238anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote238sym"><SUP>238</SUP></A></SUP>
and to set him on firm ground - just so, I, who was falling into the
pit, have been saved by the Reverend Gotama! Excellent, Reverend
Gotama, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been
knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to
bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could
see what was there. Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the
Dhamma in various ways.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'I go for refuge to the Lord Gotama, the Dhamma and the Sangha. May
the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower who has taken refuge
from this day forth for as long as life shall last!'</P>
