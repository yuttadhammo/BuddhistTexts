Sonadanda Sutta: About Sonadanda - The Qualities of a True Brahmin</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[111] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was travelling among the
Angas with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he arrived
at Campa. At Campa he stayed by Gaggara's lotus-pond. At that time
the Brahmin Sonadanda was living at Campa, a populous place, full of
grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King
Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. And the Brahmins and householders of Campa heard say: 'The ascetic
Gotama of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is
travelling among the Angas ... and is staying by Gaggara's
lotus-pool. And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has
been spread about: &quot;This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a
fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a
Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be
tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.&quot; He
proclaims this world with its gods, maras, Brahmas, the world of
ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to
know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in
its beginning, lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending, in the
spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected,
thoroughly purified holy life. And indeed it is good to see such
Arahants.' [112] Thereupon the Brahmins and householders of Campa,
leaving Campa in great crowds, in vast numbers, went to Gaggara's
lotus-pond.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Just then, the Brahmin Sonadanda had gone up to his verandah for
his midday rest. Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for
Gaggara's lotus-pond, he asked his steward the reason.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Sir, it is the ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans ... That is why they
are going to see him.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Well then, steward, go to the Brahmins and householders of Campa and
say to them: &quot;Please wait, gentlemen, the Brahmin Sonadanda will
come to see the ascetic Gotama.&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
And the steward conveyed this message to [113] the Brahmins and
householders of Campa.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. Now at that time some five hundred Brahmins from various provinces
were in Campa on some business, and they heard that Sonadanda
intended to visit the ascetic Gotama. So they called upon him and
asked if this were true. 'So it is, gentlemen, I am going to visit
the ascetic Gotama.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. 'Sir, do not visit the ascetic Gotama, it is not fitting that you
should do so! If the Reverend Sonadanda goes to visit the ascetic
Gotama, his reputation will decrease, and that of the ascetic Gotama
will increase. This being so, it is not right that the Reverend
Sonadanda should visit the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic
Gotama should visit him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'The Reverend Sonadanda is well-born on both the mother's and the
father's side, of pure descent to the seventh generation, unbroken,
of irreproachable birth, and therefore he should not call on the
ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should call on him. The
Reverend Sonadanda is possessed of great wealth and resources...
[114] The Reverend Sonadanda is a scholar, versed in the mantras,
accomplished in the Three Vedas, a skilled expounder of the rules and
rituals, the lore of sounds and meanings and, fifthly, oral tradition
- an expounder, fully versed in natural philosophy and the marks of a
Great Man. The Reverend Sonadanda is handsome, good-looking,
pleasing, of the most beautiful complexion, in form and countenance
like Brahma, of no mean appearance. He is virtuous, of increasing
virtue, endowed with increasing virtue. He is well-spoken, of
pleasing address, polite, of pure and clear enunciation, speaking to
the point. He is the teacher's teacher of many, teaching the mantras
to three hundred youths, and many young men come from different
districts and regions seeking to learn the mantras in his presence,
desirous to learn them from him. He is aged, grown old, venerable,
advanced in years, long past his youth, whereas the ascetic Gotama is
youthful and newly gone forth as a wanderer. The Reverend Sonadanda
is esteemed, made much of, honoured, revered, worshipped by King
Seniya Bimbisara and by the Brahmin Pokkharasati. He lives at Campa,
a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which has
been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal
gift, and with royal powers. This being so, it is not proper that he
should visit the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should
visit him.'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote157anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote157sym"><SUP>157</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. At this Sonadanda replied: [115] 'Now listen, gentlemen, as to why
it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama, and why it is not
fitting for him to visit us. The ascetic Gotama is well-born on both
sides of pure descent to the seventh generation, unbroken, of it
reproachable birth... (as verse 5). Therefore it is fitting for us to
visit him. He went forth, leaving a great body of kinsmen. In fact he
gave up much gold and wealth to go forth, both hidden away and openly
displayed. The ascetic Gotama, while youthful, a black-haired youth,
in the prime of his young days, in the first stage of life went forth
from the household life into homelessness. Leaving his grieving
parents weeping with tear-stained faces, having cut off his hair and
beard and put on yellow robes, he went forth into homelessness. He is
handsome,... virtuous,... wellspoken,... the teacher's teacher of
many. He has abandoned sensuality and dispelled vanity. He teaches
action and the results of action, honouring the blameless Brahmin way
of life. He is a wanderer of high birth, of a leading Khattiya
family. He is a wanderer from a wealthy family, of great wealth and
possessions. [116] People come to consult him from foreign kingdoms
and foreign lands. Many thousands of devas have taken refuge with
him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'This good report has been spread about him: &quot;This Blessed Lord
is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and
conduct...&quot; (as verse 2). He bears the thirtytwo marks of a
Great Man. He is welcoming, kindly of speech, courteous, genial,
clear and ready of speech. He is attended by four assemblies,
revered, honoured, esteemed and worshipped by them. Many devas and
humans are devoted to him. Whenever he stays in any town or village,
that place is not troubled by non-human beings. He has a crowd, a
multitude of followers, is a teacher of many, he is consulted by the
chief of the various leaders of sects. It is not the way with the
ascetic Gotama's reputation, as it is with that of some ascetics and
Brahmins, about whom this or that is reported - the ascetic Gotama's
fame is based on his achievement of unsurpassed wisdom and conduct.
Indeed King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha has gone for refuge to him
together with his son, his wife, his followers and his ministers. So
have King Pasenadi of Kosala and the Brahmin Pokkharasati. He is
revered, honoured, esteemed and worshipped by them. [117]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Campa and is staying by Gaggaraâ€™s
lotus-pond. And whatever ascetics and Brahmins come to our territory
are our guests. And we should revere, honour, esteem and worship
guests. Having come to Gaggara's lotus-pond, the ascetic Gotama is
such a guest, and should be treated as such. Therefore it is not
proper that he should come to us, but rather we should go to him.
However much I might praise the ascetic Gotama, that praise is
insufficient, he is beyond all praise.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. On hearing this, the Brahmins said to Sonadanda: 'Sir, since you
praise the ascetic Gotama so much, then even if he were to live a
hundred yojanas from here, it would be fitting for a believing
clansman to go with a shoulder-bag to visit him. And so, sir, we
shall all go to visit the ascetic Gotama.' And so Sonadanda went with
a large company of Brahmins to Gaggara's lotus-pond.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. But when Sonadanda had traversed the jungle-thickets, he thought:
'If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question, he might say to me: &quot;That,
Brahmin, is not a fitting question, it is not at all a fitting
question&quot;, and then the company might despise me, saying:
&quot;Sonadanda is a fool, he has no sense, [118] he can't put a
proper question to the ascetic Gotama.&quot; And if anyone were
despised by this company, his reputation would suffer, and then his
income would suffer, for our income depends on the gaining of a
reputation. Or if the ascetic Gotama were to ask me a question, my
answer might not satisfy him, and he might say: &quot;That is not the
right way to answer this question.&quot; And then the company might
despise me ... And if, having come into the presence of the ascetic
Gotama, I were to turn away without showing myself, this company
might despise me...'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9. Then Sonadanda approached the Lord, exchanged courtesies with him,
and sat down to one side. Some of the Brahmins and householders made
obeisance to the Lord, some exchanged courtesies with him, some
saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan,
and some sat down to one side in silence. [119]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
10. So Sonadanda took his seat with many thoughts going through his
mind: 'If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question, he might say to me:
&quot;That, Brahmin, is not a fitting question...&quot; If only the
ascetic Gotama would ask me a question from my own field of the Three
Vedas! Then I could give him an answer that would satisfy him!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
11. And the Lord, reading his mind, thought: 'This Sonadanda is
worried. Suppose I were to ask him a question from his own field as a
teacher of the Three Vedas!' So he said to Sonadanda: 'By how many
qualities do Brahmins recognise a Brahmin? How would one declare
truthfully and without falling into falsehood: &quot;I am a
Brahmin&quot;?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
12. Then Sonadanda thought: [120] 'Now what I wanted, hoped for,
desired and longed for has happened ... Now I can give him an answer
that will satisfy him.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
13. Straightening up, and looking round the assembly, he said:
'Reverend Gotama, there are five such qualities ... What are they? A
Brahmin is well-born on both the mother's and the father's side, of
pure descent to the seventh generation,... he is a scholar versed in
the mantras,... he is handsome, pleasing,... he is virtuous,... he is
learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial
ladle. These are the five qualities of a true Brahmin.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
14. 'But if one of these five qualities were omitted, could not one
be recognised as a true Brahmin, being possessed of four of these
qualities?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'It is possible, Gotama. We could leave out appearance, for what does
that matter? If a Brahmin had the other four qualities [121] he could
be recognised as a true Brahmin.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
15. 'But could not one of these four qualities be omitted, leaving
three whereby one could be recognised as a true Brahmin?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'It is possible, Gotama. We could leave out the mantras, for what do
they matter? If he had the other three qualities he could be
recognised as a true Brahmin.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
16. 'But could not one of these three qualities be omitted?â€™</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'It is possible, Gotama. We could leave out birth, for what does that
matter? If a Brahmin is virtuous, of increasing virtue,... and if he
is learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the
sacrificial ladle - then he can be recognised as a true Brahmin and
truthfully claim to be so.' [122]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
17. At this the Brahmins said to Sonadanda: 'Don't say that,
Sonadanda don't say it! The Reverend Sonadanda is decrying
appearance, the mantras and birth, he is actually adopting the
ascetic Gotama's own words!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
18. Then the Lord said to the Brahmins: 'If you think the Brahmin
Sonadanda is not concentrating on his task, is using wrong words, is
lacking in wisdom, and is not fit to converse with the ascetic
Gotama, then let him cease, and you talk to me. But if you think he
is learned, speaks properly, is wise and fit to converse with the
ascetic Gotama, then you cease and let him speak.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
19. Then Sonadanda said to the Lord: 'Let that be, Reverend Gotama,
and be silent. I will answer in this matter.' To the Brahmins he
said: 'Do not say the Reverend Sonadanda is decrying appearance ...
and adopting the ascetic Gotama's own words! [123] I do not decry
appearance, mantras, or birth.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
20. Now at that time Sonadanda's nephew, a young man called Angaka,
was sitting in the assembly, and Sonadanda said: 'Gentlemen, do you
see my nephew Angaka?' 'Yes, sir.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Angaka is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of supremely fair
complexion, in form and countenance like Brahma, of no mean
appearance, and there is none in this assembly his equal except the
ascetic Gotama. He is a scholar ...I was his mantra-teacher. He is
well-born on both sides ...I know his parents. But if Angaka were to
take life, take what is not given, commit adultery, tell lies and
drink strong drink - what would good looks, or mantras, or birth
profit him? But it is because a Brahmin is virtuous,... because he is
wise... on account of these two points that he can truthfully
declare:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;I am a Brahmin.&quot;'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
21. 'But, Brahmin, if one were to omit one of these two points, could
one truthfully declare: &quot;I am a Brahmin&quot;?' [124]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'No, Gotama. For wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is
purified by wisdom: where one is, the other is, the moral man has
wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality
and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world. Just as one hand
washes the other, or one foot the other, so wisdom is purified by
morality and this combination is called the highest thing in the
world.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
22. 'So it is, Brahmin. Wisdom is purified by morality, and morality
is purified by wisdom: where one is, the other is, the moral man has
wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality
and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world. But, Brahmin,
what is this morality and what is this wisdom?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'We only know this much, Gotama. It would be well if the Reverend
Gotama were to explain the meaning of this.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
23. 'Then listen, Brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will tell
you.' 'Yes, sir', said Sonadanda in reply, and the Lord said:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Brahmin, a Tathagata arises in this world, an Arahant,
fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct,
Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be
tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He,
having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world
with its devas, maras and Brahmns, its princes and people. He
preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
displays the fullyperfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes
forth and practises the moralities (Sutta 2, verses 41-63); he guards
the sensedoors, etc. (Sutta 2, verses 64-74). That, Brahmin, is
morality.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote158anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote158sym"><SUP>158</SUP></A></SUP>
He attains the four jhanas (Sutta 2, verses 75-82); he attains
various insights (Sutta 2, verses 83-95), and the cessation of the
corruptions (Sutta 2, verse 97). Thus he develops wisdom. That,
Brahmin, is wisdom.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
24. At these words Sonadanda said: 'Excellent, Lord, excellent! It is
as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point
out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a
dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so
the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. And I go
for refuge to the Blessed Lord Gotama, to the Dhamma and to the
Sangha. May the Reverend Gotama accept me from this day forth as a
lay-follower as long as life shall last! And may the Reverend Gotama
and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrow!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
The Lord assented by silence. Then Sonadanda, seeing his assent,
rose, saluted the Lord, passed by to his right and departed. As day
was breaking, he caused hard and soft food to be prepared in his own
home, and when it was ready he announced: 'Reverend Gotama, it is
time; the meal is ready.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
25. And the Lord, having risen early, went with robe and bowl and
attended by his monks to Sonadanda's residence and sat down on the
prepared seat. And Sonadanda served the Buddha and his monks with the
finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfied. And when
the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl, Sonadanda
took a low stool and sat down to one side. Then he said to the Lord:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
26. 'Reverend Gotama, if when I have gone into the assembly I were to
rise and salute the Lord, the company would despise me. In that case
my reputation would suffer, and if a man's reputation suffers, his
income suffers ... So if, on entering the assembly, I should join my
palms in greeting, may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had risen
from my seat. And if [126] on entering the assembly I should take off
my turban, may you take it as if I had bowed at your feet. Or if,
when riding in my carriage, I were to alight to salute the Lord, the
company would despise me ...So if, when I am riding in my carriage, I
raise my goad, may you take it as if I had alighted from my carriage,
and if I lower my hand, may you take it as if I had bowed my head at
your feet.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote159anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote159sym"><SUP>159</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
27. Then the Lord, having instructed Sonadanda with a talk on Dhamma,
inspired him, fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him, rose from
his seat and departed.</P>
