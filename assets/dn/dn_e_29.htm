Pasadika Sutta: The Delightful Discourse</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[117] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying among the
Sakyans, at the [School] building<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote888anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote888sym"><SUP>888</SUP></A></SUP>
in the mangogrove belonging to the Vedhanna family.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote889anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote889sym"><SUP>889</SUP></A></SUP>
At that time the Nigantha Nataputta had just died at Pava.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote890anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote890sym"><SUP>890</SUP></A></SUP>
And at his death the Niganthas were split into two parties,
quarrelling and disputing, fighting and attacking each other with
wordy warfare: 'You don't understand this doctrine and discipline - I
do!' 'How could you understand this doctrine and discipline?&quot;Your
way is all wrong - mine is right!' 'I am consistent - you areri t!'
'You said last what you should have said first, and you said first
what you should have said last!' 'What you took so long to think up
has been refuted!' 'Your argument has been overthrown, you're
defeated!' 'Go on, save your doctrine - get out of that if you can!'
You would have thought the Niganthas, Nataputta's disciples, were
bent on killing each other. Even the white-robed lay [118] followers
were disgusted, displeased and repelled when they saw that their
doctrine and discipline was so ill-proclaimed, so unedifyingly
displayed, and so ineffectual in calming the passions, having been
proclaimed by one not fully enlightened, and now with its support
gone, without an arbiter.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote891anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote891sym"><SUP>891</SUP></A></SUP></P>

2. Now the novice Cunda, who had spent the Rains at Pava, came to
Samagama to see the Venerable Ananda. Saluting him, he sat down to
one side and said: 'Sir, the Nigantha Nataputta has just died at
Pava.' And he related what had happened. The Venerable Ananda said:
'Cunda, that is something that ought to be reported to the Blessed
Lord. Let us go and tell him.' 'Very good, sir', said Cunda.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. So they went to the Lord and told him. He said: 'Cunda, here is a
doctrine and discipline that is ill-proclaimed, [119] unedifyingly
displayed and ineffectual in calming the passions because its
proclaimer was not fully enlightened.</P>

4. 'Such being the case, Cunda, a disciple cannot live according to
that doctrine and maintain proper conduct, nor live by it, but
deviates from it. To him one might say: &quot;Friend, this is what

Your teacher is not fully enlightened ... You cannot live according
to that doctrine..., but deviate from it.&quot; In this case, Cunda,
the teacher is to blame, the doctrine is to blame, but the pupil is
praiseworthy. And if anyone were to say to that pupil: &quot;Come
now, reverend sir, and practise according to the doctrine proclaimed
and given out by your teacher&quot; - then the one who urged this,
the thing urged and the one who so practised would all gain much
demerit.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote894anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote894sym"><SUP>894</SUP></A></SUP>

5. 'But here, Cunda, is a teacher who is not fully enlightened ...
and a disciple lives according to that doctrine, and conforms to it.

your teacher is not fully [120] enlightened, his teaching is
ill-proclaimed,... but yet you continue to live according to it...
“In this case the teacher, the doctrine and the disciple are all to
blame. And if anyone were to say: &quot;Well, reverend sir, by
following that system you will be successful&quot;, the one who so
recommended it, that which was recommended, and the one who, on
hearing such recommendation, should make still greater efforts, would
all gain much demerit. Why? Because the doctrine is ill-proclaimed...</P>

6. 'But here now is a teacher who is fully enlightened: his doctrine
is well-proclaimed, edifyingly displayed, effectual in calming the
passions because of that enlightened teacher, but the disciple does
not live up to the doctrine..., but deviates from it. In that case
one might say to him: &quot;Friend, you have failed, you have missed
your opportunity;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote897anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote897sym"><SUP>897</SUP></A></SUP>
your teacher is fully enlightened, his doctrine is

In this case the teacher and the doctrine are praiseworthy, but the
pupil is to blame. And if anyone were to say: &quot;Well, reverend
sir, you should follow the teaching proclaimed by your teacher&quot;,
then the one who urged this, that which was urged and the one who so
practised would all gain much merit. Why? Because the doctrine is
well-proclaimed... [121]</P>

7. 'But now, Cunda, here is a teacher who is fully enlightened, his
doctrine is well-proclaimed,... and the disciple, having taken it up,
follows it, practising it properly and keeping to it. Someone might
say to him: &quot;Friend, what you have received is good, here is
your opportunity,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote898anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote898sym"><SUP>898</SUP></A></SUP>...
and you are following the doctrine of your teacher.&quot; In this
case the teacher and the doctrine are praiseworthy, and the pupil is
also praiseworthy. And if anyone were to say to such a disciple:
&quot;Well reverend sir, by following that system you will be
successful&quot;, then the one who thus commended it, and that which
was commended, and the one who, on hearing such commendation,
shouldmake still greater efforts, would all gain much merit. Why?
Because that is so when the doctrine and discipline are
wellproclaimed, edifyingly displayed and effectual in calming the
passions because of the fully-enlightened Teacher and supreme Buddha.</P>

8. 'But now, Cunda, suppose a Teacher has arisen in the world, an
Arahant, filly-enlightened Buddha, and his doctrine is
well-proclaimed,... effectual in calming the passions because of that
Teacher. But his disciples have not fully mastered that true Dhamma,

was well-proclaimed,... but we did not fully master the true Dhamma

any holy way of life as being fully successful and perfect, with
nothing lacking and nothing superfluous, well-proclaimed in the
perfection of its purity, it is this holy life they would be

who used to say: &quot;He sees, but does not see.&quot; What is it
that, seeing, one does not see? You can see the blade of a
well-sharpened razor, but not its edge. That is what he meant by
saying: &quot;He sees, but does not see.&quot; He spoke in reference
to a low, vulgar, worldly ignoble thing of no spiritual
significance,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote907anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote907sym"><SUP>907</SUP></A></SUP>

'But if one were to use that expression properly: [127] &quot;He
sees, but does not see&quot;, it would be like this. What he sees is
a holy way of life which is fully successful and perfect, with
nothing lacking and nothing superfluous, well-proclaimed in the
perfection of its purity. If he were to deduct anything from it,
thinking: &quot;In this way it will be purer&quot;, he does not see
it. And if he were to add anything to it, thinking: &quot;In this way
it will be more complete&quot;, then he does not see it.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote908anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote908sym"><SUP>908</SUP></A></SUP>

detachment, filled with delight and happiness. And with the subsiding
of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness
of mind, he enters and remains in the second jhana, which is without
thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight
and happiness. Again, with the fading of delight, remaining
imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experiences in himself

when a monk by the destruction of three fetters has become a
Stream-Winner, no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds, firmly
established, destined for full enlightenment; the second is when a
monk by the complete destruction of three fetters and the reduction
of greed, hatred and delusion, has become a Once-Returner, and having
returned once more to this world, will put an end to suffering; the
third is when a monk, by the complete destruction of the five lower
fetters, has been spontaneously reborn, and there will reach Nibbana
without returning from that world. The fourth is when a monk, by the
destruction of the corruptions in this very life has, by his own
knowledge and realisation, attained to Arahantship, to the
deliverance of heart and through wisdom. Such are the four fruits and

Arahant, whose corruptions are destroyed, who has lived the life,

That would be to suppose that knowledge and insight about one thing
are to be produced by knowledge and insight about something else, as
fools imagine. As regards the past, the Tathagata has knowledge of
past lives. He can remember as far back as he wishes. As for the
future, this knowledge, born of enlightenment, arises in him: &quot;This
is the last birth, there will be no more becoming.&quot;</P>

refers to what is factual, not fabulous, but which is not of
