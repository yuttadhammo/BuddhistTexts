Kevaddha Sutta: About Kevaddha - What Brahma Didn't Know</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[211] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Nalanda, in
Pavarika's mango grove. And the householder Kevaddha<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote220anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote220sym"><SUP>220</SUP></A></SUP>
came to the Lord, prostrated himself before him, and sat down to one
side. He then said: 'Lord, this Nalanda is rich, prosperous,
populous, and full of people who have faith in the Lord. It would be
well if the Lord were to cause some monk to perform superhuman feats
and miracles. In this way Nalanda would come to have even more faith
in the Lord.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
The Lord replied: 'Kevaddha, this is not the way I teach Dhamma to
the monks, by saying: &quot;Go, monks, and perform superhuman feats
and miracles for the white-clothed laypeople!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. For a second time Kevaddha said: 'Lord, I would not be
importunate, but I still say: &quot;This Nalanda is rich, prosperous
... [212] and would come to have even more faith in the Lord.&quot;'
And the Lord replied as before.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. When Kevaddha repeated his request for a third time, the Lord
said: 'Kevaddha, there are three kinds of miracle that I have
declared, having realised them by my own insight. Which three? The
miracle of psychic power,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote221anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote221sym"><SUP>221</SUP></A></SUP>
the miracle of telepathy,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote222anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote222sym"><SUP>222</SUP></A></SUP>
the miracle of instruction.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote223anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote223sym"><SUP>223</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. 'What is the miracle of psychic power? Here, Kevaddha, a monk
displays various psychic powers in different ways. Being one he
becomes many, being many he becomes one... (as Sutta 2, verse 87)
[213] and he travels in the body as far as the Brahma world. Then
someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. 'He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and unbelieving,
saying: &quot;It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power
and skill of that ascetic...&quot; And that man might say: &quot;Sir,
there is something called the Gandhara charm.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote224anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote224sym"><SUP>224</SUP></A></SUP>
It is by means of this that that monk becomes many...&quot; What do
you think, Kevaddha, would not a sceptic say that to a believer?' 'He
would, Lord.' 'And that is why, Kevaddha, seeing the danger of such
miracles, I dislike, reject and despise them.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. 'And what is the miracle of telepathy? Here, a monk reads the
minds of other beings, of other people, reads their mental states,
their thoughts and ponderings, and says: &quot;That is how your mind
is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart.&quot; Then
someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. 'He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and unbelieving,
saying: &quot;It is [214] wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great
power and skill of that ascetic...&quot; And that man might say:
&quot;Sir, there is something called the Manika charm.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote225anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote225sym"><SUP>225</SUP></A></SUP>
It is by means of this that that monk can read the minds of others
... &quot; And that is why, seeing the danger of such miracles, I ...
despise them.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. 'And what is the miracle of instruction? Here, Kevaddha, a monk
gives instruction as follows: &quot;Consider in this way, don't
consider in that, direct your mind this way, not that way, give up
that, gain this and persevere in it.&quot; That, Kevaddha, is called
the miracle of instruction.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9-66. 'Again, Kevaddha, a Tathagata arises in the world, an Arahant,
fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct,
Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be
tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He,
having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world
with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He
preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its
middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and
displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. A disciple goes
forth and practises the moralities (Sutta 2, verses 41-63). He guards
the sense-doors and attains the four jhanas (Sutta 2, verses 64-82);
he attains various insights (Sutta 2, verses 83-84); he realises the
Four Noble Truths, the path and the cessation of the corruptions
(Sutta 2, verses 85-97),<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote226anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote226sym"><SUP>226</SUP></A></SUP>
and he knows: &quot;...There is nothing further here.&quot; That,
Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
67. 'And I, Kevaddha, have experienced these three miracles by my own
super-knowledge. Once, Kevaddha, in this order of monks the thought
occurred to a certain monk: &quot;I wonder where the four great
elements - the earth element, the water element, the fire element,
the air element - cease without remainder.&quot; And that monk
attained to such a state of mental concentration that the way to the
deva-realms appeared before him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
68. 'Then, coming to the Realm of the devas of the Four Great Kings,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote227anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote227sym"><SUP>227</SUP></A></SUP>
he asked those devas: &quot;Friends, where do the four great elements
- earth, water, fire and air - cease without remainder?&quot; At this
question the devas of the Four Great Kings [216] said to him: &quot;Monk,
we don't know where the four great elements cease without remainder.
But the Four Great Kings are loftier and wiser than we are. They may
know where the four great elements cease...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
69. 'So that monk went to the Four Great Kings and asked the same
question, but they replied: &quot;We don't know, but the Thirty-Three
Gods may know...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
70. 'So that monk went to the Thirty-Three Gods, who said: &quot;We
don't know, but Sakka, lord of the gods, may know...&quot; [217]</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
71. 'Sakka, lord of the gods, said: &quot;The Yama devas may know...

72. 'The Yama devas said: &quot;Suyama, son of the devas,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote228anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote228sym"><SUP>228</SUP></A></SUP>

75. 'Santusita said: &quot;The Nimmanarati devas may know...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
76. [2191 'The Nimmanarati devas said: &quot;Sunimmita, son of the
devas, may know...&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
77. 'Sunimitta said: &quot;The Paranimmita-Vasavatti devas may
know...&quot;</P>

78. 'The Paranimmita-Vasavatti devas said: &quot;Vasavatti, son of

79. [220] 'Vasavatti said: &quot;The devas of Brahma s retinue may
know... &quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8o. 'Then that monk, by the appropriate concentration, made the way
to the Brahma world appear before him. He went to the devas of
Brahma's retinue and asked them. They said: &quot;We don't know. But
there is Brahma, Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the
All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Ruler,
Appointer and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. He
is loftier and wiser than we are. He would know where the four great
elements cease without remainder.&quot; &quot;And where, friends, is
this Great Brahma now?&quot; &quot;Monk, we do not know when, how and
where Brahma will appear. But when the signs are seen - when a light
appears and a radiance shines forth - then Brahma will appear. Such
signs are an indication that he will appear.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
81. 'Then it was not long before the Great Brahma [221] appeared. And
that monk went up to him and said: &quot;Friend, where do the four
great elements - earth, water, fire, air - cease without remainder?&quot;
to which the Great Brahma replied: &quot;Monk, I am Brahma, Great
Brahma, the Conqueror, the tinconquered, the All-Seeing,
All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Ruler, Appointer
and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
82. 'A second time the monk said: &quot;Friend, I did not ask if you
are Brahma, Great Brahma ...I asked you where the four great elements
cease without remainder.&quot; And a second time the Great Brahma
replied as before.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
83. 'And a third time the monk said: &quot;Friend, I did not ask you
that, I asked where the four great elements - earth, water, fire, air
- cease without remainder.&quot; Then, Kevaddha, the Great Brahma
took that monk by the arm, led him aside and [222] said: &quot;Monk,
these devas believe there is nothing Brahma does not see, there is
nothing he does not know, there is nothing he is unaware of. That is
why I did not speak in front of them. But, monk, I don't know where
the four great elements cease without remainder. And therefore, monk,
you have acted wrongly, you have acted incorrectly by going beyond
the Blessed Lord and going in search of an answer to this question
elsewhere. Now, monk, you just go to the Blessed Lord and put this
question to him, and whatever answer he gives, accept it.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
84. 'So that monk, as swiftly as a strong man might flex or unflex
his arm, vanished from the Brahma world and appeared in my presence.
He prostrated himself before me, then sat down to one side and said:
&quot;Lord, where do the four great elements - the earth element, the
water element, the fire element and the air element - cease without
remainder?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
85. 'I replied: &quot;Monk, once upon a time seafaring merchants,
when they set sail on the ocean, took in their ship a landsighting
bird. When they could not see the land themselves, they released this
bird. The bird flew to the east, to the south, to the west, to the
north, it flew to the zenith and to the intermediate points of the
compass. If it saw land anywhere, it flew there. But if it saw no
land, it returned to the ship. In the same way, monk, you have been
[223] as far as the Brahma world searching for an answer to your
question and not finding it, and now you come back to me. But, monk,
you should not ask your question in this way: 'Where do the four
great elements - the earth element, the water element, the fire
element, the air element - cease without remainder?' Instead, this is
how the question should have been put:</P>
