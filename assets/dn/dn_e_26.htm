[59] 2. 'Once, monks, there was a wheel-turning monarch named
Dalhanemi, a righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four
quarters, who had established the security of his realm and was
possessed of the seven treasures. These are: the Wheel Treasure, the
Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman
Treasure, the Householder Treasurer, and, as seventh, the Counsellor
Treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic
stature, conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered
this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law (as Sutta 3,
verse 1.5).</P>

3. 'And, after many hundreds and thousands of years, King Dalhanemi
said to a certain man: &quot;My good man, whenever you see that the
sacred Wheel-Treasure has slipped from its position, report it to
me.&quot; &quot;Yes, sire&quot;, the man replied. And after many
hundreds and thousands of years the man saw that the sacred
Wheel-Treasure had slipped from its position. Seeing this, he
reported the fact to the King. Then King Dalhanemi sent for his
eldest son, the crown prince, and said: &quot;My son, the sacred
Wheel-Treasure has slipped from its position. And I have heard say
that when this happens to a wheelturning monarch, he has not much
longer to live. I have had my fill [60] of human pleasures, now is
the time to seek heavenly pleasures. You, my son, take over control
of this ocean-bounded land. I will shave off my hair and beard, don
yellow robes, and go forth from the household life into
homelessness.&quot; And, having installed his eldest son in due form
as king, King Dalhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, donned yellow
robes, and went forth from the household life into homelessness. And,
seven days after the royal sage had gone forth, the sacred
Wheel-Treasure vanished.</P>

4. 'Then a certain man came to the anointed Khattiya King and said:
&quot;Sire, you should know that the sacred Wheel-Treasure has
disappeared.&quot; At this the King was grieved and felt sad. He went
to the royal sage and told him the news. And the royal sage said to
him: &quot;My son, you should not grieve or feel sad at the
disappearance of the Wheel-Treasure. The Wheel-Treasure is not an

life of sensual infatuation and are devoted to forbearance and
gentleness, each one taming himself, each one calming himself and
each one striving for the end of craving, if from time to time they
should come to you and consult you as to what is wholesome and what
is unwholesome, what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what is to
be followed and what is not to be followed, and what action will in
the long run lead to harm and sorrow, and what to welfare and
happiness, you should listen, and tell them to avoid evil and do what
is good .<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote780anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote780sym"><SUP>780</SUP></A></SUP>

the fifteenth, when he had washed his head and gone up to the

Wheel-Treasure appeared to him, thousand-spoked, complete with
felloe, hub and all appurtenances. Then the King thought: &quot;I

with his right hand, and said: &quot;May the noble Wheel-Treasure
turn, may the noble Wheel-Treasure conquer!&quot; The Wheel turned to
the east, and the King followed it with his fourfold army. And in
whatever country the Wheel stopped, the King took up residence with
his fourfold army. And those who opposed him in the eastern region

seven days after the royal sage had gone forth the Wheel disappeared.</P>

9. 'Then a man came to the King and said: &quot;Sire, you should know

King was grieved and felt sad. But he did not go to the royal sage
and ask him about the duties of a wheelturning monarch. Instead, he
ruled the people according to his own ideas, and, being so ruled, the
people did not prosper so well as they had done under the previous
kings who had performed the duties of a wheel-turning monarch. Then
the ministers, counsellors, treasury officials, guards and
doorkeepers, and the chanters of mantras came to the King and said:
[65] &quot;Sire, as long as you rule the people according to your own
ideas, and differently from the way they were ruled before under
previous wheel-turning monarchs, the people do not prosper so well.
Sire, there are ministers ... in your realm, including ourselves, who
have preserved the knowledge of how a wheel-turning monarch should
rule. Ask us, Your Majesty, and we will tell you!&quot;</P>

lo. 'Then the King ordered all the ministers and others to come
together, and he consulted them. And they explained to him the duties
of a wheel-turning monarch. And, having listened to them, the King
established guard and protection, but he did not give property to the
needy, and as a result poverty became rife. With the spread of
poverty, a man took what was not given, thus committing what was
called theft. They arrested him, and brought him before the King,
saying:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
&quot;Your Majesty, this man took what was not given, which we call
theft.&quot; The King said to him: &quot;Is it true that you took

live on.&quot; [66] Then the King gave the man some property, saying:
&quot;With this, my good man, you can keep yourself, support your
mother and father, keep a wife and children, carry on a business and
make gifts to ascetics and Brahmins, which will promote your
spiritual welfare and lead to a happy rebirth with pleasant result in

those who took what was not given, and they thought: &quot;Suppose we

given, and they brought him before the King. [67] The King asked him
why he had done this, and he replied: &quot;Your Majesty, I have
nothing to live on.&quot; Then the King thought: &quot;If I give
property to everybody who takes what is not given, this theft will
increase more and more. I had better make an end of him, finish him
off once for all, and cut his head off.&quot; So he commanded his
men: &quot;Bind this man's arms tightly behind him with a strong
rope, shave his head closely, and lead him to the rough sound of a
drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern
gate, and there finish by inflicting the capital penalty and cutting
off his head!&quot; And they did so.</P>

swords made for us, and then we can take from anybody what is not
given [which is called theft], [68] we will make an end of them,

having procured some sharp swords, they launched murderous assaults

endowed with wisdom and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds,
incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans,
enlightened and blessed, just as I am now. He will thoroughly know by
his own super-knowledge, and proclaim, this universe with its devas
and maras and Brahmas, its ascetics and Brahmins, and this generation
with its princes and people, just as I do now. He will teach the
Dhamma, lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its
ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and proclaim, just as I do
now, the holy life in its fullness and purity. He will be attended by
a company of thousands of monks, just as I am attended by a company
of hundreds.</P>

seclusion, ardent, eager and resolute, and before long he will have

of which young men of good family go forth from the household life
into homelessness, and will abide therein.</P>
