Mahasamaya Sutta: The Mighty Gathering - Devas Come to See the Buddha</H2>

Once the Lord was staying among the Sakyans in the Great Forest at
Kapilavatthu, with a large company of some five hundred monks, all
Arahants. And devas from ten world-systems<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote555anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote555sym"><SUP>555</SUP></A></SUP>
frequently came there to visit the Lord and his order of monks.</P>

2. And it occurred to four devas of the Pure Abodes:<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote556anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote556sym"><SUP>556</SUP></A></SUP>
'The Blessed Lord is staying at Kapilavatthu, with a large company of
some five hundred monks, all Arahants. What if we were to approach
him, and each recite a verse?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Then those devas, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his
flexed arm, or flex it again, [254] vanished from the Pure Abodes and
appeared before the Lord. Then they saluted him and stood to one
side, and one of them recited this verse:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Great the assembly in the forest here, the devas have met<BR>And we
are here to see the unconquered brotherhood.'</P>

Another said:</P>

'The monks with concentrated minds are straight: <BR>They guard their
senses as the driver does his reins.'</P>

Another said:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Bars and barriers broken, the threshold-stone of lust torn
up,<BR>Unstained the spotless seers go, like well-trained elephants.'
[255]</P>

And another said:</P>

left the body he'll join the deva hosts.'</P>

4. Then the Lord said to his monks: 'Monks, it has often happened
that the devas from ten world-systems have come to see the Tathagata
and his order of monks. So it has been with the supreme Buddhas of
the past, and so it will be with those of the future, as it is with
me now. I will detail for you the names of the groups of devas,
announce them and teach them to you. Pay close attention, and I will
speak.'</P>
