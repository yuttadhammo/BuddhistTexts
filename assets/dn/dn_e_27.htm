[80] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote800anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote800sym"><SUP>800</SUP></A></SUP>
Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, at the mansion of Migara's
mother<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote801anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote801sym"><SUP>801</SUP></A></SUP>
in the East Park. And at that time Vasettha and Bharadvaja<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote802anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote802sym"><SUP>802</SUP></A></SUP>
were living among the monks, hoping to become monks themselves. And
in the evening, the Lord rose from his secluded meditation and came
out of the mansion, and started walking up and down in its shade.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. Vasettha noticed this, and he said to Bharadvaja: 'Friend
Bharadvaja, the Lord has come out and is walking up and down. Let us
approach him. We might be fortunate enough to hear a talk on Dhamma
from the Lord himself.' 'Yes, indeed', said Bharadvaja, so they went
up to the Lord, saluted him, and fell into step with him.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Then the Lord said to Vasettha: [81] 'Vasettha,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote803anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote803sym"><SUP>803</SUP></A></SUP>
you two are Brahmins born and bred, and you have gone forth from the
household life into homelessness from Brahmin families. Do not the
Brahmins revile and abuse you?' 'Indeed, Lord, the Brahmins do revile
and abuse us. They don't hold back with their usual flood of
reproaches.' 'Well, Vasettha, what kind of reproaches do they fling
at you?' 'Lord, what the Brahmins say is this: &quot;The Brahmin
caste<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote804anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote804sym"><SUP>804</SUP></A></SUP>
is the highest caste, other castes are base; the Brahmin caste is
fair, other castes are dark; Brahmins are purified, non-Brahmins are
not, the Brahmins are the true children of Brahma,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote805anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote805sym"><SUP>805</SUP></A></SUP>
born from his mouth, born of Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of
Brahma. And you, you have deserted the highest class and gone over to
the base class of shaveling petty ascetics, servants, dark fellows
born of Brahma's foot!<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote806anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote806sym"><SUP>806</SUP></A></SUP>
It's not right, it's not proper for you to mix with such people!&quot;
That is the way the Brahmins abuse us, Lord.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. 'Then, Vasettha, the Brahmins have forgotten their ancient
tradition when they say that. Because we can see Brahmin women, the
wives of Brahmins, who menstruate and become pregnant, [82] have
babies and give suck. And yet these womb-born Brahmins talk about
being born from Brahma's mouth ... These Brahmins misrepresent
Brahma, tell lies and earn much demerit.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
5. 'There are, Vasettha, these four castes: the Khattiyas, the
Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote807anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote807sym"><SUP>807</SUP></A></SUP>
And sometimes a Khattiya takes life, takes what is not given, commits
sexual misconduct, tells lies, indulges in slander, harsh speech or
idle chatter, is grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. Thus such
things as are immoral and considered so, blameworthy and considered
so, to be avoided and considered so, ways unbefitting an Ariyan and
considered so, black with black result<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote808anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote808sym"><SUP>808</SUP></A></SUP>
and blamed by the wise, are sometimes to be found among the
Khattiyas, and the same applies to Brahmins, merchants and artisans.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
6. 'Sometimes, too, a Khattiya refrains from taking life,... is not
grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. Thus such things as are moral
and considered so, blameless and considered so, to be followed and
considered so, ways befitting an Ariyan and considered so, bright
with bright results and praised by the wise, are sometimes to be
found among the Khattiyas, and [83] likewise among Brahmins,
merchants and artisans.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. 'Now since both dark and bright qualities, which are blamed and
praised by the wise, are scattered indiscriminately among the four
castes, the wise do not recognise the claim about the Brahmin caste
being the highest. Why is that? Because, Vasettha, anyone from the
four castes who becomes a monk, an Arahant who has destroyed the
corruptions, who has lived the life, done what had to be done, laid
down the burden,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote809anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote809sym"><SUP>809</SUP></A></SUP>
reached the highest goal, destroyed the fetter of becoming, and
become emancipated through super-knowledge - he is proclaimed supreme
by virtue of Dhamma and not of non-Dhamma.</P>

8. 'This illustration will make clear to you how Dhamma is best in
this world and in the next. King Pasenadi of Kosala knows: &quot;The
ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighbouring clan' of the
Sakyans.&quot; Now the Sakyans are vassals of the King of Kosala.
They offer him humble service and salute him, rise and do him homage
and pay him fitting service. And, just as the Sakyans offer the King
humble service..., [84] so likewise does the King offer humble
service to the Tathagata,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote810anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote810sym"><SUP>810</SUP></A></SUP>
thinking: &quot;If the ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am illborn; if
the ascetic Gotama is strong, I am weak; if the ascetic Gotama is
pleasant to look at, I am ill-favoured; if the ascetic Gotama is
influential, I am of little influence.&quot; Now it is because of
honouring the Dhamma, making much of the Dhamma, esteeming the
Dhamma, doing reverent homage to the Dhamma that King Pasenadi does
humble service to the Tathagata and pays him fitting service:</P>

9. 'Vasettha, all of you, though of different birth, name, clan and

homelessness, if you are asked who you are, should reply: &quot;We
are ascetics, followers of the Sakyan.&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote811anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote811sym"><SUP>811</SUP></A></SUP>
He whose faith in the Tathagata is settled, rooted, established,
solid, unshakeable by any ascetic or Brahmin, any deva or mara or
Brahma or anyone in the world, can truly say: &quot;I am a true son
of Blessed Lord, born of his mouth, born of Dhamma, created by
Dhamma, an heir of Dhamma.&quot; Why is that? Because, Vasettha, this
designates the Tathagata: &quot;The Body of Dhamma&quot;,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote812anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote812sym"><SUP>812</SUP></A></SUP>

10. 'There comes a time, Vasettha, when, sooner or later after a long
period, this world contracts.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote815anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote815sym"><SUP>815</SUP></A></SUP>
At a time of contraction, beings are mostly born in the Abhassara
Brahma world. And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight,
self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious - and they stay like
that for a very long time. But sooner or later, after a very long
period, this world begins to expand again. At a time of expansion,
the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world, [85] having passed away
from there, are mostly reborn in this world. Here they dwell,
mind-made, feeding on delight, selfluminous, moving through the air,
glorious<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote816anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote816sym"><SUP>816</SUP></A></SUP>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
11. 'At that period, Vasettha, there was just one mass of water, and
all was darkness, blinding darkness. Neither moon nor sun appeared,
no constellations or stars appeared, night and day were not
distinguished, nor months and fortnights, no years or seasons, and no
male and female, beings being reckoned just as beings.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote817anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote817sym"><SUP>817</SUP></A></SUP>
And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savoury earth<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote818anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote818sym"><SUP>818</SUP></A></SUP>
spread itself over the waters where those beings were. It looked just
like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools. It was
endowed with colour, smell and taste. It was the colour of fine ghee
or butter, and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
12. 'Then some being of a greedy nature said: &quot;I say, what can
this be?&quot; and tasted the savoury earth on its finger. In so
doing, it became taken with the flavour, and craving arose in it.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote819anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote819sym"><SUP>819</SUP></A></SUP>
Then other beings, taking their cue from that one, also tasted the
stuff with their fingers. They too were taken with the flavour, and
craving arose in them. So they set to with their hands, breaking off
pieces of the stuff in order to eat it. And [86] the result of this
was that their self-luminance disappeared. And as a result of the
disappearance of their selfluminance, the moon and the sun appeared,
night and day were distinguished, months and fortnights appeared, and
the year and its seasons. To that extent the world re-evolved.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
13. 'And those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this
savoury earth, feeding on it and being nourished by it. And as they
did so, their bodies became coarser,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote820anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote820sym"><SUP>820</SUP></A></SUP>
and a difference in looks developed among them. Some beings became
good-looking, others ugly. And the good-looking ones despised the
others, saying: &quot;We are better-looking than they are.&quot; And
because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the
savoury earth disappeared. At this they came together and lamented,
crying: &quot;Oh that flavour! Oh that flavour!&quot; And so nowadays
when people say: &quot;Oh that flavour!&quot; when they get something
nice, they are repeating an ancient saying without realising it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
14. 'And then, when the savoury earth had disappeared, [87] a fungus<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote821anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote821sym"><SUP>821</SUP></A></SUP>
cropped up, in the manner of a mushroom. It was of a good colour,
smell, and taste. It was the colour of fine ghee or butter, and it
was very sweet, like pure wild honey. And those beings set to and ate
the fungus. And this lasted for a very long time. And as they
continued to feed on the fungus, so their bodies became coarser
still, and the difference in their looks increased still more. And
the good-looking ones despised the others ... And because they became
arrogant and conceited about their looks, the sweet fungus
disappeared. Next, creepers appeared, shooting up like bamboo..., and
they too were very sweet, like pure wild honey.</P>

15. 'And those beings set to and fed on those creepers. And as they
did so, their bodies became even coarser, and the difference in their
looks increased still more... [88] And they became still more
arrogant, and so the creepers disappeared too. At this they came
together and lamented; crying: &quot;Alas, our creeper's gone! What
have we lost!&quot; And so now today when people, on being asked why
they are upset, say: &quot;Oh, what have we lost!&quot; they are
repeating an ancient saying without realising it.</P>

16. 'And then, after the creepers had disappeared, rice appeared in
open spaces,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote822anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote822sym"><SUP>822</SUP></A></SUP>
free from powder and from husks, fragrant and clean-grained.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote823anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote823sym"><SUP>823</SUP></A></SUP>
And what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and
was ripe in the morning, and what they had taken in the morning for
breakfast was ripe again by evening, with no sign of reaping. And
these beings set to and fed on this rice, and this lasted for a very
long time. And as they did so, their bodies became coarser still, and
the difference in their looks became even greater. And the females
developed female sex-organs,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote824anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote824sym"><SUP>824</SUP></A></SUP>
and the males developed male organs. And the women became excessively
preoccupied with men, and the men with women. Owing to this excessive
preoccupation with each other, passion was aroused, and their bodies
burnt with lust. And later, because of this burning, they indulged in
sexual activity.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote825anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote825sym"><SUP>825</SUP></A></SUP>
But those who saw them indulging threw dust, ashes or [89] cow-dung
at them, crying: &quot;Die, you filthy beast! How can one being do
such things to another!&quot; Just as today, in some districts, when
a daughter-in-law is led out, some people throw dirt at her, some
ashes, and some cow-dung, without realising that they are repeating
an ancient observance. What was considered bad form in those days is
now considered good form.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote826anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote826sym"><SUP>826</SUP></A></SUP></P>

allowed into a village or town for one or two months. Accordingly
those who indulged for an excessively long period in such immoral

'Now it occurred to one of those beings who was inclined to laziness:
&quot;Well now, why should I be bothered to gather rice in the
evening for supper and in the morning for breakfast? Why shouldn't I
gather it all at once for both meals?&quot; And he did so. Then
another one came to him and said: &quot;Come on, let's go
rice-gathering.&quot; &quot;No need, my friend, I've gathered enough
for both meals.&quot; Then the other, following his example, gathered
enough rice for two days at a time, saying: &quot;That should be
about enough.&quot; Then another being came and said [90] to that
second one: &quot;Come on, let's go rice-gathering.&quot; &quot;No
need, my friend, I've gathered enough for two days.&quot; (The same
for 4, then 8, days). However, when those beings made a store of rice
and lived on that, husk-powder and husk began to envelop the grain,
and where it was reaped it did not grow again, and the cut place
showed, and the rice grew in separate clusters.</P>

delight... (all events repeated down to the latest development, each
fresh change being said to be due to 'wicked and unwholesome ways')
... [91] [92] and the rice grows in separate clusters. So now let us
divide up the rice into fields with boundaries.&quot; So they did so.</P>

enjoyed the fruits of it. So they seized hold of him and said:
&quot;You've done a wicked thing, taking another's plot like that!
Don't ever do such a thing again!&quot; &quot;I won't&quot;, he said,
but he did the same thing a second and a third time. Again he was
seized and rebuked, and some hit him with their fists, some with
stones, and some with sticks. And in this way, Vasettha, taking what

censure those who deserved it, and banish those who deserved
banishment! And in return, we would grant him a share of the rice.&quot;
