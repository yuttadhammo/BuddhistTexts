<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
[180] 1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha, at
the Squirrels' Feeding Place in the Bamboo Grove. And at that time
Sigalaka the householder's son, having got up early and gone out of
Rajagaha, was paying homage, with wet clothes and hair and with
joined palms, to the different directions: to the east, the south,
the west, the north, the nadir and the zenith.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. And the Lord, having risen early and dressed, took his robe and
bowl and went to Rajagaha for alms. And seeing Sigalaka paying homage
to the different directions, he said: 'Householder's son, why have
you got up early to [181] pay homage to the different directions?'
'Lord, my father, when he was dying, told me to do so. And so, Lord,
out of respect for my father's words, which I revere, honour and hold
sacred, I have got up thus early to pay homage in this way to the six
directions.' 'But, householder's son, that is not the right way to
pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline.'
'Well, Lord, how should one pay homage to the six directions
according to the Ariyan discipline? It would be good if the Blessed
Lord were to teach me the proper way to pay homage to the six
directions according to the Ariyan discipline.' 'Then listen
carefully, pay attention, and I will speak.' 'Yes, Lord', said
Sigalaka, and the Lord said:</P>

3. 'Young householder, it is by abandoning the four defilements of
action,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote963anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote963sym"><SUP>963</SUP></A></SUP>
by not doing evil from the four causes, by not following the six ways
of wasting one's substance<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote964anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote964sym"><SUP>964</SUP></A></SUP>
- through avoiding these fourteen evil ways - that the Ariyan
disciple covers the six directions, and by such practice becomes a
conqueror of both worlds, so that all will go well with him in this
world and the next, and at the breaking-up of the body after death he
will go to a good destiny, a heavenly world.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'What are the four defilements of action that are abandoned? Taking
life is one, taking what is not given is one, sexual misconduct is
one, lying speech is one. These are the four defilements of action
that he abandons.' Thus the Lord spoke.</P>

5. 'What are the four causes of evil from which he refrains? Evil
action springs from attachment, it springs from ill-will, it springs
from folly, it springs from fear. If the Ariyan disciple does not act
out of attachment, ill-will, folly or fear, he will not do evil from
any one of the four causes.' Thus the Lord spoke.</P>
