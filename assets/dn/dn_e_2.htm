Samannaphala Sutta: The Fruits of the Homeless Life</H2>

[47] 1. THus HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha, in
Jivaka Komarabhacca's<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote81anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote81sym"><SUP>81</SUP></A></SUP>
mango-grove, together with a large company of some twelve hundred and
fifty monks. And at that time King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote82anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote82sym"><SUP>82</SUP></A></SUP>
of Magadha, having gone up to the roof of his palace, was sitting
there surrounded by his ministers, on the fifteenth-day fast-day,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote83anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote83sym"><SUP>83</SUP></A></SUP>
the full-moon of the fourth month,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote84anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote84sym"><SUP>84</SUP></A></SUP>
called Komudi.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote85anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote85sym"><SUP>85</SUP></A></SUP>
And King Ajatasattu, on that fast-day, gave vent to this solemn
utterance: 'Delightful, friends, is this moonlight night! Charming is
this moonlight night! Auspicious is this moonlight night! Can we not
today visit some ascetic or Brahmin, to visit whom would bring peace
to our heart?'<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote86anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote86sym"><SUP>86</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
2. Then one minister said to King Ajatasattu: 'Sire, there is Purana
Kassapa, who has many followers, a teacher of many, who is
well-known, renowned, the founder of a sect, highly honoured by the
multitude, of long standing, long-since gone forth, aged and
venerable. May Your Majesty visit this Purana Kassapa. He may well
bring peace to Your Majesty's heart.' At these words King Ajatasattu
was silent.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
3. Another minister said: 'Sire, there is [48] Makkhali Gosala, who
has many followers ... He may well bring peace to your Majesty's
heart.' At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
4. Another minister said: 'Sire, there is Ajita Kesakambali ...' At

6. Another minister said: 'Sire, there is Sanjaya Belatthaputta...'
At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
7. Another minister said: 'Sire, there is [49] the Nigantha</P>

Nataputta, who has many followers, a teacher of many, who is

At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
8. All this time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently near King
Ajatasattu. The King said to him: 'You, friend Jivaka, why are you
silent?' 'Sire, there is this Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the
fully-enlightened Buddha staying in my mango-grove with a large
company of some twelve hundred and fifty monks. And concerning the
Blessed Gotama this fair report has been spread about: &quot;This
Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with
wisdom and conduct, the Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds,
incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed,<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote87anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote87sym"><SUP>87</SUP></A></SUP>
Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.&quot; May Your
Majesty visit the Blessed Lord. He may well bring peace to Your
Majesty's heart.&quot;Then, Jivaka, have the riding-elephants made
ready.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
9. 'Very good, Sire', said Jivaka, and he had five hundred
she-elephants made ready, and for the King the royal tusker. Then he
reported: 'Sire, the riding-elephants are ready. Now is the time to
do as Your Majesty wishes.' And King Ajatasattu, having placed his
wives each on one of the five hundred she-elephants, mounted the
royal tusker and proceeded in royal state, accompanied by
torch-bearers, from Rajagaha towards Jivaka's mango-grove.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
10. And when King Ajatasattu came near the mango-grove he felt fear
and terror, and his hair stood on end. And feeling [50] this fear and
the rising of the hairs, the King said to Jivaka: 'Friend Jivaka, you
are not deceiving me? You are not tricking me? You are not delivering
me up to an enemy? How is it that from this great number of twelve
hundred and fifty monks not a sneeze, a cough or a shout is to be
heard?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Have no fear, Your Majesty, I would not deceive you or trick you or
deliver you up to an enemy. Approach, Sire, approach. There are the
lights burning in the round pavilion.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
11. So King Ajatasattu, having ridden on his elephant as far as the
ground would permit, alighted and continued on foot to the door of
the round pavilion. Then he said: Jivaka, where is the Lord?' 'That
is the Lord, Sire. That is the Lord sitting against the middle column
with his order of monks in front of him.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
12. Then King Ajatasattu went up to the Lord and stood to one side,
and standing there to one side the King observed how the order of
monks continued in silence like a clear lake, and he exclaimed: 'If
only Prince Udayabhadda were possessed of such calm as this order of
monks!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Do your thoughts go to the one you love, Your Majesty?' 'Lord,
Prince Udayabhadda<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote88anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote88sym"><SUP>88</SUP></A></SUP>
is very dear to me. If only he were possessed of the same calm as
this order of monks!'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
13. Then King Ajatasattu, having bowed down to the Lord and saluted
the order of monks with [51] joined hands, sat down to one side and
said: 'Lord, I would ask something, if the Lord would deign to answer
me.' 'Ask, Your Majesty, anything you like.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
14. 'Lord, just as there are these various craftsmen, such as
elephant-drivers, horse-drivers, chariot-fighters, archers,
standard-bearers, adjutants, army caterers, champions and senior
officers, scouts, heroes, brave fighters, cuirassiers, slaves' sons,
cooks, barbers, bathmen, bakers, garland-makers, bleachers, weavers,
basket-makers, potters, calculators and accountants - and whatever
other skills there are: they enjoy here and now the visible fruits of
their skills, they themselves are delighted and pleased with this, as
are their parents, children and colleagues and friends, they maintain
and support ascetics and Brahmins, thus assuring for themselves a
heavenly, happy reward tending towards paradise. Can you, Lord, point
to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless
life?'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
15. 'Your Majesty, do you admit that you have put this question to
other ascetics and Brahmins?' 'I admit it, Lord.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
'Would Your Majesty mind saying how they replied?' 'I do not mind
telling the Lord, or one like him.' [52] 'Well then, Your Majesty,
tell me.'</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
i6. 'Once, Lord, I went to see Purana Kassapa.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote89anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote89sym"><SUP>89</SUP></A></SUP>
Having exchanged courtesies, I sat down to one side and said: &quot;Good
Kassapa, just as there are these various craftsmen,... they enjoy
here and now the visible fruits of their skills... (as verse 14). Can
you, Kassapa, point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit
of the homeless life?&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
17. 'At this, Lord, Purana Kassapa said: &quot;Your Majesty, by the
doer or instigator of a thing, by one who cuts or causes to be cut,
by one who burns or causes to be burnt, by one who causes grief and
weariness, by one who agitates or causes agitation, who causes life
to be taken or that which is not given to be taken, commits burglary,
carries off booty, commits robbery, lies in ambush, commits adultery
and tells lies, no evil is done. If with a razor-sharp wheel one were
to make of this earth one single mass and heap of flesh, there would
be no evil as a result of that, no evil would accrue. If one were to
go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, slaying, cutting or
causing to be cut, burning or causing to be burnt, there would be no
evil as a result of that, no evil would accrue. Or if one were to go
along the north bank of the Ganges giving and causing to be given,
sacrificing and causing to be sacrificed, there would be no merit as
a result of that, no merit would accrue. [53] In giving,
self-control, abstinence and telling the truth, there is no merit,
and no merit accrues.&quot;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0in">
18. 'Thus, Lord, Purana Kassapa, on being asked about the present
fruits of the homeless life, explained non-action to me. Just as if
on being asked about a mango he were to describe a breadfruit-tree,
or on being asked about a breadfruit-tree he were to describe a
mango, so Purana Kassapa, on being asked about the present fruits of
the homeless life, explained nonaction to me. And, Lord, I thought:
&quot;How should one like me think despitefully of any ascetic or
Brahmin dwelling in my territory?&quot;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote90anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote90sym"><SUP>90</SUP></A></SUP>
so I neither applauded nor rejected Purana Kassapa's words but,

beings, they are purified without cause or condition. There is no
self-power or other-power, there is no power in humans, no strength
or force, no vigour or exertion. All beings, all living things, all
creatures, all that lives is without control, without power or
strength, they experience the fixed course of pleasure and pain

Neither of these things is possible, because pleasure and pain have
been measured out with a measure limited by the round of
birth-and-death, and there is neither increase nor decrease, neither
excellence nor inferiority. Just as a ball of string when thrown runs

there are in the world no ascetics or Brahmins who have attained, who
have perfectly practised, who proclaim this world and the next,
having realised them by their own super-knowledge. This human being
is composed of the four great elements, and when one dies the earth
part reverts to earth, the water part to water, the fire part to
fire, the air part to air, and the faculties pass away into space.
They accompany the dead man with four bearers and the bier as fifth,
their footsteps are heard as far as the cremation-ground. There the
bones whiten, the sacrifice ends in ashes. It is the idea of a fool
to give this gift: the talk of those who preach a doctrine of
survival is vain and false. Fools and wise, at the breaking-up of the

slain nor slayer, neither hearer nor proclaimer, neither knower nor
