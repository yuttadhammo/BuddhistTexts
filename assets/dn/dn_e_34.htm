2.1. 'Eight things greatly help, eight things are to be developed (1)
'Which eight things greatly help? Eight causes, eight conditions
conduce to wisdom in the fundamentals of the holy life, to gaining
what has not been gained and to increasing, expanding and developing
what has been gained. Here, (a) one lives close to the Teacher or to
a fellow-monk with the standing of a teacher, being thus strongly
established in moral shame and moral dread, in love and veneration...
[285] He who is so placed (b) from time to time goes to his teacher,
asks and interrogates him: &quot;How is that, Lord? What does this
mean?&quot; Thus his venerable teachers can reveal what is hidden and
clarify obscurities, in this way helping him to solve his problems.
(c) Then, having heard Dhamma from them, he achieves withdrawal
(vupakasa),<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1142anc" HREF="notes.htm#sdfootnote1142sym"><SUP>1142</SUP></A></SUP>
of body and mind. (d) Further, a monk is moral, he lives restrained
according to the restraint of the discipline, persisting in right
behaviour, seeing danger in the slightest fault, and keeping to the
rules of training. Also, (e) a monk, having learnt much, remembers
and bears in mind what he has learnt, and those things that are
beautiful in the beginning, in the middle and in the ending, which in
spirit and letter proclaim the absolutely perfected and purified holy
life, he remembers and reflects on, and penetrates them with vision.
Again, (f) a monk, having stirred up energy, continues to dispel
unwholesome states, striving strongly and firmly, and not casting off
the yoke of the wholesome. [286] Again, (g) a monk is mindful, with
the highest mindfulness and discrimination, remembering and bearing
in mind what has been done or said in the past. Also, (h) a monk
continually contemplates the rise and fall of the five aggregates of
grasping, thinking: &quot;Such is material form, its arising and
passing; such are feelings, such are perceptions, such are the mental
formations, such is consciousness, its arising and passing.&quot;</P>
