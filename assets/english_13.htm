<DIV style="position:absolute;top:541;left:32"><nobr><span class="ft4420">How? If he wants to make himself or another visible even though hidden</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:558;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4426">or at&nbsp;a distance, he emerges from the basic jhāna and adverts thus, “Let this that<br>is dark become light” or “Let this that is hidden be revealed” or “Let this that has<br>not come into the visual field come into the visual field.” Then he does the<br>preliminary work&nbsp;and resolves in the way already described. It becomes as<br>resolved simultaneously with the resolve.&nbsp;Others then see even when at&nbsp;a distance;<br>and he himself sees too, if he wants to see.</span></nobr></DIV>

But although they become manifold in this way by&nbsp;being made the object<br>in different modes of appearance, nevertheless it is only a single resolution<br>consciousness that occurs. This is its power.&nbsp;For it is like the single volition that<br>produces a personality possessed of many different facets (see Ch. XIV, n. 14). And<br>there it is the aspiration to become that is a condition for the differentiation in the<br>kamma; and kamma-result is imponderable. And here too it is the preliminary-work<br>consciousness that should be taken as a condition for the difference. And the field of<br>supernormal power is imponderable too.” (Vism-mhṭ 390)<br>13. Certain grammatical problems arise about the case of the words&nbsp;<i>āvibhāvaṃ</i>, etc.,<br>both in the sutta passage and (more so) in the Paṭisambhidā passage; they are examined<br>by&nbsp;Vism-mhṭ (p. 390) but are not renderable into English.</span></nobr></DIV>

When the Blessed One, it seems, had performed the Twin<br>Miracle15&nbsp;and had liberated eighty-four thousand beings from bonds, he<br>wondered, “Where did the past Enlightened Ones go to when they had finished<br>the Twin Miracle?” He saw that they had gone to the heaven of the Thirty-three.<br>[391] Then he stood with one foot on the surface of the earth, and placed the<br>second on Mount Yugandhara. Then again he lifted his first foot and set it on<br>the summit of Mount Sineru. He took up the residence for the Rains there on the<br>Red Marble Terrace, and he began his exposition of the Abhidhamma, starting<br>from the beginning, to the deities of ten thousand world-spheres. At&nbsp;the time for<br>wandering for alms he created an artificial Buddha to teach the Dhamma.</span></nobr></DIV>

Then, after collecting alms food<br>among the Uttarakurus, he would eat it on the shores of that lake.&nbsp;[Each day] the<br>Elder Sāriputta went there and paid homage to the Blessed One, who told him,<br>“Today I taught this much Dhamma,” and he gave&nbsp;him the method. In this way<br>he gave&nbsp;an uninterrupted exposition of the Abhidhamma for three months. Eighty<br>million deities penetrated the Dhamma on hearing it.</span></nobr></DIV>

Then, saying, “We will disperse when we&nbsp;have&nbsp;seen the Blessed<br>One,” they made an encampment and waited there. Anāthapiṇḍika the Lesser16<br>supplied all their needs.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:323;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4506">110.&nbsp;The venerable Raṭṭhapāla said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, standing<br>in this place formerly I used to see Sineru and the ramparts of Sineru,19&nbsp;and the<br>Thirty-three, and the Vejayanta Palace, and the flag over the Vejayanta Palace.<br>Venerable sir, what&nbsp;is the cause, what&nbsp;is the reason, why I now see neither Sineru<br>nor … the flag over the Vejayanta Palace?”—“This royal nāga called<br>Nandopananda is angry with us, Raṭṭhapāla. He has surrounded Sineru seven<br>times with his coils, and he stands there covering us with his raised hood,<br>making it dark.”—“I will tame him, venerable sir.” But the Blessed One would<br>not allow it. Then the venerable Bhaddiya and the venerable Rāhula and all the<br>bhikkhus in turn offered to do so, but the Blessed One would not allow it.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:502;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4506">111.&nbsp;Last of all the venerable Mahā Moggallāna said, “I will tame him, venerable<br>sir.” The Blessed One allowed it, saying, “Tame him, Moggallāna.” The elder<br>abandoned that form and assumed the form of a huge royal nāga, and he<br>surrounded Nandopananda fourteen times with his coils and raised his hood<br>above&nbsp;the other’s hood, and he squeezed him against Sineru. The royal nāga<br>produced smoke.&nbsp;[400] The elder said, “There is smoke not only in your body but<br>also in mine,” and he produced smoke.&nbsp;The royal nāga’s smoke did not distress<br>the elder,&nbsp;but the elder’s smoke distressed the royal nāga. Then the royal nāga<br>produced flames. The elder said, “There is fire not only in your body but also in<br>mine,” and he produced flames. The royal nāga’s fire did not distress the elder,<br>but the elder’s fire distressed the royal nāga.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:145;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4515">113.&nbsp;The Blessed One said, “Moggallāna, Moggallāna, beware; this is a<br>mighty nāga.” The elder said, “Venerable sir, the four roads to power have&nbsp;been<br>developed by&nbsp;me, repeatedly practiced, made the vehicle, made the basis,<br>established, consolidated, and properly undertaken. I can tame not only<br>Nandopananda, venerable sir, but a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand<br>royal nāgas like Nandopananda.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4515">114.&nbsp;The royal nāga thought, “When he went in the first place I did not see<br>him. But now when he comes out I shall catch him between my fangs and chew<br>him up.” Then he said, “Venerable sir, come out. Do not keep troubling me by<br>walking up and down inside my belly.” The elder came out and stood outside.<br>The royal nāga recognized him, and blew&nbsp;a blast from his nose.

The<br>other bhikkhus would, it seems, have&nbsp;been able to perform all the miracles up to<br>now,&nbsp;but at&nbsp;this point they could not have&nbsp;attained with so rapid a response,<br>which is why the Blessed One would not allow them to tame the royal nāga.</span></nobr></DIV>

[401] The royal nāga abandoned<br>that form, and having assumed the form of a young brahman, he said, “Venerable<br>sir, I go for refuge to you,” and he paid homage at&nbsp;the elder’s feet. The elder said,<br>“The Master has come, Nanda; come, let us go to him.” So having tamed the royal<br>nāga and deprived him of his poison, he went with him to the Blessed One’s presence.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:558;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4515">116.&nbsp;The royal nāga paid homage to the Blessed One and said, “Venerable sir,<br>I go for refuge to you.” The Blessed One said, “May you be happy,&nbsp;royal nāga.”<br>Then he went, followed by&nbsp;the Community of Bhikkhus, to Anāthapiṇḍika’s<br>house. Anāthapiṇḍika said, “Venerable sir, why have&nbsp;you come so late?”—“There<br>was a battle between Moggallāna and Nandopananda.”—“Who won, venerable<br>sir?

If this possessor of<br>supernormal power,&nbsp;having reached mental mastery, wants to go to the Brahmā-<br>world with a visible body, he converts his mind to accord with his body, he<br>resolves his mind to accord with his body.

Herein, just as when a pint measure (<i>āḷhaka</i>) of milk is poured into a number<br>of pints of water, though the milk becomes completely mixed up with the water, and is<br>present appreciably in all, it is nevertheless not the milk that has increased there, but<br>only the water. And so too, although the clung-to and unclung-to occur mixed up<br>together, it is nevertheless not the clung-to that is enlarged. It should be taken that it<br>is the consciousness-born matter that is enlarged by&nbsp;the influence of the supernormal<br>power,&nbsp;and the temperature-born is enlarged&nbsp;<i>pari passu</i>” (Vism-mhṭ 395).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:489;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4533">123.&nbsp;Furthermore, the Elder Cūḷa Samudda did it as well in Tambapaṇṇi Island.<br>During a time of scarcity, it seems,&nbsp;seven hundred bhikkhus came to the elder<br>one morning. The elder thought, “Where can a large community of bhikkhus<br>wander for alms?” He saw nowhere at&nbsp;all in Tambapaṇṇi Island, but he saw that<br>it would be possible on the other shore at&nbsp;Pāṭaliputta (Patna). He got the bhikkhus<br>to take their bowls and [outer] robes, and he said, “Come friends, let us go<br>wandering for alms.” Then he abridged the earth and went to Pāṭaliputta. The<br>bhikkhus asked, “What is the city, venerable sir?”—“It is Pāṭaliputta, friends.”—<br>“Pāṭaliputta is far away, venerable sir.”—“Friends, experienced elders make what<br>is far near.”—“Where is the ocean (<i>mahā-samudda</i>), venerable sir?”—“Friends,<br>did you not cross a blue stream on the way as you came?”—“Yes, venerable sir,<br>but the ocean is vast.”—“Friends, experienced elders also make what&nbsp;is vast<br>small.”</span></nobr></DIV>

Thinking, “He is<br>our elder,” they each took a cake and approached the elder. The elder took out<br>his bowl and made a single bowlful of them all. The Blessed One had sat down<br>first to await the elder. The elder brought them and gave&nbsp;them to the Blessed One.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:162;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4543">127.&nbsp;In&nbsp;the story of the rich man Illīsa, however,&nbsp;(J-a I 348; Dhp-a I 372) the Elder<br>Mahā Moggallāna made little much. And in the story of Kākavaḷiya the Blessed<br>One did so. The Elder Mahā Kassapa, it seems, after spending seven days in<br>attainment, stood at&nbsp;the house door of a man in poor circumstances called<br>Kākavaḷiya in order to show favour to the poor. [404] His wife saw the elder, and<br>she poured into his bowl the unsalted sour gruel that she had cooked for her<br>husband. The elder took it and placed it in the Blessed One’s hand. The Blessed<br>One resolved to make it enough for the Greater Community of Bhikkhus. What<br>was brought in a single bowl became enough for all. And on the seventh day<br>Kākavaḷiya became a rich man.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:341;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4543">128.&nbsp;And not only in the case of making little much, but whatever the possessor<br>of supernormal power wishes, whether to make the sweet unsweet, etc., it is<br>successful for him. For so it was that when the Elder Mahā Anula saw many<br>bhikkhus sitting on the banks of the Gaṅgā River [in Sri Lanka] eating plain rice,<br>which was all that they had got after doing their alms round, he resolved, “Let<br>the Gaṅgā River water be cream of ghee,” and he gave&nbsp;a sign to the novices. They<br>fetched it in their vessels and gave&nbsp;it to the Community of Bhikkhus. All of them<br>ate their meal with sweet cream of ghee.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:541;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4543">130.&nbsp;<i>He converts his mind according to his body</i>: he converts the mind to accord<br>with the material body; taking the consciousness of the basic jhāna, he mounts<br>it upon the body, he makes its going slow to coincide with that of the body; for<br>the body’s mode of going is slow.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:615;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4543">131.&nbsp;<i>He arrives at&nbsp;blissful perception and light perception</i>: he arrives at, enters,<br>makes contact with, reaches, the perception of bliss and perception of lightness<br>that are conascent with the consciousness whose object is the basic jhāna. And<br>it is perception associated with equanimity that is called “perception of bliss”;<br>for equanimity is called “bliss” since it is peaceful. And that same perception<br>should be understood to be called “perception of lightness” too because it is<br>liberated from hindrances and from the things that oppose it beginning with<br>applied thought. But when he arrives at&nbsp;that state, his physical body too becomes<br>as light as a tuft of cotton. He goes to the Brahmā-world thus with a visible body<br>as light as a tuft of cotton wafted by&nbsp;the wind.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:794;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4543">132.&nbsp;As&nbsp;he&nbsp;goes thus, if he wishes, he creates a path in space by&nbsp;means of the<br>earth kasiṇa and goes on foot. If he wishes, he resolves by&nbsp;means of the air kasiṇa<br>that there shall be air, and he goes by&nbsp;air like a tuft of cotton. Moreover,&nbsp;the desire<br>to go is the measure here. When there is the desire to go, one who has made his<br>mental resolve in this way goes visibly, carried by&nbsp;the force of the resolution like<br>an arrow&nbsp;shot by&nbsp;an archer.

He makes its going swift to coincide with that of the mind; for the<br>mind’s mode of going is swift.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:145;left:18"><nobr><span class="ft4552"><i>He arrives at&nbsp;blissful perception and light perception</i>: he arrives at&nbsp;perception</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:162;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4556">of bliss and perception of lightness that are conascent with the supernormal-<br>power consciousness whose object is the material body. The rest should be<br>understood in the way already described. But here there is only the going of<br>consciousness.21</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:236;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4556">134.&nbsp;When it was asked, “As he goes with an invisible body thus, does he<br>go at&nbsp;the moment of the resolution-consciousness’s arising or at&nbsp;the moment<br>of its presence or at&nbsp;the moment of its dissolution?”, an elder replied, “He<br>goes in all three moments.”—“But does he go himself, or does he send a<br>creation?”—“He does as he pleases. But here it is only the going himself that<br>has been given [in the text].”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:345;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4557">135.&nbsp;<i>Mind-made</i>: mind-made because created by&nbsp;the mind in resolution.&nbsp;<i>Lacking<br>no faculty</i>: this refers to the shape of the eye,&nbsp;ear, etc.; but there is no sensitivity in</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:410;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4558">21. “‘<i>There is only the going of consciousness</i>’: there is only a going that is the same as<br>that of the mind. But how does the body, whose going [being that of matter] is slow,<br>come to have&nbsp;the same going as the mind, which quickly passes? Its going is not the<br>same in all respects; for in the case of converting the mind to conform with the body,<br>the mind does not come to have&nbsp;the same going as the body in all respects. For it is not<br>that the mind then occurs with the moment of a material state, which passes slowly,<br>instead of passing with its own kind of moment, which is what&nbsp;establishes its individual<br>essence. But rather the mind is called ‘converted to accord with the going of the body’<br>as long as it goes on occurring in a continuity that conforms with the body until the<br>desired place is arrived at. This is because its passing occurs parallel with that of the<br>body, whose going is slow,&nbsp;owing to the resolution, ‘Let the mind be like&nbsp;this body.’<br>And likewise, it is while the body keeps occurring in suchwise that its arrival at&nbsp;the<br>desired place comes about in only a few quick passes of the mind instead of passing<br>slowly, as in those who have&nbsp;not developed the roads to power—and this mode of<br>occurrence is due to the possession of the perception of lightness, to say nothing of<br>the resolve,&nbsp;‘Let this body be like this mind’—that the body is called ‘converted to<br>accord with the going of the mind,’ not because it arrives at&nbsp;the desired place in a<br>single consciousness moment. And when taken thus the simile, ‘Just as a strong man<br>might stretch out his bent arm, or bend his outstretched arm’ (Vin I 5) can be taken<br>literally. And this must be accepted in this way without reserve,&nbsp;otherwise there is<br>conflict with the Suttas, the Abhidhamma and the Commentary, as well as contradiction<br>of natural law (<i>dhammatā</i>). ‘Bhikkhus, I see no other one thing that is so quickly<br>transformed as the mind’ (A I 10)—here it is material states that are referred to by&nbsp;the<br>word ‘other’ because they do not pass quickly. And in the Abhidhamma only matter<br>is called prenascence condition and only consciousness postnascence condition. And<br>wherever states (<i>dhamma</i>) arise, there they dissolve.&nbsp;There is no transmigration to an<br>adjacent location (<i>desantara-saṅkamana</i>), nor does the individual essence become other.<br>For it is not possible to effect any alteration of the characteristics of dhammas by<br>force of the roads to power.&nbsp;But it is possible to effect alteration of the mode in which<br>they are present (<i>bhāva</i>)” (Vism-mhṭ 397).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:162;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4566">136.&nbsp;When this possessor of supernormal power,&nbsp;while remaining here sees a<br>visible object with the divine eye,&nbsp;hears a sound with the divine ear element,<br>knows consciousness with the penetration of minds, he does not wield bodily<br>power in doing that. And when, while remaining here, he stands with that<br>Brahmā, converses, enters into communication with that Brahmā, he does not<br>wield bodily power in doing that. And when he makes his resolve described in<br>the way beginning “though far, he resolves upon nearness,” he does not wield<br>bodily power in doing that. And when he goes to the Brahmā-world with a<br>visible or an invisible body, he does not wield bodily power in doing that. But<br>when he enters upon the process described in the way beginning, “He creates a<br>visible form before that Brahmā, mind-made,” then he wields bodily power in<br>doing that. The rest, however,&nbsp;is said here for the purpose of showing the stage<br>prior to the wielding of the bodily power.&nbsp;This, firstly, is (i) success by&nbsp;resolve<br>(§45).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:410;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4566">137.&nbsp;The difference between (i) success as transformation and (ii) success as<br>the mind-made [body], is as follows (see §22, 24, 25, 45).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:450;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft4560">(i) One, firstly, who performs a transformation [406] should resolve upon</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:467;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4566">whatever he chooses from among the things beginning with the appearance of<br>a boy,&nbsp;described as follows: “He abandons his normal appearance and shows<br>the appearance of a boy or the appearance of a nāga (serpent), or the appearance<br>of a supaṇṇa (winged demon), or the appearance of an asura (demon), or the<br>appearance of the Ruler [of Gods] (Indra), or the appearance of some [other<br>sensual-sphere] deity, or the appearance of a Brahmā, or the appearance of the<br>sea, or the appearance of a rock, or the appearance of a lion, or the appearance<br>of a tiger, or the appearance of a leopard, or he shows an elephant, or he shows<br>a horse, or he shows a chariot, or he shows a foot soldier, or he shows a manifold<br>military array” (Paṭis II 210).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:645;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4566">138.&nbsp;And when he resolves he should emerge from the fourth jhāna that is the<br>basis for direct-knowledge and has one of the things beginning with the earth<br>kasiṇa as its object, and he should advert to his own appearance as a boy.&nbsp;After<br>adverting and finishing the preliminary work, he should attain again and<br>emerge, and he should resolve thus: “Let me be a boy of such and such a type.”<br>Simultaneously with the resolve consciousness he becomes the boy,&nbsp;just as<br>Devadatta did (Vin I 185; Dhp-a I 139). This is the method in all instances. But&nbsp;<i>he<br>shows an elephant</i>, etc., is said here with respect to showing an elephant, etc.,<br>externally. Herein, instead of resolving, “Let me be an elephant,” he resolves,<br>“Let there be an elephant.” The same method applies in the case of the horse<br>and the rest.</span></nobr></DIV>

Hence it is said: “Here a bhikkhu creates from this body another<br>body possessing visible form, mind-made, with all its limbs, lacking no faculty.<br>Just as though a man pulled out a reed from its sheath and thought thus: ‘This<br>is the sheath; this is the reed; the sheath is one, the reed is another, it was from the<br>sheath that the reed was pulled out’” (Paṭis II 210), and so on.
