<p>[169] "<i>Take thought of life hereafter</i>." This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana about the offering of a sacrifice under vow to gods. Tradition says that in those days folk when going a journey on business, used to slay living creatures and offer them as a sacrifice to gods, and set out on their way, after making this vow,--"If we come safely back with a profit, we will give you another sacrifice." And when they did come safely back with a profit, the Idea that this was all due to gods made them slay a number of living creatures and offer them up as a sacrifice to obtain a release from their vow.</p>  
<p>When the Brethren became aware of this, they asked the Blessed One, saying, "Can there be any good in this, sir?"</p>  
<p>The Blessed One told this story of the past.</p>

<p>Once on a time in the K&#257;si country the squire of a certain little village had promised a sacrifice to the Fairy of a banyan-tree which stood at the entrance to the village. Afterwards when he returned, he slew a number</p>

<p>of creatures and betook himself to the tree to get released from his vow. But the Tree-Fairy, standing in the fork of its tree, repeated this stanza:--</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Take thought of life hereafter when you seek<br> 'Release'; for this release is bondage strict.<br> Not thus the wise and good release themselves;<br> For this, the fool's release, in bondage ends.</div></p>  
<p>Thenceforth, men refrained from such taking of life, and by walking in righteousness thronged thereafter the city of the Devas.</p>

<p>His lesson ended, the Master shewed the connexion and identified the Birth, by saying, "I was the Tree-fairy of those days."</p>
