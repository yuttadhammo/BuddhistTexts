<p>"<i>Their heart's desire</i>."--This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana about a Brother who gave up persevering. In this J&#257;taka both the Introductory Story and the Story of the Past will be given in the Eleventh Book in connexion with the Sa&#7747;vara-j&#257;taka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;--the incidents are the same both for that J&#257;taka and for this, but the stanzas are different.</p>

<p>contemplated his glory and thought--"All this glory I owe to my teacher." And, in his joy, he burst into this heartfelt utterance:--</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Their heart's desire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they reap, who hurry not;<br> Know, G&#257;mani, ripe excellence is thine.</div></p>  
<p>[137] Seven or eight days after he had become king, all his brothers departed to their own homes. King G&#257;mani, after ruling his kingdom in righteousness, passed away to fare according to his deserts. The Bodhisatta also passed away to fare according to his deserts.</p>

<p>His lesson ended, the Master preached the Truths, at the close whereof the faint-hearted Brother won Arahatship. Having told the two stories, the Master shewed the connexion linking them both together and identified the Birth.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_41"></A><A HREF="#fr_41">30:1</A> As to the alternative of the gloss ("phal&#257;s&#257; ti &#257;s&#257;phalam," <i>i.e.</i> "'the desire of the fruit' means 'the fruit of the desire'") Professor K&uuml;nte (Ceylon R. A. S. J. 1884) says--"the inversion requires a knowledge of metaphysical grammar such as was not cultivated in India before the 6th century A.D. ..&#7788;he gloss was written about the Brahminical and Jain revival."</P>
