<p><i>"Our old friend," etc.</i>&#8212;The Master told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a greedy Brother. The occasion is as above.</p>

<p>Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a pigeon and lived in a nest-basket in the kitchen of a</p>

The cook pulled out the crow's feathers and sprinkled him with flour, then piercing a cowrie he hung it on the crow's neck and threw him into a basket. The Bodhisatta came from the wood, and seeing him made a jest and spoke the first stanza:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Our old friend! look at him!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jewel bright he wears;<br> His beard in gallant trim,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How gay our friend appears!</div></small></p>  
<p>[315] The crow hearing him spoke the second stanza:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">My nails and hair had grown so fast,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hampered me in all I did:<br> A barber came along at last,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of superfluous hair I'm rid.</div></small></p>  
<p>Then the Bodhisatta spoke the third stanza:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Granted you got a barber then,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has cropped your hair so well:<br> Round your neck, will you explain,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's that tinkling like a bell?</div></small></p>  
<p>Then the crow uttered two stanzas:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Men of fashion wear a gem<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the neck: it's often done:<br> I am imitating them:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't suppose it's just for fun.</div></small></p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">If you're really envious<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my beard that's trimmed so true:<br> I can get you barbered thus;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have the jewel too.</div></small></p>  
<p>The Bodhisatta hearing him spoke the sixth stanza:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Nay, &#8217;tis you they best become,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gem and beard that's trimmed so true.<br> I find your presence troublesome:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go with a good-day to you.</div></small></p>  
<p>[316] With these words he flew up and went elsewhere; and the crow died then and there.</p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths and identified the Birth:&#8212;After the Truths, the greedy Brother was established in the fruition of the Third Path: "At that time the crow was the greedy Brother, the pigeon was myself."</p>
