</TABLE>

<P>These eight conditions were all united in him when he made his earnest wish at the feet of D&icirc;pamkara, saying,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>"Come now! I'll search that I may find<BR>
Conditions which a Buddha make."<BR></TD></TR>

<P>Thereupon, putting forth a strenuous effort,--as it is said,--</P>

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>"And then I searched, and found the First<BR>
Perfection, which consists in alms,"--<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>he discovered, not only the perfection which is called alms, but also all the others that go to make a Buddha. And in fulfilling them he reached his Vessantara existence.<A NAME="page_33_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_33_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> In so doing, all the blessings celebrated in the following stanzas as belonging to Future Buddhas who make the earnest wish were attained by him:--</P>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in accomplishing these Ten Perfections there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of almsgiving; as when he was born as the Brahman Akitti, the Brahman Samkha, king Dhana&ntilde;jaya, Mah&acirc;-Sudassana, Mah&acirc;-Govinda, king Nimi, prince Canda, Visayha the treasurer, king Sivi, and king Vessantara. But the acme was reached when as the Wise Hare<A NAME="page_35_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_35_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>259. </TD><TD>"There came a beggar, asked for food;<BR>
Myself I gave that he might eat.<BR>
In alms there's none can equal me;<BR>
In alms have I perfection reached."<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>Thus, in this offering up of his own life, he acquired the perfection of almsgiving in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the precepts; as when he was born as the elephant-king S&icirc;lava, the snake-king Campeyya, the snake-king Bh&ucirc;ridatta, the elephant-king Chaddanta, and prince Al&icirc;nasattu, son of king Jayaddisa. But the acme was reached when, as related in the Samkhap&acirc;la Birth-Story, he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>260. </TD><TD>"They pierced me through with pointed stakes,<BR>
They hacked me with their hunting-knives;<BR>
Yet gainst these Bhojans raged I not,<BR>
But kept the precepts perfectly."<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>Thus, in giving up his own life, he acquired perfection in the keeping of the precepts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of abnegation by abandoning</P>

<TABLE WIDTH="100%">
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD ALIGN="left"><A NAME="page_36"><FONT COLOR=GREEN SIZE=1>p. 36</FONT></A></TD>

</TABLE>

<P>his throne; as when he was born as prince Somanassa, prince Hatthip&acirc;la, and the pandit Ayoghara. But the acme was reached when, as related in the Lesser Sutasoma Birth-Story, he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>261. </TD><TD>"A kingdom dropped into my hands;<BR>
Like spittle vile I let it fall,<BR>
Nor for it felt the smallest wish,<BR>
And thus renunciation gained."<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>Thus, free from attachment, he renounced a kingdom and retired from the world, and by so doing acquired the perfection of abnegation in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of knowledge; as when he was born as the pandit Vidh&ucirc;ra, the pandit Mah&acirc;-Govinda, the pandit Kudd&acirc;la, the pandit Araka, the wandering ascetic Bodhi, and the pandit Mahosadha. But the acme was reached when, as the pandit Senaka of the Sattubhatta Birth-Story, he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>262. </TD><TD>"With wisdom sifted I the case,<BR>
And freed the Brahman from his woe;<BR>
In wisdom none can equal me:<BR>
In wisdom I've perfection reached,"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>and displayed to all present the serpent which lay concealed in the bag, and in so doing acquired the perfection of wisdom in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of courage. But the acme was reached when, as related in the Greater Janaka Birth-Story, he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>263. </TD><TD>"Far out of sight of land were we,<BR>
The crew were all as dead of fright;<BR>
Yet still unruffled was my mind:<BR>
In courage I've perfection reached."<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>Thus it was in crossing the ocean he acquired the perfection of courage in its highest degree.</P>

<TD ALIGN="right"><SMALL>[J.i.46<SUP>17</SUP></SMALL></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise in the Khantiv&acirc;da Birth-Story, where he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>264. </TD><TD>"Like one insensible I lay,<BR>
While with his hatchet keen he hacked,<BR>
Nor raged I gainst Benares' king:<BR>
In patience I've perfection reached,"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>in enduring great suffering, while appearing to be unconscious, he acquired the perfection of patience in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise in the Greater Sutasoma Birth-Story, where he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>265. </TD><TD>"I kept the promise I had made,<BR>
And gave my life in sacrifice,<BR>
A hundred warriors set I free:<BR>
In truth have I perfection reached,"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>in keeping his word at the sacrifice of his life, he acquired the perfection of truth in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise in the M&ucirc;gapakkha Birth-Story, where he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>266. </TD><TD>"'T is not that I my parents hate,<BR>
'T is not that glory I detest,<BR>
But since omniscience I held dear,<BR>
Therefore I kept my firm resolve,"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>in resolving on a course of conduct that cost him his life, he acquired the perfection of resolution in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise in the Ekar&acirc;ja Birth-Story, where he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>267. </TD><TD>"No fear has any one of me,<BR>
Nor have I fear of any one,<BR>
In my good-will to all I trust,<BR>
And love to dwell in lonely woods,"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>in the exercise of feelings of good-will, and in taking no thought for his life, he acquired the perfection of good-will in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise in the Lomahamsa Birth-Story, where he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>268. </TD><TD>"I laid me down among the dead,<BR>
A pillow of their bones I made;<BR>
While from the villages around,<BR>
Some came to mock, and some to praise,"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<!--------------------------p. 38-------------------------->

<TABLE WIDTH="100%">
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD ALIGN="left"><A NAME="page_38"><FONT COLOR=GREEN SIZE=1>p. 38</FONT></A></TD>
<TD ALIGN="right"><SMALL>[J.i.47<SUP>9</SUP></SMALL></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>while village children flocked about him, and some spat and others showered fragrant garlands upon him, he was indifferent alike to pleasure and pain, and acquired the perfection of indifference in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is an abridgment, but the full account is given in the Cariy&acirc;-Pitaka.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having thus fulfilled all the perfections, he said, in his existence as Vessantara,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>269. </TD><TD>"This earth, unconscious though she be,<BR>
And ignorant of joy or grief,<BR>
E'en she then felt alms' mighty power,<BR>
And shook and quaked full seven times."<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>And having thus caused the earth to quake by his mighty deeds of merit, at the end of that existence he died, and was reborn in the Tusita heaven.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly the period from the time when he fell at the feet of D&icirc;pamkara to his birth in the city of the Tusita gods constitutes the Distant Epoch.</P>

The stanza quoted, however, is not taken from that account, but from another work called the Cariy&acirc;-Pitaka, which is wholly in poetry. The Cariy&acirc;-Pitaka consists of Birth-Stories, and besides the Wise Hare, gives several others of those here mentioned. Some are also briefly alluded to in the ninth chapter of the Visuddhi-Magga; but of course the great treasure-house for Birth-Stories is the J&acirc;taka itself.</P>
