<p><i>"You were never," etc.</i>&#8212;The Master told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a certain Brother. The story is that the Brother had left Jetavana and dwelt in the Kosala kingdom near a certain wood: one day he went down into a lotus-pool [308], and seeing a lotus in flower he stood to leeward and smelt</p>

<p>it. Then the goddess who dwelt in that part of the forest frightened him saying, "Sir, you are a thief of odours, this is a kind of theft." He went back in a fright to Jetavana, and saluted the Master and sat down. "Where have you been staying, Brother?" "In such and such a wood, and the goddess frightened me in such and such a way." The Master said, "You are not the first who have been frightened by a goddess when smelling a flower; sages of old have been frightened in like manner," and at the Brother's request he told an old tale.</p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born in a brahmin family of a village in K&#257;si: when he grew up he learned the arts at Takkasil&#257;, and afterwards became an ascetic and lived near a lotus-pool. One day he went down into the pool and stood smelling a lotus in full flower. A goddess who was in a hollow in a trunk of a tree alarming him spoke the first stanza:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">You were never given that flower you smell, though it's only a single bloom;<br> &#8217;Tis a species of larceny, reverend sir, you are stealing its perfume.</div></small></p>  
<p>Then the Bodhisatta spoke the second stanza:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">I neither take nor break the flower: from afar I smell the bloom.<br> I cannot tell on what pretence you say I steal perfume.</div></small></p>  
<p>At the same moment a man was digging in the pool for lotus-fibres and breaking the lotus-plants. The Bodhisatta seeing him said, "You call a man thief if he smells the flower from afar: [309] why do you not speak to that other man?" So in talk with her he spoke the third stanza:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">A man who digs the lotus-roots and breaks the stalks I see:<br> Why don't you call the conduct of that man disorderly?</div></small></p>  
<p>The goddess, explaining why she did not speak to him, spoke the fourth and fifth stanzas:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Disgusting like a nurse's dress are men disorderly:<br> I have no speech with men like him, but I deign to speak to thee.</p>  
<p>When a man is free from evil stains and seeks for purity,<br> A sin like a hair-tip shows on him like a dark cloud in the sky.</div></small></p>  
<p>So alarmed by her the Bodhisatta in emotion spoke the sixth stanza:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Surely, fairy, you know me well, to pity me you deign:<br> If you see me do the like offence, pray speak to me again.</div></small></p>  
<p>Then the goddess spoke to him the seventh stanza:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">I am not here to serve you, no hireling folk are we:<br> Find, Brother, for yourself the path to reach felicity.</div></small></p>  
<p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="green">p. 193</font></A></p>  
<p>[310] So exhorting him she entered her own abode. The Bodhisatta entered on high meditation and was born in the Brahmaloka world.</p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>The lesson ended, the Master declared the Truths, and identified the Birth:&#8212;at the end of the Truths, the Brother was established in the fruit of the First Path:&#8212;"At that time the goddess was Uppalava&#7751;&#7751;&#257;, the ascetic myself."</p>
