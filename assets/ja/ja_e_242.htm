<p>"<i>See that twice-born bird</i>," <i>etc</i>.--This story the Master told while staying in Jetavana, about a hypocrite. When he was brought before the Master, the Master said, "Brethren, he was a hypocrite of old just as he is now," and told the following story.</p>

<p>[234] Once on a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a Fish in a certain pond in the Himalaya region, and a great shoal went with him. Now a Crane desired to eat the fish. So in a place near the pond he drooped his head, and spread out his wings, and looked vacantly, vacantly at the fish, waiting till they were off their guard&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. At the same moment the Bodhisatta with his shoal came to that place in search of food. And the shoal of fish on seeing the crane uttered the first stanza:--</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"See that twice-born&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> bird, how white--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like a water-lily seeming;<br> Wings outspread to left and right--<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, how pious! dreaming, dreaming!"</small></div></p>  
<p>Then the Bodhisatta looked, and uttered the second stanza:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"What he is ye do not know,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Or you would not sing his praises.<br> He is our most treacherous foe;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That is why no wing he raises."</small></div></p>  
<p>Thereupon the fish splashed in the water and drove the crane away.</p>

<p>When this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth:--"This hypocrite was the Crane, and I was the chief of the shoal of fish."</p>
