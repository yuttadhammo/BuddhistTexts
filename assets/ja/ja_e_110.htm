<p>"<i>From four to eight</i>."--This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, concerning an unruly Brother. The incidents are the same as those in the previous story of Mittavindaka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, but belong to the days of the Buddha Kassapa.</p>

<p>[414] Now at that time one of the damned who had put on the circlet and was suffering the tortures of hell, asked the Bodhisatta--"Lord, what sin have I committed?" The Bodhisatta detailed the man's evil deeds to hire and uttered this stanza:--</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">From four to eight, to sixteen thence, and so<br> To thirty-two insatiate greed doth go,<br> --Still pressing on till insatiety<br> Doth win the circlet's griding misery&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</div></p>
