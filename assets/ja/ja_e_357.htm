<p>[153] <i>"Stript of all the joys of life," etc.</i>&#8212;This story the Master, while dwelling at Jetavana, told concerning a councillor who was guilty of misconduct in the harem of the king of Kosala. The incident that gave rise to the story has been given in full before.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p>Here too the Bodhisatta became king in Benares. The wicked councillor called in the king of Kosala and got him to seize upon the kingdom of K&#257;si, and to throw the Bodhisatta into prison. The king of Benares developed ecstatic meditation and sat cross-legged in the air. A fierce heat sprang up in the body of the marauding king, and he drew nigh to the king of Benares and repeated the first stanza:</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Stript of all the joys of life,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewelled earrings, horse and car,<br> Robbed of child and loving wife,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought thy pleasure seems to mar.</div></small></p>  
<p>[154] On hearing him the Bodhisatta recited these verses:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Pleasures soon make haste to leave us,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pleasures soon must all forego,<br> Sorrow has no power to grieve us,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy itself soon turns to woe.<br> Moons with new-born orb appearing<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wax awhile, to wane and die,<br> Suns with warmth all nature cheering,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haste to set in yonder sky.<br> Change is this world's law I see,<br> Sorrow has no pangs for me.</div></small></p>

<p>Thus now did the Great Being expound the Truth to the usurper king, and bringing his conduct to the test, repeated these stanzas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">The idle sensual layman I detest,<br> The false ascetic is a rogue confest.</p>  
<p>A bad king will a case unheard decide;<br> Wrath in the sage can ne&#8217;er be justified.</p>  
<p>The warrior prince a well-weighed verdict gives,<br> Of righteous judge the fame for ever lives.</div></small></p>  
<p>[155] The king of Kosala having thus gained the forgiveness of the Bodhisatta and given him back his kingdom, departed to his own country.</p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>The Master, having ended his discourse, thus identified the Birth: "At that time &#256;nanda was the king of Kosala, and I myself was the king of Benares."</p>
