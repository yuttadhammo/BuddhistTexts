<p>"<i>Who sagely meditates</i>."--This story too was told by the Master while at Jetavana about the interpretation of a problem by the Elder S&#257;riputta at the gate of Sa&#7745;kassa.</p>  
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>  
<p>Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta, as he expired in his forest-home, answered his disciples' enquiries with the words--"Moonlight and Sunlight." With these words he died and passed to the Radiant Realm.</p>  
<p>Now when the chief disciple interpreted the Master's words his fellows did not believe him. Then back came the Bodhisatta and from mid-air recited this stanza:--</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Who sagely meditates on sun and moon,<br> Shall win (when Reason unto Ecstasy<br> Gives place) his after-lot in Radiant Realms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</div></p>  
<p>Such was the Bodhisatta's teaching, and, first praising his disciple, he went his way back to the Brahma Realm.</p>  
<p align="center">_____________________________</p>  
<p>His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "S&#257;riputta was the chief disciple of those days, and I Mah&#257;-Brahm&#257;."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_191"></A><A HREF="#fr_192">292:1</A> These technical lines imply that, by taking the Sun and Moon as his <i>kamma&#7789;&#7789;h&#257;na</i>, or subject for meditation, a Buddhist, by attaining Jh&#257;na (or Insight) in the second (<i>i.e.</i> supra-rational) degree, can save himself from re-birth in a lower sphere of existence than the &#256;bhassaraloka or Radiant Realm of the corporeal Brahma-world.</P>
