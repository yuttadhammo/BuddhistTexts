<p>gathered the assembly and said, "Brethren, it is right to distrust where distrust is proper; sins surround a man as banyans and such plants grow up around a tree: in this way of old a spirit dwelling in the top of a cotton-tree saw a bird voiding the banyan seeds it had eaten among the branches of the cotton-tree, and became terrified lest her abode should thereby come to destruction:" and so he told a tale of old.</p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a tree-spirit dwelling in the top of a cotton-tree. A king of the rocs assumed a shape a hundred and fifty leagues in extent, and dividing the water in the great ocean by the blast of his wings, he seized by the tail a king of snakes a thousand fathoms long, and making the snake disgorge what he had seized in his mouth, he flew along the tree tops towards the cotton-tree. The snake-king thought, "I will make him drop me and let me go," so he stuck his hood into a banyan-tree and wound himself round it firmly. Owing to the roe-king's strength and the great size of the snake-king the banyan was uprooted. But the snake-king would not let go the banyan. The roc-king took the snake-king, banyan-tree and all, to the cotton-tree, laid him on the trunk, opened his belly [398] and ate the fat. Then he threw the rest of the carcase into the sea. Now in that banyan there was a certain bird, who flew up when the banyan was thrown away, and perched in one of the boughs high on the cotton-tree. The tree-spirit seeing the bird shook and trembled with fear, thinking, "This bird will let its droppings fall on my trunk; a growth of banyan or of fig will arise and go spreading all over my tree: so my home will be destroyed." The tree shook to the roots with the trembling of the spirit. The roc-king perceived the trembling, and spoke two stanzas in enquiry as to the reason:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">I bore with me the thousand fathoms length of that king-snake:<br> His size and my huge bulk you bore and yet you did not quake.</p>  
<p>But now this tiny bird you bear, so small compared to me:<br> You shake with fear and tremble; but wherefore, cotton-tree?</div></small></p>  
<p>Then the deity spoke four stanzas in explanation of the reason:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Flesh is thy food, O king: the bird's is fruit:<br> Seeds of the banyan and the fig he'll shoot<br> And bo-tree too, and all my trunk pollute;</p>  
<p>They will grow trees in shelter of my stem,<br> And I shall be no tree, thus hid by them.</div></small></p>  
<p>[399] <small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Other trees, once strong of root and rich in branches, plainly show<br> How the seeds that birds do carry in destruction lay them low.</p>  
<p>Parasitic growths will bury e&#8217;en the mighty forest tree:<br> This is why, O king, I quiver when the fear to come I see.</div></small></p>  
<p><a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="green">p. 241</font></A></p>  
<p>Hearing the tree-spirit's words, the roc-king spoke the final stanza:&#8212;</p>  
<p><small><div style="margin-left: 32px">Fear is right if things are fearful: &#8217;gainst the coming danger guard:<br> Wise men look on both worlds calmly if they present fears discard.</div></small></p>  
<p>So speaking, the roc-king by his power drove the bird away from that tree.</p>  
<p><hr width="50%"></p>  
<p>After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths, beginning with the words: "It is right to distrust where distrust is proper," and identified the Birth:&#8212;after the Truths [400] five hundred Brethren were established in Sainthood:&#8212;"At that time S&#257;riputta was the roc-king and I myself the tree-spirit."</p>
