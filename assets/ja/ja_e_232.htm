<p>"Who masters quite each rule and rite; who others' weakness knows;<br> Like wise owls, he will happy be, and conquer all his foes."</small></div></p>  
<p>[209] When the king heard this, he turned back home again.</p>

<p>This discourse ended, the Master identified the Birth:--"&#256;nanda was then the king, and the wise courtier was I myself."</p>
