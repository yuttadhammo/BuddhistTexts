Extinction will I seek to find,<BR>

</P>

<P><A NAME="page_9_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_9_fr_1">1</A> Native gloss: J&acirc;taka, vol. i., p. 7, l. 14: <I>Exempted from the five defects</I>: The following are the five defects in a walking-place: hardness and unevenness; trees in the midst; dense underbrush; excessive narrowness; excessive width. For if the walking-place be on hard and uneven ground, then any one who uses it hurts and blisters his feet, so that he fails of concentration of mind, and his meditation is broken up; while he who walks at ease on a soft and even surface succeeds in meditation. Therefore hardness and unevenness of surface are to be reckoned as one defect. If a walking-place have trees in it, whether in the middle or at the end, then any one who uses it is liable, if not careful, to strike his forehead or his head against them. Therefore trees in the midst are a second defect. If a walking-place be overgrown with a dense underbrush of grass, vines, and so forth, any one who uses it in the dark is liable to tread upon snakes and other creatures and kill them, or they may bite and injure him. Thus a dense underbrush is a third defect. If a walking-place be excessively narrow, say only a cubit or half a cubit wide, then any one who uses it is liable to stumble at the borders and stub his toes and break his toe-nails. Therefore excessive narrowness is a fourth defect. If a walking-place be excessively wide, then any one who uses it is liable to have his mind wander and fail of concentration. Thus excessive width is a fifth defect. A walking-place should be a path a cubit and a half in breadth, with a margin of a cubit on either side, and it should be sixty cubits in length, and it should have a surface soft and evenly sprinkled with sand.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_9_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_9_fr_2">2</A> Ibidem, l. 30. <I>And having all the virtues eight</I>: Having the eight advantages for a monk. The following are the eight advantages for a monk: it admits of no storing-up of treasure or grain; it favors only a blameless alms-seeking; there one can eat his alms in peace and quiet; there no annoyance is experienced from the reigning families when they oppress the kingdom with their levies of the precious metals or of leaden money; no passionate desire arises for furniture and implements; there is no fear of being plundered by robbers; no intimacies are formed with kings and courtiers; and one is not shut in in any of the four directions.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_9_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_9_fr_3">3</A> Native gloss: J&acirc;taka, vol. i., p. 8, l. 27: <I>For cloaks possess the nine defects</I>: . . . For one who retires from the world and takes up the life of an anchorite, there are nine defects inherent in garments of cloth. The great cost is one defect; the fact that it is got by dependence on others is another; the fact that it is easily soiled by use is another, for when it has been soiled it must be washed and dyed; the fact that when it is much worn it must needs be patched and mended is another; the difficulty of obtaining a new one when needed is another; its unsuitableness for an anchorite who has retired from the world is another; its acceptableness to one's enemies is another, for it must needs be guarded lest the enemy take it; the danger that it may be worn for ornament is another; the temptation it affords to load one's self down with it in travelling is another.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_10_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_10_fr_1">1</A> The bast, or inner bark of certain trees, was much used in India as cloth, to which indeed it bears a striking resemblance.--Native gloss: J&acirc;taka, vol. i., p. 9, l. 2: <I>Which is with virtues twelve endued</I>: Possessing twelve advantages. For there are twelve advantages in a dress of bark. It is cheap, good, and suitable; this is one advantage. You can make it yourself; this is a second. It gets dirty but slowly by use, and hence time is not wasted in washing it; this is a third. It never needs sewing, even when much used and worn; this is a fourth. But when a new one is needed, it can be made with ease; this is a fifth. Its suitableness for an anchorite who has retired from the world is a sixth. That it is of no use to one's enemies is a seventh. That it cannot be worn for ornament is an eighth. Its lightness is a ninth. Its conducing to moderation in dress is a tenth. The irreproachableness and blamelessness of searching for bark is an eleventh. And the unimportance of its loss is a twelfth.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_10_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_10_fr_2">2</A> Native gloss: J&acirc;taka, vol. i., p. 9, l.11: <I>My hut of leaves I then forsook, So crowded with the eight defects</I>: ...(L. 36) For there are eight evils connected with the use of a leaf-hut. The great labor involved in searching for materials and in the putting of them together is one evil. The constant care necessary to replace the grass, leaves, and bits of clay that fall down is a second. Houses may do for old men, but no concentration of mind is possible when one's meditation is liable to be interrupted; thus the liability to interruption is a third. The protection afforded against heat and cold renders the body delicate, and this is a fourth. In a house all sorts of evil deeds are possible; thus the cover it affords for disgraceful practices is a fifth. The taking possession, saying, "This is mine," is a sixth. To have a house is like having a companion; this is a seventh. And the sharing of it with many others, as for instance with lice, bugs, and house-lizards, is an eighth.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_10_note_3"></A><A HREF="#page_10_fr_3">3</A> Ibidem, p. 10, l. 9: <I>And at the foot of trees I lived, For such abodes have virtues ten</I>: ...The following are the ten virtues. The smallness of the undertaking is one virtue, for all that is necessary is simply to go to the tree. The small amount of care it requires is a second; for, whether swept or unswept, it is suitable for use. The freedom from interruption is a third. It affords no cover for disgraceful practices; wickedness there would be too public; thus the fact that it affords no cover for disgraceful practices is a fourth. It is like living under the open sky, for there is no feeling that the body is confined; thus the nonconfinement of the body is a fifth. There is no taking possession; this is a sixth. The abandonment of all longings for household life is a seventh. When a house is shared with others, some one is liable to say,"I will look after this house myself. Begone!" Thus the freedom from eviction is an eighth. The happy contentment experienced by the occupant is a ninth. The little concern one need feel about lodgings, seeing that a man can find a tree no matter where he may be stopping,--this is a tenth.</P>

What now if I, like D&icirc;pamkara, were to acquire the supreme wisdom, were to cause multitudes to go on board the ship of Doctrine and cross the ocean of the round of rebirth, and were afterwards to pass into Nirvana! That would be something worthy of me!"</P>

<P><A NAME="page_14_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_14_fr_2">2</A> Native gloss: J&acirc;taka, vol. i., p. 14, l. 20: For it is only a human being that can successfully wish to be a Buddha; a serpent, or a bird, or a deity cannot successfully make the wish. Of human beings it is only one of the male sex that can make the wish: it would not be successful on the part of a woman, or of a eunuch, or of a neuter, or of a hermaphrodite. Of men it is he, and only he, who is in a fit condition by the attainment of saintship in that same existence, that can successfully make the wish. Of those in a fit condition it is only he who makes the wish in the presence of a living Buddha that succeeds in his wish; after the death of a Buddha a wish made at a relic-shrine, or at the foot of a Bo-tree, will not be successful. Of those who make the wish in the presence of a Buddha it is he, and only he, who has retired from the world that can successfully make the wish, and not one who is a layman. Of those who have retired from the world it is only he who is possessed of the Five High Powers and is master of the Eight Attainments that can successfully make the wish, and no one can do so who is lacking in these excellences. Of those, even, who possess these excellences it is he, and only he, who has such firm resolve that he is ready to sacrifice his life for The Buddhas that can successfully make the wish, but no other. Of those who possess this resolve it is he, and only he, who has great zeal, determination, strenuousness, and endeavor in striving for the qualities that make a Buddha that is successful. The following comparisons will show the intensity of the zeal. If he is such a one as to think: "The man who, if all within the rim of the world were to become water, would be ready to swim across it with his own arms and get to the further shore,--he is the one to attain the Buddhaship; or, in case all within the rim of the world were to become a jungle of bamboo, would be ready to elbow and trample his way through it and get to the further side,--he is the one to attain the Buddhaship; or, in case all within the rim of the world were to become a terra firma of thick-set javelins, would be ready to tread on them and go afoot to the further side,--he is the one to attain the Buddhaship; or, in case all within the rim of the world were to become live coals, would be ready to tread on them and so get to the further side,--he is the one to attain the Buddhaship,"--if he deems not even one of these feats too hard for himself, but has such great zeal, determination, strenuousness, and power of endeavor that he would perform these feats in order to attain the Buddhaship, then, but not otherwise, will his wish succeed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in accomplishing these Ten Perfections there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of almsgiving; as when he was born as the Brahman Akitti, the Brahman Samkha, king Dhana&ntilde;jaya, Mah&acirc;-Sudassana, Mah&acirc;-Govinda, king Nimi, prince Canda, Visayha the treasurer, king Sivi, and king Vessantara. But the acme was reached when as the Wise Hare<A NAME="page_35_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_35_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> he said,--</P>

Myself I gave that he might eat.<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>Thus, in this offering up of his own life, he acquired the perfection of almsgiving in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the precepts; as when he was born as the elephant-king S&icirc;lava, the snake-king Campeyya, the snake-king Bh&ucirc;ridatta, the elephant-king Chaddanta, and prince Al&icirc;nasattu, son of king Jayaddisa. But the acme was reached when, as related in the Samkhap&acirc;la Birth-Story, he said,--</P>

<P>Thus, in giving up his own life, he acquired perfection in the keeping of the precepts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of abnegation by abandoning</P>

Like spittle vile I let it fall,<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>Thus, free from attachment, he renounced a kingdom and retired from the world, and by so doing acquired the perfection of abnegation in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of knowledge; as when he was born as the pandit Vidh&ucirc;ra, the pandit Mah&acirc;-Govinda, the pandit Kudd&acirc;la, the pandit Araka, the wandering ascetic Bodhi, and the pandit Mahosadha. But the acme was reached when, as the pandit Senaka of the Sattubhatta Birth-Story, he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>262. </TD><TD>"With wisdom sifted I the case,<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>and displayed to all present the serpent which lay concealed in the bag, and in so doing acquired the perfection of wisdom in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise there was no limit to the number of existences in which he fulfilled the perfection of courage. But the acme was reached when, as related in the Greater Janaka Birth-Story, he said,--</P>

<P>in enduring great suffering, while appearing to be unconscious, he acquired the perfection of patience in its highest degree.</P>

<P>in keeping his word at the sacrifice of his life, he acquired the perfection of truth in its highest degree.</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>266. </TD><TD>"'T is not that I my parents hate,<BR>
'T is not that glory I detest,<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>in resolving on a course of conduct that cost him his life, he acquired the perfection of resolution in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise in the Ekar&acirc;ja Birth-Story, where he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>267. </TD><TD>"No fear has any one of me,<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>in the exercise of feelings of good-will, and in taking no thought for his life, he acquired the perfection of good-will in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise in the Lomahamsa Birth-Story, where he said,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>268. </TD><TD>"I laid me down among the dead,<BR>
A pillow of their bones I made;<BR>
While from the villages around,<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>while village children flocked about him, and some spat and others showered fragrant garlands upon him, he was indifferent alike to pleasure and pain, and acquired the perfection of indifference in its highest degree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is an abridgment, but the full account is given in the Cariy&acirc;-Pitaka.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having thus fulfilled all the perfections, he said, in his existence as Vessantara,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>269. </TD><TD>"This earth, unconscious though she be,<BR>
And ignorant of joy or grief,<BR>
E'en she then felt alms' mighty power,<BR>
And shook and quaked full seven times."<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>And having thus caused the earth to quake by his mighty deeds of merit, at the end of that existence he died, and was reborn in the Tusita heaven.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly the period from the time when he fell at the feet of D&icirc;pamkara to his birth in the city of the Tusita gods constitutes the Distant Epoch.</P>

The stanza quoted, however, is not taken from that account, but from another work called the Cariy&acirc;-Pitaka, which is wholly in poetry. The Cariy&acirc;-Pitaka consists of Birth-Stories, and besides the Wise Hare, gives several others of those here mentioned. Some are also briefly alluded to in the ninth chapter of the Visuddhi-Magga; but of course the great treasure-house for Birth-Stories is the J&acirc;taka itself.</P>
