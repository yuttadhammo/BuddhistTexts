<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while the Future Buddha was still dwelling in the city of the Tusita gods, the "Buddha-Uproar," as it is called, took place. For there are three uproars which take place in the world,--the Cyclic-Uproar, the Buddha-Uproar, and the Universal-Monarch-Uproar. They occur as follows:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is known that after the lapse of a hundred thousand years the cycle is to be renewed, the gods called Loka-by&ucirc;has, inhabitants of a heaven of sensual pleasure, wander about through the world, with hair let down and flying in the wind, weeping and wiping away their tears with their hands, and with their clothes red and in great disorder. And thus they make announcement:--</P>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sirs, after the lapse of a hundred thousand years, the cycle is to be renewed; this world will be destroyed; also the mighty ocean will dry up; and this broad earth, and Sineru, the monarch of the mountains, will be burnt up and destroyed,--up to the Brahma heavens will the destruction of the world extend. Therefore, sirs, cultivate friendliness; cultivate compassion, joy, and indifference; wait on your mothers; wait on your fathers; and honor your elders among your kinsfolk."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called the Cyclic-Uproar.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, when it is known that after a lapse of a thousand years an omniscient Buddha is to arise in the world, the guardian angels of the world wander about, proclaiming:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sirs, after the lapse of a thousand years a Buddha will arise in the world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called the Buddha-Uproar.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lastly, when they realize that after the lapse of a hundred years a Universal Monarch is to arise, the terrestrial deities wander about, proclaiming:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sirs, after the lapse of a hundred years a Universal Monarch is to arise in the world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called the Universal-Monarch-Uproar. And these three are mighty uproars.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When of these three Uproars they hear the sound of the Buddha-Uproar, the gods of all ten thousand worlds come together into one place, and having ascertained what particular being is to be The Buddha, they approach him, and beseech him to become one. But it is not till after omens have appeared that they beseech him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, therefore, having all come together in one world, with the Cat&ucirc;m-Mah&acirc;r&acirc;jas, and with the Sakka, the Suy&acirc;ma, the Santusita, the Paranimmita-Vasavatti, and the Mah&acirc;-Brahma of each several world, they approached the Future Buddha in the Tusita heaven, and besought him, saying,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, it was not to acquire the glory of a Sakka, or of a M&acirc;ra, or of a Brahma, or of a Universal Monarch, that you fulfilled the Ten Perfections; but it was to gain omniscience</P>

</TABLE>

<P>in order to save the world, that you fulfilled them. Sir, the time and fit season for your Buddhaship has now arrived."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Great Being, before assenting to their wish, made what is called the five great observations. He observed, namely, the time, the continent, the country, the family, and the mother and her span of life.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first of these observations he asked himself whether it was the right time or no. Now it is not the right time when the length of men's lives is more than a hundred thousand years. And why is it not the right time? Because mortals then forget about birth, old age, and death. And if The Buddhas, who always include in their teachings the Three Characteristics, were to attempt at such a time to discourse concerning transitoriness, misery, and the lack of substantive reality, men would not think it worth while listening to them, nor would they give them credence. Thus there would be no conversions made; and if there were no conversions, the dispensation would not conduce to salvation. This, therefore, is not the right time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also it is not the right time when men's lives are less than a hundred years. And why is it not the right time? Because mortals are then exceedingly corrupt; and an exhortation given to the exceedingly corrupt makes no impression, but, like a mark drawn with a stick on the surface of the water, it immediately disappears. This, therefore, also is not the right time.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the length of men's lives is between a hundred years and a hundred thousand years, then is it the right time. Now at that time men's lives were a hundred years; accordingly the Great Being observed that it was the right time for his birth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next he made the observation concerning the continent. Looking over the four continents with their attendant isles, he reflected: "In three of the continents the Buddhas are never born; only in the continent of India are they born." Thus he decided on the continent.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next he made the observation concerning the place. "The continent of India is large," thought he, "being ten</P>

</TABLE>

<P>thousand leagues around. In which of its countries are The Buddhas born?" Thus he decided on the Middle Country.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Middle Country is the country defined in the Vinaya as follows:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It lies in the middle, on this side of the town Kaja&ntilde;gala on the east, beyond which is Mah&acirc;-S&acirc;la, and beyond that the border districts. It lies in the middle, on this side of the river Salalavat&icirc; on the southeast, beyond which are the border districts. It lies in the middle, on this side of the town Setakannika on the south, beyond which are the border districts. It lies in the middle, on this side of the Brahmanical town Th&ucirc;na on the west, beyond which are the border districts. It lies in the middle, on this side of the hill Us&icirc;raddhaja on the north, beyond which are the border districts."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is three hundred leagues in length, two hundred and fifty in breadth, and nine hundred in circumference. In this country are born The Buddhas, the Private Buddhas,<A NAME="page_41_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_41_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> the Chief Disciples, the Eighty Great Disciples, the Universal Monarch, and other eminent ones, magnates of the warrior caste, of the Brahman caste, and the wealthy householders. "And in it is this city called Kapilavatthu," thought he, and concluded that there he ought to be born.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he made the observation concerning the family. "The Buddhas," thought he, "are never born into a family of the peasant caste, or of the servile caste; but into one of the warrior caste, or of the Brahman caste, whichever at the time is the higher in public estimation. The warrior caste is now the higher in public estimation. I will be born into a warrior family, and king Suddhodana shall be my father." Thus he decided on the family.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he made the observation concerning the mother. "The mother of a Buddha," thought he, "is never a wanton, nor a drunkard, but is one who has fulfilled the perfections through a hundred thousand cycles, and has kept the five precepts unbroken from the day of her birth. Now this queen Mah&acirc;-M&acirc;y&acirc; is such a one; and she shall be my mother."--</P>

<P>"But what shall be her span of life?"<A NAME="page_42_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_42_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> continued he. And he perceived that it was to be ten months and seven days.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having thus made the five great observations, he kindly made the gods the required promise, saying,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sirs, you are right. The time has come for my Buddhaship."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, surrounded by the gods of the Tusita heaven, and dismissing all the other gods, he entered the Nandana Grove of the Tusita capital,--for in each of the heavens there is a Nandana Grove. And here the gods said, "Attain in your next existence your high destiny," and kept reminding him that he had already paved the way to it by his accumulated merit. Now it was while he was thus dwelling, surrounded by these deities, and continually reminded of his accumulated merit, that he died, and was conceived in the womb of queen Mah&acirc;-M&acirc;y&acirc;. And in order that this matter may be fully understood, I will give the whole account in due order.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is related that at that time the Midsummer Festival had been proclaimed in the city of Kapilavatthu, and the multitude were enjoying the feast. And queen Mah&acirc;-M&acirc;y&acirc;, abstaining from strong drink, and brilliant with garlands and perfumes, took part in the festivities for the six days previous to the day of full moon. And when it came to be the day of full moon, she rose early, bathed in perfumed water, and dispensed four hundred thousand pieces of money in great largess. And decked in full gala attire, she ate of the choicest food; after which she took the eight vows, and entered her elegantly furnished chamber of state. And lying down on the royal couch, she fell asleep and dreamed the following dream:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four guardian angels came and lifted her up, together with her couch, and took her away to the Himalaya Mountains. There, in the Manosil&acirc; table-land, which is sixty leagues in extent, they laid her under a prodigious sal-tree,</P>

<!--------------------------p. 43-------------------------->

<TABLE WIDTH="100%">
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD ALIGN="left"><A NAME="page_43"><FONT COLOR=GREEN SIZE=1>p. 43</FONT></A></TD>

</TABLE>

<P>seven leagues in height, and took up their positions respectfully at one side. Then came the wives of these guardian angels, and conducted her to Anotatta Lake, and bathed her, to remove every human stain. And after clothing her with divine garments, they anointed her with perfumes and decked her with divine flowers. Not far off was Silver Hill, and in it a golden mansion. There they spread a divine couch with its head towards the east, and laid her down upon it. Now the Future Buddha had become a superb white elephant, and was wandering about at no great distance, on Gold Hill. Descending thence, he ascended Silver Hill, and approaching from the north, he plucked a white lotus with his silvery trunk, and trumpeting loudly, went into the golden mansion. And three times he walked round his mother's couch, with his right side towards it, and striking her on her right side, he seemed to enter her womb. Thus the conception took place in the Midsummer Festival.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next day the queen awoke, and told the dream to the king. And the king caused sixty-four eminent Brahmans to be summoned, and spread costly seats for them on ground festively prepared with green leaves, Dalbergia flowers, and so forth. The Brahmans being seated, he filled gold and silver dishes with the best of milk-porridge compounded with ghee, honey, and treacle; and covering these dishes with others, made likewise of gold and silver, he gave the Brahmans to eat. And not only with food, but with other gifts, such as new garments, tawny cows, and so forth, he satisfied them completely. And when their every desire had been satisfied, he told them the dream and asked them what would come of it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be not anxious, great king!" said the Brahmans; "a child has planted itself in the womb of your queen, and it is a male child and not a female. You will have a son. And he, if he continue to live the household life, will become a Universal Monarch; but if he leave the household life and retire from the world, he will become a Buddha, and roll back the clouds of sin and folly of this world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the instant the Future Buddha was conceived in the</P>

<P>womb of his mother, all the ten thousand worlds suddenly quaked, quivered, and shook. And the Thirty-two Prognostics appeared, as follows: an immeasurable light spread through ten thousand worlds; the blind recovered their sight, as if from desire to see this his glory; the deaf received their hearing; the dumb talked; the hunchbacked became straight of body; the lame recovered the power to walk; all those in bonds were freed from their bonds and chains; the fires went out in all the hells; the hunger and thirst of the Manes was stilled; wild animals lost their timidity; diseases ceased among men; all mortals became mild-spoken; horses neighed and elephants trumpeted in a manner sweet to the ear; all musical instruments gave forth their notes without being played upon; bracelets and other ornaments jingled; in all quarters of the heavens the weather became fair; a mild, cool breeze began to blow, very refreshing to men; rain fell out of season; water burst forth from the earth and flowed in streams; the birds ceased flying through the air; the rivers checked their flowing; in the mighty ocean the water became sweet; the ground became everywhere covered with lotuses of the five different colors; all flowers bloomed, both those on land and those that grow in the water; trunk-lotuses bloomed on the trunks of trees, branch-lotuses on the branches, and vine-lotuses on the vines; on the ground, stalk-lotuses, as they are called, burst through the overlying rocks and came up by sevens; in the sky were produced others, called hanging-lotuses; a shower of flowers fell all about; celestial music was heard to play in the sky; and the whole ten thousand worlds became one mass of garlands of the utmost possible magnificence, with waving chowries, and saturated with the incense-like fragrance of flowers, and resembled a bouquet of flowers sent whirling through the air, or a closely woven wreath, or a superbly decorated altar of flowers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the time the Future Buddha was thus conceived, four angels with swords in their hands kept guard, to ward off all harm from both the Future Buddha and the Future Buddha's mother. No lustful thought sprang up in the mind of the Future Buddha's mother; having reached the</P>

<P>pinnacle of good fortune and of glory, she felt comfortable and well, and experienced no exhaustion of body. And within her womb she could distinguish the Future Buddha, like a white thread passed through a transparent jewel. And whereas a womb that has been occupied by a Future Buddha is like the shrine of a temple, and can never be occupied or used again, therefore it was that the mother of the Future Buddha died when he was seven days old, and was reborn in the Tusita heaven.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now other women sometimes fall short of and sometimes run over the term of ten lunar months, and then bring forth either sitting or lying down; but not so the mother of a Future Buddha. She carries the Future Buddha in her womb for just ten months, and then brings forth while standing up. This is a characteristic of the mother of a Future Buddha. So also queen Mah&acirc;-M&acirc;y&acirc; carried the Future Buddha in her womb, as it were oil in a vessel, for ten months; and being then far gone with child, she grew desirous of going home to her relatives, and said to king Suddhodana,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sire, I should like to visit my kinsfolk in their city Devadaha."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So be it," said the king; and from Kapilavatthu to the city of Devadaha he had the road made even, and garnished it with plantain-trees set in pots, and with banners, and streamers; and, seating the queen in a golden palanquin borne by a thousand of his courtiers, he sent her away in great pomp.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now between the two cities, and belonging to the inhabitants of both, there was a pleasure-grove of sal-trees, called Lumbini Grove. And at this particular time this grove was one mass of flowers from the ground to the topmost branches, while amongst the branches and flowers hummed swarms of bees of the five different colors, and flocks of various kinds of birds flew about warbling sweetly. Throughout the whole of Lumbini Grove the scene resembled the Cittalat&acirc; Grove in Indra's paradise, or the magnificently decorated banqueting pavilion of some potent king.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the queen beheld it she became desirous of disporting</P>

<!--------------------------p. 46-------------------------->

<TABLE WIDTH="100%">
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD ALIGN="left"><A NAME="page_46"><FONT COLOR=GREEN SIZE=1>p. 46</FONT></A></TD>

</TABLE>

<P>herself therein, and the courtiers therefore took her into it. And going to the foot of the monarch sal-tree of the grove, she wished to take hold of one of its branches. And the sal-tree branch, like the tip of a well-steamed reed, bent itself down within reach of the queen's hand. Then she reached out her hand, and seized hold of the branch, and immediately her pains came upon her. Thereupon the people hung a curtain about her, and retired. So her delivery took place while she was standing up, and keeping fast hold of the sal-tree branch.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that very moment came four pure-minded Mah&acirc;-Brahma angels bearing a golden net; and, receiving the Future Buddha on this golden net, they placed him before his mother and said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rejoice, O queen! A mighty son has been born to you."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now other mortals on issuing from the maternal womb are smeared with disagreeable, impure matter; but not so the Future Buddha. He issued from his mother's womb like a preacher descending from his preaching-seat, or a man coming down a stair, stretching out both hands and both feet, unsmeared by any impurity from his mother's womb, and flashing pure and spotless, like a jewel thrown upon a vesture of Benares cloth. Notwithstanding this, for the sake of honoring the Future Buddha and his mother, there came two streams of water from the sky, and refreshed the Future Buddha and his mother.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Brahma angels, after receiving him on their golden net, delivered him to the four guardian angels, who received him from their hands on a rug which was made of the skins of black antelopes, and was soft to the touch, being such as is used on state occasions; and the guardian angels delivered him to men who received him on a coil of fine cloth; and the men let him out of their hands on the ground, where he stood and faced the east. There, before him, lay many thousands of worlds, like a great open court; and in them, gods and men, making offerings to him of perfumes, garlands, and so on, were saying,--</P>

<TD ALIGN="right"><SMALL>[J.i.53<SUP>13</SUP></SMALL></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great Being! There is none your equal, much less your superior."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had in this manner surveyed the four cardinal points, and the four intermediate ones, and the zenith, and the nadir, in short, all the ten directions in order, and had nowhere discovered his equal, he exclaimed, "This is the best direction," and strode forward seven paces, followed by Mah&acirc;-Brahma holding over him the white umbrella, Suy&acirc;ma bearing the fan, and other divinities having the other symbols of royalty in their hands. Then, at the seventh stride, he halted, and with a noble voice, he shouted the shout of victory, beginning,--</P>

<P ALIGN="center">"The Chief am I in all the world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in three of his existences did the Future Buddha utter words immediately on issuing from his mother's womb: namely, in his existence as Mahosadha; in his existence as Vessantara; and in this existence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As respects his existence as Mahosadha, it is related that just as he was issuing from his mother's womb, Sakka, the king of the gods, came and placed in his hand some choice sandal-wood, and departed. And he closed his fist upon it, and issued forth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child," said his mother, "what is it you bring with you in your hand?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Medicine, mother," said he.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, as he was born with medicine in his hand, they gave him the name of Osadha-D&acirc;raka [Medicine-Child]. Then they took the medicine, and placed it in an earthenware jar; and it was a sovereign remedy to heal all the blind, the deaf, and other afflicted persons who came to it. So the saying sprang up, "This is a great medicine, this is a great medicine!" And thus he received the name of Mahosadha [Great Medicine-Man].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in the Vessantara existence, as he was issuing from his mother's womb, he stretched out his right hand, and said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray, mother, is there anything in the house? I want to give alms."</P>

<!--------------------------p. 48-------------------------->

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, after he had completely issued forth, his mother said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a wealthy family, my son, into which you are born;" and putting his hand in her own, she had them place in his a purse containing a thousand pieces of money.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, in this birth he shouted the shout of victory above-mentioned.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus in three of his existences did the Future Buddha utter words immediately on issuing from his mother's womb. And just as at the moment of his conception, so also at the moment of his birth appeared the Thirty-two Prognostics.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at the very time that our Future Buddha was born in Lumbini Grove there also came into existence the mother of R&acirc;hula, and Channa the courtier, K&acirc;lud&acirc;yi the courtier, Kanthaka the king of horses, the Great Bo-tree, and the four urns full of treasure. Of these last, one was a quarter of a league in extent, another a half-league, the third three quarters of a league, and the fourth a league. These seven<A NAME="page_48_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_48_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> are called the Connate Ones.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the inhabitants of both cities took the Future Buddha, and carried him to Kapilavatthu.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O<SMALL>N</SMALL> this same day the happy and delighted hosts of the Heaven of the Thirty-three held a celebration, waving their cloaks and giving other signs of joy, because to king Suddhodana in Kapilavatthu had been born a son who should sit at the foot of the Bo-tree, and become a Buddha.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it came to pass at that time that an ascetic named K&acirc;ladevala, who was an intimate friend of king Suddhodana, and practised in the eight stages of meditation, went, after</P>

<P>his daily meal, to the Heaven of the Thirty-three to take his noon-day rest. And as he was sitting there resting, he noticed these gods, and said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you frolic so joyously? Let me too know the reason."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir," replied the gods, "it is because a son has been born to king Suddhodana, who shall sit at the foot of the Bo-tree, and become a Buddha, and cause the Wheel of the Doctrine to roll; in him we shall be permitted to behold the infinite and masterful ease of a Buddha, and shall hear the Doctrine."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing this, the ascetic descended from the world of the gods in haste, and entered the dwelling of the king; and having seated himself on the seat assigned to him, he said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great king, I hear that a son has been born to you. I would see him."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the king had the prince magnificently dressed, and brought in, and carried up to do reverence to the ascetic. But the feet of the Future Buddha turned and planted themselves in the matted locks of the ascetic. For in that birth there was no one worthy of the Future Buddha's reverence; and if these ignorant people had succeeded in causing the Future Buddha to bow, the head of the ascetic would have split in seven pieces.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not meet that I compass my own death," thought the ascetic, and rose from his seat, and with joined hands did reverence to the Future Buddha. And when the king had seen this wonder, he also did reverence to his son. Now the ascetic could look backward into the past for forty world-cycles, and forward into the future for forty world-cycles,--in all, eighty world-cycles. And, noting on the person of the Future Buddha all the lucky marks and characteristics, he began to reflect and consider whether or not they prophesied his Buddhaship. And perceiving that undoubtedly he would become a Buddha, he thought to himself, "What a marvellous personage he is!" and smiled.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next he considered in his mind whether he would live to see him attain the Buddhaship; and he perceived that he was</P>

<P>not to have that opportunity. For he would die before that time, and be reborn in the formless mode of existence, where it would be out of the power of even a hundred or a thousand Buddhas to come and enlighten him. And he thought, "It will not be mine to behold this so marvellous a personage when he has become a Buddha. My loss, alas, will be great," and wept.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people noticed his behavior, and said to him,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our good father smiled but a moment ago, and now has begun to weep. Reverend sir, is any misfortune to happen to our young master?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No misfortune is to happen to him. He will become a Buddha without any manner of doubt."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then why did you weep?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wept at the thought of my own great loss; for, alas, I am not to have an opportunity of seeing this marvellous person after he has become a Buddha."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next he considered in his mind whether or not any of his relatives were to have the opportunity; and he saw that his sister's child N&acirc;laka was to have it. And he went to his sister's house, and inquired,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is your son N&acirc;laka?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good father, he is in the house."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call him hither."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child," said he to the lad when he had come, "a son has been born in the family of Suddhodana the king, who is the coming Buddha. Thirty-five years from now he will become a Buddha, and you will have an opportunity of seeing him. Retire from the world this very day."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the child did so, although he belonged to a family possessing eight hundred and seventy millions of treasure; for he thought, "My uncle would not lay such a command upon me for any trifling reason." Sending to the bazaar, he procured some yellow garments, and an earthenware bowl, and cut off his hair and his beard, and put on the yellow garments. And stretching out his joined hands in the direction of the Future Buddha, he said, "I retire from the world to follow earth's greatest being." Then he prostrated himself,</P>

<P>so that he touched the ground with the fivefold contact. Having thus done reverence, he placed the bowl in his scrip, slung the latter over his shoulder, and going to the Himalaya Mountains, he there performed the duties of a monk.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after the Great Being had achieved the absolute and supreme wisdom, N&acirc;laka came to him, and had him prescribe the N&acirc;laka course of conduct.<A NAME="page_51_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_51_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> Then, returning to the Himalaya Mountains, he attained to saintship, and adopted that excellent course. And keeping alive for seven months more, and being at the time near a certain Gold Hill, he passed out of existence by that final extinction in which none of the elements of being remain.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the fifth day they bathed the Future Buddha's head, saying, "We will perform the rite of choosing a name for him." And they prepared the royal palace by anointing it with four kinds of perfumes, and by scattering Dalbergia blossoms and other flowers, five sorts in all. And making some porridge of whole rice-grains boiled in milk, they invited one hundred and eight Brahmans, men who had mastered the three Vedas. And having seated these Brahmans in the royal palace, and fed them with delicate food, and showed them every attention, they asked them to observe the marks and characteristics of the Future Buddha's person, and to prophesy his fortune.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the hundred and eight,--</P>

<P>conception. Seven of these raised two fingers each, and gave a double interpretation, saying, "If a man possessing such marks and characteristics continue in the household life, he becomes a Universal Monarch; if he retire from the world, he becomes a Buddha." And then they set forth all the glory of a Universal Monarch.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the youngest of them all, a youth whose clan-name was Konda&ntilde;&ntilde;a, after examining the splendid set of marks and characteristics on the person of the Future Buddha, raised only one finger, and gave but a single interpretation, saying, "There is here naught to make him stay in the household life. He will most undoubtedly become a Buddha, and remove the veil of ignorance and folly from the world." For this Konda&ntilde;&ntilde;a was one who had made an earnest wish under former Buddhas, and was now in his last existence. Therefore it was that he outstripped the other seven in knowledge, and saw but one future; inasmuch as a person possessed of such marks and characteristics would never stay in the household life, but would undoubtedly become a Buddha. So he raised only one finger, and gave that interpretation.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the seven Brahmans went home and said to their sons, "Children, we are old, but whether we ourselves are alive or not when the son of Suddhodana the king shall attain omniscience, you, at least, should then retire from the world under his dispensation."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after these seven persons had lived out their term of life they passed away according to their deeds; but Konda&ntilde;&ntilde;a, being younger, was still alive and hale. And when the Great Being, after making the great retirement in pursuit of wisdom, had arrived at Uruvel&acirc; in his progress from place to place, he thought: "How pleasant indeed is this spot! How suitable for the struggles of a young man desirous of struggling!" and took up his abode there. Konda&ntilde;&ntilde;a heard the news that the Great Being had retired from the world, and drawing near to the sons of those seven Brahmans, he spoke to them as follows:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hear that prince Siddhattha has retired from the world. Now he will unquestionably become a Buddha, and if your</P>

<P>fathers were alive they would follow after him this very day. If you also would like to retire from the world, come with me. I mean to follow after that man in his retirement from the world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they could not all agree; and three of them did not retire from the world. But the remaining four did so, and made the Brahman Konda&ntilde;&ntilde;a their chief. And these five persons became known as the "Band of Five Elders."</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the king, "What shall my son see to make him retire from the world?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The four signs."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What four?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A decrepit old man, a diseased man, a dead man, and a monk."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From this time forth," said the king, "let no such persons be allowed to come near my son. It will never do for my son to become a Buddha. What I would wish to see is my son exercising sovereign rule and authority over the four great continents and the two thousand attendant isles, and walking through the heavens surrounded by a retinue thirty-six leagues in circumference." And when he had so spoken he placed guards for a distance of a quarter of a league in each of the four directions, in order that none of these four kinds of men might come within sight of his son.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this same day, also, eighty thousand clansmen assembled together in the festival-hall, and each dedicated a son, saying,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether the young prince become a Buddha or a king, we will each one give a son: so that if he become a Buddha, he shall be followed and surrounded by monks of the warrior caste; and if he become a king, by nobles of the warrior caste."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the king procured nurses for the Future Buddha,--women of fine figure, and free from all blemish. And so the Future Buddha began to grow, surrounded by an immense retinue, and in great splendor.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on a certain day the king celebrated the Sowing</P>

<P>Festival, as it was called. On that day they used to decorate the whole city, so that it looked like a palace of the gods; and all the slaves and other servants would put on new tunics; and, perfumed and garlanded, they would assemble together at the king's palace, where a thousand plows were yoked for the royal plowing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this occasion there were one hundred and eight plows, all save one ornamented with silver, as were also the reins for the oxen and the cross-bars of the plows. But the plow that was held by the king was ornamented with red gold, as also the horns, the reins, and the goads for the oxen. And the king issued forth with a large retinue, taking his son along with him. And in the field where the plowing was to be done was a solitary rose-apple tree of thick foliage and dense shade. Underneath this tree the king had a couch placed for the young prince, and spread over his head a canopy that was studded with gold stars; and he surrounded him with a screen, and appointed those that should watch by him; and then, decked with all his ornaments and surrounded by his courtiers, he proceeded to the place where they were to plow. On arriving there, the king took the gold plow, and the courtiers took the silver plows,--one hundred and eight save one, and the farmers the other plows; and then all plowed forward and back. The king went from the hither side to the farther side, and from the farther side back again; and the pomp and magnificence of the festival was at its climax.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the nurses who were sitting about the Future Buddha came out from behind the screen to behold the royal magnificence. And the Future Buddha, looking hither and thither and seeing no one, arose in haste and sat him down cross-legged, and mastering his inspirations and his expirations, entered on the first trance. The nurses delayed a little, being detained by the abundance of good things to eat. And the shadows of the other trees passed over to the east, but the shadow of the rose-apple tree remained steadily circular. Suddenly the nurses remembered that they had left their young master alone; and</P>

<P>raising the screen, they entered and saw the Future Buddha sitting cross-legged on the couch, and also noticed the miracle of the shadow. Then they went and announced to the king,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sire, thus and so is the prince sitting; and the shadows of the other trees have passed over to the east, but the shadow of the rose-apple tree remains steadily circular."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the king came in haste, and seeing the miracle, he did obeisance to his son, saying, "This, dear child, is my second obeisance."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, in due course, the Future Buddha attained to the age of sixteen years. And the king built three palaces for the Future Buddha, suited to the three seasons,--one of nine stories, another of seven stories, and another of five stories. And he provided him with forty thousand dancing girls. And the Future Buddha, with his gayly dressed dancers, was like a god surrounded by hosts of houris; and attended by musical instruments that sounded of themselves, and in the enjoyment of great magnificence, he lived, as the seasons changed, in each of these three palaces. And the mother of R&acirc;hula was his principal queen.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while he was thus enjoying great splendor, one day there arose the following discussion among his relatives:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siddhattha is wholly given over to pleasure, and is not training himself in any manly art. What could he do if war were to occur? "</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king sent for the Future Buddha, and said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child, your relatives are saying that you are not training yourself, but are wholly given over to pleasure. Now what do you think we had best do?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sire, I do not need to train myself. Let the crier go about the city beating the drum, to announce that I will show my proficiency. On the seventh day from now I will show my proficiency to my relatives."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king did so. And the Future Buddha assembled together bowmen that could shoot like lightning and at a hair's-breadth; and in the midst of the populace, and before his</P>

<P>kinsfolk, he exhibited a twelvefold skill, such as none of the other bowmen could equal. All of which is to be understood after the manner related in the Sarabha&ntilde;ga Birth-Story. So the assembly of his kinsfolk doubted him no longer.</P>

<H4><P ALIGN="center">&sect; 6. THE GREAT RETIREMENT.</P></H4>

<P ALIGN="center"><SMALL>Translated from the Introduction to the J&acirc;taka (i.58<SUP>81</SUP>).</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N<SMALL>OW</SMALL> on a certain day the Future Buddha wished to go to the park, and told his charioteer to make ready the chariot. Accordingly the man brought out a sumptuous and elegant chariot, and adorning it richly, he harnessed to it four state-horses of the Sindhava breed, as white as the petals of the white lotus, and announced to the Future Buddha that everything was ready. And the Future Buddha mounted the chariot, which was like to a palace of the gods, and proceeded towards the park.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time for the enlightenment of prince Siddhattha draweth nigh," thought the gods; "we must show him a sign:" and they changed one of their number into a decrepit old man, broken-toothed, gray-haired, crooked and bent of body, leaning on a staff, and trembling, and showed him to the Future Buddha, but so that only he and the charioteer saw him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the Future Buddha to the charioteer, in the manner related in the Mah&acirc;pad&acirc;na,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friend, pray, who is this man? Even his hair is not like that of other men." And when he heard the answer, he said, "Shame on birth, since to every one that is born old age must come." And agitated in heart, he thereupon returned and ascended his palace.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why has my son returned so quickly?" asked the king.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sire, he has seen an old man," was the reply; "and</P>

<P>because he has seen an old man, he is about to retire from the world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to kill me, that you say such things? Quickly get ready some plays to be performed before my son. If we can but get him to enjoying pleasure, he will cease to think of retiring from the world." Then the king extended the guard to half a league in each direction.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, on a certain day, as the Future Buddha was going to the park, he saw a diseased man whom the gods had fashioned; and having again made inquiry, he returned, agitated in heart, and ascended his palace.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the king made the same inquiry and gave the same orders as before; and again extending the guard, placed them for three quarters of a league around.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again on a certain day, as the Future Buddha was going to the park, he saw a dead man whom the gods had fashioned; and having again made inquiry, he returned, agitated in heart, and ascended his palace.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the king made the same inquiry and gave the same orders as before; and again extending the guard, placed them for a league around.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again on a certain day, as the Future Buddha was going to the park, he saw a monk, carefully and decently clad, whom the gods had fashioned; and he asked his charioteer, "Pray, who is this man?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now although there was no Buddha in the world, and the charioteer had no knowledge of either monks or their good qualities, yet by the power of the gods he was inspired to say, "Sire, this is one who has retired from the world;" and he thereupon proceeded to sound the praises of retirement from the world. The thought of retiring from the world was a pleasing one to the Future Buddha, and this day he went on until he came to the park. The repeaters of the D&icirc;gha,<A NAME="page_57_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_57_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> however, say that he went to the park after having seen all the Four Signs on one and the same day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had disported himself there throughout the day,</P>

<P>and had bathed in the royal pleasure-tank, he went at sunset and sat down on the royal resting-stone with the intention of adorning himself. Then gathered around him his attendants with diverse-colored cloths, many kinds and styles of ornaments, and with garlands, perfumes, and ointments. At that instant the throne on which Sakka was sitting grew hot. And Sakka, considering who it could be that was desirous of dislodging him, perceived that it was the time of the adornment of a Future Buddha. And addressing Vissakamma, he said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My good Vissakamma, to-night, in the middle watch, prince Siddhattha will go forth on the Great Retirement, and this is his last adorning of himself. Go to the park, and adorn that eminent man with celestial ornaments."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very well," said Vissakamma, in assent; and came on the instant, by his superhuman power, into the presence of the Future Buddha. And assuming the guise of a barber, he took from the real barber the turban-cloth, and began to wind it round the Future Buddha's head; but as soon as the Future Buddha felt the touch of his hand, he knew that it was no man, but a god.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now once round his head took up a thousand cloths, and the fold was like to a circlet of precious stones; the second time round took another thousand cloths, and so on, until ten times round had taken up ten thousand cloths. Now let no one think, "How was it possible to use so many cloths on one small head?" for the very largest of them all had only the size of a s&acirc;ma-creeper blossom, and the others that of kutumbaka flowers. Thus the Future Buddha's head resembled a kuyyaka blossom twisted about with lotus filaments.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having adorned himself with great richness,--while adepts in different kinds of tabors and tom-toms were showing their skill, and Brahmans with cries of victory and joy, and bards and poets with propitious words and shouts of praise saluted him,--he mounted his superbly decorated chariot.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, Suddhodana the king, having heard that</P>

<P>the mother of R&acirc;hula had brought forth a son, sent a messenger, saying, "Announce the glad news to my son."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing the message, the Future Buddha said, "An impediment [r&acirc;hula] has been born; a fetter has been born."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did my son say?" questioned the king; and when he had heard the answer, he said, "My grandson's name shall be prince R&acirc;hula from this very day."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Future Buddha in his splendid chariot entered the city with a pomp and magnificence of glory that enraptured all minds. At the same moment Kis&acirc; Gotam&icirc;, a virgin of the warrior caste, ascended to the roof of her palace, and beheld tile beauty and majesty of the Future Buddha, as he circumambulated the city; and in her pleasure and satisfaction at the sight, she burst forth into this song of joy:--</P>

Full happy now that father is,<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hearing this, the Future Buddha thought, "In beholding a handsome figure the heart of a mother attains Nirvana, the heart of a father attains Nirvana, the heart of a wife attains Nirvana. This is what she says. But wherein does Nirvana consist? "And to him, whose mind was already averse to passion, the answer came: "When the fire of lust is extinct, that is Nirvana; when the fires of hatred and infatuation are extinct, that is Nirvana; when pride, false belief, and all other passions and torments are extinct, that is Nirvana. She has taught me a good lesson. Certainly, Nirvana is what I am looking for. It behooves me this very day to quit the household life, and to retire from the world in quest of Nirvana.<A NAME="page_59_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_59_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> I will send this lady a teacher's fee."

<P>loosening from his neck a pearl necklace worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, he sent it to Kis&acirc; Gotam&icirc;. And great was her satisfaction at this, for she thought, "Prince Siddhattha has fallen in love with me, and has sent me a present."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Future Buddha entered his palace in great splendor, and lay on his couch of state. And straightway richly dressed women, skilled in all manner of dance and song, and beautiful as celestial nymphs, gathered about him with all kinds of musical instruments, and with dance, song, and music they endeavored to please him. But the Future Buddha's aversion to passion did not allow him to take pleasure in the spectacle, and he fell into a brief slumber. And the women, exclaiming, "He for whose sake we should perform has fallen asleep. Of what use is it to weary ourselves any longer?" threw their various instruments on the ground, and lay down. And the lamps fed with sweet-smelling oil continued to burn. And the Future Buddha awoke, and seating himself cross-legged on his couch, perceived these women lying asleep, with their musical instruments scattered about them on the floor,--some with their bodies wet with trickling phlegm and spittle; some grinding their teeth, and muttering and talking in their sleep; some with their mouths open; and some with their dress fallen apart so as plainly to</P>

<P>disclose their loathsome nakedness. This great alteration in their appearance still further increased his aversion for sensual pleasures. To him that magnificent apartment, as splendid as the palace of Sakka, began to seem like a cemetery filled with dead bodies impaled and left to rot; and the three modes of existence appeared like houses all ablaze. And breathing forth the solemn utterance, "How oppressive and stifling is it all!" his mind turned ardently to retiring from the world. "It behooves me to go forth on the Great Retirement this very day," said he; and he arose from his couch, and coming near the door, called out,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who's there?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish to go forth on the Great Retirement to-day. Saddle a horse for me."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sire." And taking saddle and bridle with him, the courtier started for the stable. There, by the light of lamps fed with sweet-smelling oils, he perceived the mighty steed Kanthaka in his pleasant quarters, under a canopy of cloth beautified with a pattern of jasmine flowers.

<P>one for me to saddle to-day," thought he; and he saddled Kanthaka.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is drawing the girth very tight," thought Kanthaka, whilst he was being saddled;" it is not at all as on other days, when I am saddled for rides in the park and the like. It must be that to-day my master wishes to issue forth on the Great Retirement." And in his delight he neighed a loud neigh. And that neigh would have spread through the whole town, had not the gods stopped the sound, and suffered no one to hear it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Future Buddha, after he had sent Channa on his errand, thought to himself, "will take just one look at my son;" and, rising from the couch on which he was sitting, he went to the suite of apartments occupied by the mother of Rahula, and opened the door of her chamber. Within the chamber was burning a lamp fed with sweet-smelling oil, and the mother of R&acirc;hula lay sleeping on a couch strewn deep with jasmine and other flowers, her hand resting on the head of her son. When the Future Buddha reached the threshold, he paused, and gazed at the two from where he stood.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I were to raise my wife's hand from off the child's head, and take him up, she would awake, and thus prevent my departure. I will first become a Buddha, and then come back and see my son." So saying, he descended from the palace.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that which is said in the J&acirc;taka Commentary, "At that time R&acirc;hula was seven days old, "is not found in the other commentaries. Therefore the account above given is to be accepted.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Future Buddha had thus descended from the palace, he came near to his horse, and said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear Kanthaka, save me now this one night; and then, when thanks to you I have become a Buddha, I will save the world of gods and men." And thereupon he vaulted upon Kanthaka's back.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Kanthaka was eighteen cubits long from his neck to his tail, and of corresponding height; he was strong and swift, and white all over like a polished conch-shell. If he neighed or stamped, the sound was so loud as to spread</P>

<P>through the whole city; therefore the gods exerted their power, and muffled the sound of his neighing, so that no one heard it; and at every step he took they placed the palms of their hands under his feet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Future Buddha rode on the mighty back of the mighty steed, made Channa hold on by the tail, and so arrived at midnight at the great gate of the city.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the king, in order that the Future Buddha should not at any time go out of the city without his knowledge, had caused each of the two leaves of the gate to be made so heavy as to need a thousand men to move it. But the Future Buddha had a vigor and a strength that was equal, when reckoned in elephant-power, to the strength of ten thousand million elephants, and, reckoned in man-power, to the strength of a hundred thousand million men.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If," thought he, "the gate does not open, I will straightway grip tight hold of Kanthaka with my thighs, and, seated as I am on Kanthaka's back, and with Channa holding on by the tail, I will leap up and carry them both with me over the wall, although its height be eighteen cubits."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If," thought Channa, "the gate is not opened, I will place my master on my shoulder, and tucking Kanthaka under my arm by passing my right hand round him and under his belly, I will leap up and carry them both with me over the wall."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If," thought Kanthaka, "the gate is not opened, with my master seated as he is on my back, and with Channa holding on by my tail, I will leap up and carry them both with me over the wall."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if the gate had not opened, verily one or another of these three persons would have accomplished that whereof he thought; but the divinity that inhabited the gate opened it for them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment came M&acirc;ra,<A NAME="page_63_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_63_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> with the intention of persuading</P>

<P>the Future Buddha to turn back; and standing in the air, he said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, go not forth! For on the seventh day from now the wheel of empire will appear to you, and you shall rule over the four great continents and their two thousand attendant isles. Sir, turn back!"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Vasavatti."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"M&acirc;ra, I knew that the wheel of empire was on the point of appearing to me; but I do not wish for sovereignty. I am about to cause the ten thousand worlds to thunder with my becoming a Buddha."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I shall catch you," thought M&acirc;ra, "the very first time you have a lustful, malicious, or unkind thought." And, like an ever-present shadow, he followed after, ever on the watch for some slip.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the Future Buddha, casting away with indifference a universal sovereignty already in his grasp,--spewing it out as if it were but phlegm,--departed from the city in great splendor on the full-moon day of the month &Acirc;s&acirc;lhi,<A NAME="page_64_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_64_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> when the moon was in Libra. And when he had gone out from the city, he became desirous of looking back at it; but no sooner had the thought arisen in his mind, than the broad earth, seeming to fear lest the Great Being might neglect to perform the act of looking back, split and turned round like a potter's wheel.<A NAME="page_64_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_64_note_2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A> When the Future Buddha had stood a while facing the city and gazing upon it, and had indicated in that place the spot for the "Shrine of the Turning Back of Kanthaka," he turned Kanthaka in the direction in which he meant to go, and proceeded on his way in great honor and exceeding glory.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they say the deities bore sixty thousand torches in front of him, and sixty thousand behind him, and sixty</P>

<P>thousand on the right hand, and sixty thousand on the left hand. Other deities, standing on the rim of the world, bore torches past all numbering; and still other deities, as well as serpents and birds, accompanied him, and did him homage with heavenly perfumes, garlands, sandal-wood powder, and incense. And the sky was as full of coral flowers as it is of pouring water at the height of the rainy season. Celestial choruses were heard; and on every side bands of music played, some of eight instruments, and some of sixty,--sixty-eight hundred thousand instruments in all. It was as when the storm-clouds thunder on the sea, or when the ocean roars against the Yugandhara rocks.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancing in this glory, the Future Buddha in one night passed through three kingdoms, and at the end of thirty leagues he came to the river named Anom&acirc;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But was this as far as the horse could go? Certainly not. For he was able to travel round the world from end to end, as it were round the rim of a wheel lying on its hub, and yet get back before breakfast and eat the food prepared for him. But on this occasion the fragrant garlands and other offerings which the gods and the serpents and the birds threw down upon him from the sky buried him up to his haunches; and as he was obliged to drag his body and cut his way through the tangled mass, he was greatly delayed. Hence it was that he went only thirty leagues.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Future Buddha, stopping on the river-bank, said to Channa,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the name of this river?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sire, its name is Anom&acirc; [Illustrious]."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And my retirement from the world shall also be called Anom&acirc;," replied the Future Buddha. Saying this, he gave the signal to his horse with his heel; and the horse sprang over the river, which had a breadth of eight usabhas,<A NAME="page_65_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_65_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> and landed on the opposite bank. And the Future Buddha, dismounting and standing on the sandy beach that stretched away like a sheet of silver, said to Channa,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My good Channa, take these ornaments and Kanthaka and go home. I am about to retire from the world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sire, I also will retire from the world."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three times the Future Buddha refused him, saying, "It is not for you to retire from the world. Go now!" and made him take the ornaments and Kanthaka.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next he thought, "These locks of mine are not suited to a monk; but there is no one fit to cut the hair of a Future Buddha. Therefore I will cut them off myself with my sword." And grasping a simitar with his right hand, he seized his top-knot with his left hand, and cut it off, together with the diadem. His hair thus became two finger-breadths in length, and curling to the right, lay close to his head. As long as he lived it remained of that length, and the beard was proportionate. And never again did he have to cut either hair or beard.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Future Buddha seized hold of his top-knot and diadem, and threw them into the air, saying,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I am to become a Buddha, let them stay in the sky; but if not, let them fall to the ground."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top-knot and jewelled turban mounted for a distance of a league into the air, and there came to a stop. And Sakka, the king of the gods, perceiving them with his divine eye, received them in an appropriate jewelled casket, and established it in the Heaven of the Thirty-three as the "Shrine of the Diadem."</P>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Future Buddha thought, "These garments of mine, made of Benares cloth, are not suited to a monk."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Mah&acirc;-Brahma god, Ghat&icirc;k&acirc;ra, who had been a friend of his in the time of the Buddha Kassapa, and whose affection for him had not grown old in the long interval. since that Buddha, thought to himself,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To-day my friend has gone forth on the Great Retirement. I will bring him the requisites of a monk."</P>

<P>Taking the above eight requisites of a monk, he gave them to him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Future Buddha had put on this most excellent vesture, the symbol of saintship and of retirement from the world, he dismissed Channa, saying,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Channa, go tell my father and my mother from me that I am well."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Channa did obeisance to the Future Buddha; and keeping his right side towards him, he departed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kanthaka, who had stood listening to the Future Buddha while he was conferring with Channa, was unable to bear his grief at the thought, "I shall never see my master any more." And as he passed out of sight, his heart burst, and he died, and was reborn in the Heaven of the Thirty-three as the god Kanthaka.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first the grief of Channa had been but single; but now he was oppressed with a second sorrow in the death of Kanthaka, and came weeping and wailing to the city.</P>

</P>

<P><A NAME="page_59_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_59_fr_1">1</A> The Future Buddha puns upon the word "happy" in Kis&acirc; Gotam&icirc;'s verses. The word in P&acirc;li is <I>nibbuta</I>, and is in form a past passive participle of a verb which perhaps does not occur in P&acirc;li in any finite form, but which appears in Sanskrit as <I>nirvr</I>. Now there is a P&acirc;li verb of which the third person singular present indicative is <I>nibb&acirc;yati</I>, and from this verb is formed the verbal noun <I>nibb&acirc;na</I> (Sanskrit, <I>Nirv&acirc;na</I>). <I>Nibbuta</I> is constantly made to do duty as past passive participle to this verb, so that what would be the true form (<I>nibb&acirc;ta</I>) is never found. The Future Buddha therefore puns when he pretends that Kis&acirc; Gotam&icirc; was using <I>nibbuta</I> as the participle of <I>nibb&acirc;yati</I>, and was urging him to Nirvana.</P>

<P>The verb <I>nibb&acirc;yati</I> means "to be extinguished," as the flame of a candle; and, when used as a metaphysical term, refers to the fires of lust, desire, etc. And as when fire is extinguished coolness results (a consummation devoutly to be wished in a hot climate like India), the verb acquires the further meaning of "be assuaged," "become happy." And in like manner the verbal noun Nirvana (in P&acirc;li <I>nibb&acirc;na</I>), meaning both literally and metaphorically "becoming extinguished," comes to stand for the <I>summum bonum</I>.</P>

<P>I add a retranslation of the passage, to show the punning meanings given by the Future Buddha to the words, <I>nibbuta</I>, <I>nibb&acirc;yati</I>, and Nirvana:--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>"Nirvana hath that mother gained,<BR>
Nirvana hath that father gained,<BR>
Nirvana hath that woman gained,<BR>
Who owns this lord so glorious!"<BR></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>On hearing this, the Future Buddha thought, "In beholding a handsome form the heart of a mother is made happy (<I>nibb&acirc;yati</I>), the heart of a father is made happy, the heart of a wife is made happy. This is what she says. But wherein does happiness (<I>nibbuta</I>) consist?" And to him whose mind was already averse to passion, the answer came: "When the fire of lust is assuaged (<I>nibbuta</I>), that is happiness (<I>nibbuta</I>); when the fires of hatred and infatuation are assuaged, that is happiness; when pride, false belief, and all other passions and torments are assuaged, that is happiness. She has taught me a good lesson. Certainly, happiness (Nirvana) is what I am looking for. It behooves me this very day to quit the household life and to retire from the world in quest of happiness. I will send this lady a teacher's fee."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N<SMALL>OW</SMALL> the Future Buddha, having thus retired from the world,--in that place there was a mango-grove named Anupiya, and here he first spent a week in the joy of having retired from the world,--in one day went on foot to R&acirc;jagaha, a distance of thirty leagues, and entering the city, he begged for food from house to house without passing any by. By the beauty of the Future Buddha, the whole city was thrown into a commotion, like that into which R&acirc;jagaha was thrown by the entrance of Dhanap&acirc;laka, or like that into which the</P>

<P>heavenly city was thrown by the entrance of the chief of the Titans.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then ran the king's men to the palace, and made announcement,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sire, there is a being of such and such appearance going about the city begging for food. Whether he be a god, or a man, or a serpent, or a bird, we do not know."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the king, standing on the roof of his palace, and thence beholding the Great Being, became amazed and astonished, and commanded his men,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look ye now! Go and investigate this! If this person be not a man, he will vanish from sight as soon as he leaves the city; if, namely, he be a god, he will depart by way of the air; if a serpent, he will sink into the ground. But if he be a human being, he will eat the food he has obtained in alms."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Great Being, after collecting a number of scraps, sufficient, as he judged, for his sustenance, left the city by the same gate he had entered, and sitting down with his face to the east, in the shade of Pandava rock, he attempted to eat his meal. But his stomach turned, and he felt as if his inwards were on the point of coming out by his mouth. Thereupon, in the midst of his distress at that repulsive food, --for in that existence he had never before so much as seen such fare,--he began to admonish himself, saying, "Siddhattha, although you were born into a family having plenty to eat and drink, into a station in life where you lived on fragrant third season's rice<A NAME="page_68_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_68_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> with various sauces of the finest flavors, yet when you saw a monk clad in garments taken from the rubbish heap, you exclaimed, 'Oh, when shall I be like him, and eat food which I have begged? Will that time ever come?' And then you retired from the world. And</P>

<P>now that you have your wish, and have renounced all, what, pray, is this you are doing?" When he had thus admonished himself, his disgust subsided, and he ate his meal.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the king's men went and announced to the king what they had seen. And the king, on hearing the report of the messengers, issued hastily from the city, and approaching the Future Buddha, and being pleased with his deportment, he tendered him all his kingly glory.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great king," replied the Future Buddha, "I do not seek for the gratification of my senses or my passions, but have retired from the world for the sake of the supreme and absolute enlightenment."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Verily," said the king, when his repeated offers had all been refused, "you are sure to become a Buddha; but when that happens, your first journey must be to my kingdom."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is an abridgment, but the full account, beginning with the lines,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Future Buddha, having made the king the required promise, proceeded on his way; and coming to &Acirc;l&acirc;ra K&acirc;l&acirc;ma and Uddaka, the disciple of R&acirc;ma, he acquired from them the eight stages of meditation. But becoming convinced that they did not lead to enlightenment,<A NAME="page_69_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_69_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> he ceased to practise them. And being desirous of making the Great Struggle, so as to show the world of gods and men his fortitude and heroism, he went to Uruvel&acirc;, and saying, "Truly, delightful is this spot," he there took up his abode, and began the Great Struggle.</P>

<P>years of the Great Struggle, they swept his cell, and did all manner of service for him, and kept constantly at his beck and call, all the time saying, "Now he will become a Buddha, now he will become a Buddha."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Future Buddha, thinking, "I will carry austerity to the uttermost," tried various plans, such as living on one sesamum seed or on one grain of rice a day, and even ceased taking nourishment altogether, and moreover rebuffed the gods when they came and attempted to infuse nourishment through the pores of his skin. By this lack of nourishment. his body became emaciated to the last degree, and lost its golden color, and became black, and his thirty-two physical characteristics as a great being became obscured. Now, one day, as he was deep in a trance of suppressed breathing, he was attacked by violent pains, and fell senseless to the ground, at one end of his walking-place.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certain of the deities said, "The monk Gotama is dead;" but others said, "This is a practice of the saints." Then those who thought he was dead went to king Suddhodana, and announced to him that his son was dead.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did he die after becoming a Buddha, or before?" asked the king.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was unable to become a Buddha, but in making the Struggle, he fell to the ground and died."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the king heard this, he refused to credit it, saying, "I do not believe it. Death cannot come to my son before he attains to enlightenment."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why would not the king believe it? Because of the miracles he had seen,--the first when the ascetic K&acirc;ladevala had been compelled to do homage to the Future Buddha, and the other which happened to the rose-apple tree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Future Buddha recovering his consciousness, and standing up, the deities went a second time to the king, and told him that his son was well again.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the king, "I knew that my son could not have died."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the six years which the Great Being thus spent in austerities were like time spent in endeavoring to tie the air</P>

<P>into knots. And coming to the decision, "These austerities are not the way to enlightenment," he went begging through villages and market-towns for ordinary material food, and lived upon it. And his thirty-two physical characteristics as a great being again appeared, and the color of his body became like unto gold.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the band of five priests thought, "It is now six years that this man has been performing austerities without being able to attain to omniscience. And how much less can he be expected to do so in future, now that he has again taken to ordinary material food begged from town to town! He has become luxurious, and given up the Struggle. For us to look for any benefit to come from that quarter would be as reasonable as if a man were to imagine he could bathe his head in a dew-drop. We will have nothing more to do with him." With that they took their bowls and robes, and left the Great Being, and going eighteen leagues off, entered Isipatana.</P>

<H4><P ALIGN="center">&sect; 8. THE ATTAINMENT OF BUDDHASHIP.</P></H4>

<P ALIGN="center"><SMALL>Translated from the Introduction to the J&acirc;taka (i.68<SUP>5</SUP>).</SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N<SMALL>OW</SMALL> at that time there lived in Uruvel&acirc; a girl named Suj&acirc;t&acirc;, who had been born in the family of the householder Sen&acirc;ni, in General's Town. On reaching maturity she made a prayer to a certain banyan-tree, saying, "If I get a husband of equal rank with myself, and my first-born is a son, I will make a yearly offering to you of the value of a hundred thousand pieces of money." And her prayer had been successful.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wishing to make her offering on the day of full moon of the month Vis&acirc;kh&acirc;, full six years after the Great Being commenced his austerities, she first pastured a thousand cows in Latthimadhu Wood, and fed their milk to five hundred cows and the milk of these five hundred cows to two hundred and fifty, and so on down to feeding the milk</P>

<P>of sixteen cows to eight. This "working the milk in and in," as it is called, was done to increase the thickness and the sweetness and the strength-giving properties of the milk. And when it came to be the full-moon day of Vis&acirc;kh&acirc;, she resolved to make her offering, and rose up early in the morning, just when night was breaking into day, and gave orders to milk the eight cows. The calves had not come at the teats of the cows; yet as soon as new pails were put under the udders, the milk flowed in streams of its own accord. When she saw this miracle, Suj&acirc;t&acirc; took the milk with her own hands and placed it in a new vessel, and herself made a fire and began to cook it. While the milk-rice was cooking, immense bubbles arose, and turning to the right, went round together; but not a single drop ran over the edge, and not a particle of smoke went up from the fireplace. On this occasion the four guardian angels were present, and stood guard over the fireplace; Mah&acirc;-Brahma bore aloft the canopy of state, and Sakka raked the fire-brands together and made the fire blaze up brightly. And just as a man crushes honey out of a honey-comb that has formed around a stick, so the deities by their superhuman power collected an amount of vital sap sufficient for the sustenance of the gods and men of all the four great continents and their two thousand attendant isles, and infused it into the milk-rice. At other times, to be sure, the deities infuse this sap into each mouthful; but on the day of the attainment of the Buddhaship, and on the day of decease, they place it in the kettle itself.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suj&acirc;t&acirc; had seen so many miracles appear to her in one day, she said to her slave-girl Punn&acirc;,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Punn&acirc;, dear girl, the deity is very graciously disposed to us to-day. I have never before seen so many marvellous things happen in so short a time. Run quickly, and get everything ready at the holy place."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, my lady," replied the slave-girl, and ran in great haste to the foot of the tree.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that night the Future Buddha had five great dreams, and on considering their meaning reached the conclusion, "Without doubt I shall become a Buddha this very day."</P>

<P>And when night was over, and he had cared for his person, he came early in the morning to that tree, to await the hour to go begging. And when he sat down he illumined the whole tree with his radiance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came Punn&acirc;, and saw the Future Buddha sitting at the foot of the tree, contemplating the eastern quarter of the world. And when she beheld the radiance from his body lighting up the whole tree with a golden color, she became greatly excited, saying to herself, "Our deity, methinks, has come down from the tree to-day, and has seated himself, ready to receive our offering in person." And she ran in great haste, and told Suj&acirc;t&acirc; of the matter.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suj&acirc;t&acirc; heard this news, she was overjoyed; and saying, "From this day forth be to me in the room of an eldest daughter," she decked Punn&acirc; with all the ornaments appropriate to that position. And since a Future Buddha on the day he attains the Buddhaship must needs receive a golden dish worth a hundred thousand pieces of money, therefore the idea occurred to her of putting the milk-rice in a golden dish. And bringing out a golden dish that was worth a hundred thousand, she took up the cooking-vessel and began to pour out the milk-rice. All the milk-rice rolled off like water from a lotus-leaf, and exactly filled the dish. Then, covering the dish with another, which was also made of gold, and wrapping it in a cloth, she adorned herself in all her ornaments, and with the dish on her head proceeded in state to the foot of the banyan-tree. As soon as she caught sight of the Future Buddha she was exceedingly overjoyed, supposing him to be the tree-god; and as she advanced she kept constantly bowing. And taking the pot from her head, she uncovered it, and with some flower-scented water in a golden vase, drew near and took up a position close to the Future Buddha. The earthenware bowl which the Future Buddha had kept so long, and which had been given him by Ghat&icirc;kar&acirc;, the Mah&acirc;-Brahma god, at that instant disappeared; and the Future Buddha, stretching out his right hand in an attempt to find his bowl, grasped the vase of water. Next Suj&acirc;t&acirc; placed the dish of milk-rice in the hand of the Great</P>

<P>Being. Then the Great Being looked at Suj&acirc;t&acirc;; and she perceived that he was a holy man, and did obeisance, and said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord, accept my donation, and go whithersoever it seemeth to you good." And adding, "May your wishes prosper like mine own," she departed, caring no more for her golden dish worth a hundred thousand pieces of money than if it had been a dead leaf.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Future Buddha rose from his seat and walked round the tree with his right side towards it; and taking the dish, he proceeded to the banks of the Nera&ntilde;jar&acirc; and descended into its waters, just as many thousands of Future Buddhas before him had descended on the day of their complete enlightenment.--The spot where he bathed is now a place of pilgrimage named Suppatitthita, and here he deposited the dish on the bank before descending into the water.--After bathing he dressed himself in that garb of saintship which had been the dress of many hundreds of thousands of Future Buddhas before him; and sitting down with his face to the east, he made the whole of the thick, sweet milk-rice into forty-nine pellets of the size of the fruit of the single-seeded palmyra-tree, and ate it. And he took no further nourishment until the end of the seven weeks, or forty-nine days, which he spent on the throne of wisdom after he had become a Buddha. During all that time he had no other nourishment; he neither bathed, nor rinsed his mouth, nor did he ease himself; but was wholly taken up by the delights of the Trances, of the Paths, and of the Fruits.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when he had consumed the milk-rice, he took the golden dish; and saying, "If I am to succeed in becoming a Buddha to-day, let this dish go up-stream; but if not, let it go down-stream," he threw it into the water. And it swam, cleaving the stream, until it came to the middle of the river, and then, like a fleet horse, it ran up-stream for a distance of eighty cubits, keeping all the while in the middle of the stream. Then it dived into a whirlpool and went to the palace of the black snake-king, and hit, "click! click!" against the dishes that had been used by the last three Buddhas, and</P>

<P>took its place at the end of the row. When the black snake-king heard the noise, he exclaimed,--</P>

<TABLE ALIGN="center" CELLPADDING="5">
<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>"But yesterday a Buddha lived,<BR>
And now another has been born."<BR></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>and so on, through several hundred laudatory verses. As a matter of only yesterday and to-day did the times of the snake-king's appearance above ground seem to him; and his body at such times towered up into the sky to a height of one and three quarters leagues.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Future Buddha took his noonday rest on the banks of the river, in a grove of sal-trees in full bloom. And at nightfall, at the time the flowers droop on their stalks, he rose up, like a lion when he bestirs himself, and went towards the Bo-tree, along a road which the gods had decked, and which was eight usabhas wide.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snakes, the fairies, the birds, and other classes of beings did him homage with celestial perfumes, flowers, and other offerings, and celestial choruses poured forth heavenly music; so that the ten thousand worlds were filled with these perfumes, garlands, and shouts of acclaim.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then there came from the opposite direction a grasscutter named Sotthiya, and he was carrying grass. And when he saw the Great Being, that he was a holy man, he gave him eight handfuls of grass. The Future Buddha took the grass, and ascending the throne of wisdom, stood on the southern side and faced the north. Instantly the southern half of the world sank, until it seemed to touch the Av&icirc;ci hell, while the northern half rose to the highest of the heavens.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Methinks," said the Future Buddha, "this cannot be the place for the attainment of the supreme wisdom;" and walking round the tree with his right side towards it, he came to the western side and faced the east. Then the western half of the world sank, until it seemed to touch the Av&icirc;ci hell, while the eastern half rose to the highest of the heavens. Wherever, indeed, he stood, the broad earth rose and fell, as though it had been a huge cart-wheel lying on its hub, and some one were treading on the rim.</P>

</TABLE>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Methinks," said the Future Buddha, "this also cannot be the place for the attainment of supreme wisdom;" and walking round the tree with his right side towards it, he came to the northern side and faced the south. Then the northern half of the world sank, until it seemed to touch the Av&icirc;ci hell, while the southern half rose to the highest of the heavens.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Methinks," said the Future Buddha, "this also cannot be the place for the attainment of supreme wisdom;" and walking round the tree with his right side towards it, he came to the eastern side and faced the west. Now it is on the eastern side of their Bo-trees that all The Buddhas have sat cross-legged, and that side neither trembles nor quakes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Great Being, saying to himself, "This is the immovable spot on which all The Buddhas have planted themselves! This is the place for destroying passion's net!" took hold of his handful of grass by one end, and shook it out there. And straightway the blades of grass formed themselves into a seat fourteen cubits long, of such symmetry of shape as not even the most skilful painter or carver could design.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Future Buddha turned his back to the trunk of the Bo-tree and faced the east. And making the mighty resolution, "Let my skin, and sinews, and bones become dry, and welcome! and let all the flesh and blood in my body dry up! but never from this seat will I stir, until I have attained the supreme and absolute wisdom!" he sat himself down cross-legged in an unconquerable position, from which not even the descent of a hundred thunder-bolts at once could have dislodged him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point the god M&acirc;ra, exclaiming, "Prince Siddhattha is desirous of passing beyond my control, but I will never allow it!" went and announced the news to his army, and sounding the M&acirc;ra war-cry, drew out for battle. Now M&acirc;ra's army extended in front of him for twelve leagues, and to the right and to the left for twelve leagues, and in the rear as far as to the confines of the world, and it was nine leagues high. And when it shouted, it made an earthquake-like</P>

<P>roaring and rumbling over a space of a thousand leagues. And the god M&acirc;ra, mounting his elephant, which was a hundred and fifty leagues high, and had the name "Girded-with-mountains," caused a thousand arms to appear on his body, and with these he grasped a variety of weapons. Also in the remainder of that army, no two persons carried the same weapon; and diverse also in their appearances and countenances, the host swept on like a flood to overwhelm the Great Being.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now deities throughout the ten thousand worlds were busy singing the praises of the Great Being. Sakka, the king of the gods, was blowing the conch-shell Vijayuttara. (This conch, they say, was a hundred and twenty cubits long, and when once it had been filled with wind, it would sound for four months before it stopped.) The great black snake-king sang more than a hundred laudatory verses. And Mah&acirc;-Brahma stood holding aloft the white umbrella. But as M&acirc;ra's army gradually drew near to the throne of wisdom, not one of these gods was able to stand his ground, but each fled straight before him. The black snake-king dived into the ground, and coming to the snake-abode, Ma&ntilde;jerika, which was five hundred leagues in extent, he covered his face with both hands and lay down. Sakka slung his conch-shell Vijayuttara over his back, and took up his position on the rim of the world. Mah&acirc;-Brahma left the white umbrella at the end of the world, and fled to his Brahma-abode. Not a single deity was able to stand his ground, and the Great Being was left sitting alone.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said M&acirc;ra to his followers,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My friends, Siddhattha, the son of Suddhodana, is far greater than any other man, and we shall never be able to fight him in front. We will attack him from behind." All the gods had now disappeared, and the Great Being looked around on three sides, and said to himself, "There is no one here." Then looking to the north, he perceived M&acirc;ra's army coming on like a flood, and said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is this multitude exerting all their strength and power against me alone. My mother and father are not here,</P>

<!--------------------------p. 78-------------------------->

<P>nor my brother, nor any other relative. But I have these Ten Perfections, like old retainers long cherished at my board. It therefore behooves me to make the Ten Perfections my shield and my sword, and to strike a blow with them that shall destroy this strong array." And he remained sitting, and reflected on the Ten Perfections.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon the god M&acirc;ra caused a whirlwind, thinking, "By this will I drive away Siddhattha." Straightway the east wind and all the other different winds began to blow; but although these winds could have torn their way through mountain-peaks half a league, or two leagues, or three leagues high, or have uprooted forest-shrubs and trees, or have reduced to powder and scattered in all directions, villages and towns, yet when they reached the Future Buddha, such was the energy of the Great Being's merit, they lost all power and were not able to cause so much as a fluttering of the edge of his priestly robe.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he caused a great rain-storm, saying, "With water will I overwhelm and drown him." And through his mighty power, clouds of a hundred strata, and clouds of a thousand strata arose, and also the other different kinds. And these rained down, until the earth became gullied by the torrents of water which fell, and until the floods had risen over the tops of every forest-tree. But on coming to the Great Being, this mighty inundation was not able to wet his priestly robes as much as a dew-drop would have done.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he caused a shower of rocks, in which immense mountain-peaks flew smoking and flaming through the sky. But on reaching the Future Buddha they became celestial bouquets of flowers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he caused a shower of weapons, in which single-edged, and double-edged swords, spears, and arrows flew smoking and flaming through the sky. But on reaching the Future Buddha they became celestial flowers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he caused a shower of live coals, in which live coals as red as kimsuka flowers flew through the sky. But they scattered themselves at the Future Buddha's feet as a shower of celestial flowers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he caused a shower of hot ashes, in which ashes that glowed like fire flew through the sky. But they fell at the Future Buddha's feet as sandal-wood powder.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he caused a shower of sand, in which very fine sand flew smoking and flaming through the sky. But it fell at the Future Buddha's feet as celestial flowers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he caused a shower of mud, in which mud flew smoking and flaming through the sky. But it fell at the Future Buddha's feet as celestial ointment.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he caused a darkness, thinking, "By this will I frighten Siddhattha, and drive him away." And the darkness became fourfold, and very dense. But on reaching the Future Buddha it disappeared like darkness before the light of the sun.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M&acirc;ra, being thus unable with these nine storms of wind, rain, rocks, weapons, live coals, hot ashes, sand, mud, and darkness, to drive away the Future Buddha, gave command to his followers, "Look ye now! Why stand ye still? Seize, kill, drive away this prince!" And, arming himself with a discus, and seated upon the shoulders of the elephant "Girded-with-mountains," he drew near the Future Buddha, and said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siddhattha, arise from this seat! It does not belong to you, but to me."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Great Being heard this he said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"M&acirc;ra, you have not fulfilled the Ten Perfections in any of their three grades; nor have you made the five great donations;<A NAME="page_79_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_79_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> nor have you striven for knowledge, nor for the welfare of the world, nor for enlightenment. This seat does not belong to you, but to me."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to restrain his fury, the enraged M&acirc;ra now hurled his discus. But the Great Being reflected on the Ten Perfections, and the discus changed into a canopy of flowers,</P>

<!--------------------------p. 80-------------------------->

<P>and remained suspended over his head. Yet they say that this keen-edged discus, when at other times M&acirc;ra hurled it in anger, would cut through solid stone pillars as if they had been the tips of bamboo shoots. But on this occasion it became a canopy of flowers. Then the followers of M&acirc;ra began hurling immense mountain-crags, saying, "This will make him get up from his seat and flee." But the Great Being kept his thoughts on the Ten Perfections, and the crags also became wreaths of flowers, and then fell to the ground.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the gods meanwhile were standing on the rim of the world, and craning their necks to look, saying,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, woe the day! The handsome form of prince Siddhattha will surely be destroyed! What will he do to save himself?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Great Being, after his assertion that the seat which Future Buddhas had always used on the day of their complete enlightenment belonged to him, continued, and said,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"M&acirc;ra, who is witness to your having given donations?" Said M&acirc;ra, "All these, as many as you see here, are my witnesses;" and he stretched out his hand in the direction of his army. And instantly from M&acirc;ra's army came a roar, "I am his witness! I am his witness!" which was like to the roar of an earthquake.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said M&acirc;ra to the Great Being,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Siddhattha, who is witness to your having given donations?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your witnesses," replied the Great Being, "are animate beings, and I have no animate witnesses present. However, not to mention the donations which I gave in other existences, the great seven-hundred-fold donation which I gave in my Vessantara existence shall now be testified to by the solid earth, inanimate though she be." And drawing forth his right hand from beneath his priestly robe, he stretched it out towards the mighty earth, and said, "Are you witness, or are you not, to my having given a great seven-hundred-fold donation in my Vessantara existence?"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty earth thundered, "I bear you witness!" with a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand roars, as if to overwhelm the army of M&acirc;ra.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while the Great Being was thus calling to mind the donation he gave in his Vessantara existence, and saying to himself, "Siddhattha, that was a great and excellent donation which you gave," the hundred-and-fifty-league-high elephant "Girded-with-mountains" fell upon his knees before the Great Being. And the followers of M&acirc;ra fled away in all directions. No two went the same way, but leaving their head-ornaments and their cloaks behind, they fled straight before them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hosts of the gods, when they saw the army of M&acirc;ra flee, cried out, "M&acirc;ra is defeated! Prince Siddhattha has conquered! Let us go celebrate the victory!" And the snakes egging on the snakes, the birds the birds, the deities the deities, and the Brahma-angels the Brahma-angels, they came with perfumes, garlands, and other offerings in their hands to the Great Being on the throne of wisdom. And as they came,--</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the remaining deities, also, throughout the ten thousand worlds, made offerings of garlands, perfumes, and ointments, and in many a hymn extolled him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was before the sun had set that the Great Being thus vanquished the army of M&acirc;ra. And then, while the Bo-tree in homage rained red, coral-like sprigs upon his priestly robes, he acquired in the first watch of the night the knowledge of previous existences; in the middle watch of the night, the divine eye; and in the last watch of the night, his intellect fathomed Dependent Origination.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while he was musing on the twelve terms of Dependent Origination, forwards and backwards, round and back again, the ten thousand worlds quaked twelve times, as far as to their ocean boundaries. And when the Great Being, at the dawning of the day, had thus made the ten thousand worlds thunder with his attainment of omniscience, all these worlds became most gloriously adorned. Flags and banners erected on the eastern rim of the world let their streamers fly to the western rim of the world; likewise those erected on the western rim of the world, to the eastern rim of the world; those erected on the northern rim of the world, to the southern rim of the world; and those erected on the southern rim of the world, to the northern rim of the world; while those erected on the level of the earth let theirs fly until they beat against the Brahma-world; and those of the Brahma-world let theirs hang down to the level of the earth.
