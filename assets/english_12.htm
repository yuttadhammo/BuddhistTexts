It is physical<br>and it is nutriment in the sense stated, thus it is physical nutriment; so with the rest.<br>It touches (<i>phusati</i>), thus it is contact (<i>phassa</i>); for although this is an immaterial state,<br>it occurs also as the aspect of touching on an object (<i>ārammaṇa—</i>lit. “what is to be<br>leaned on”), which is why it is said to have&nbsp;the characteristic of touching. It wills<br>(<i>cetayati</i>), thus it is volition (<i>cetanā</i>); the meaning is that it arranges (collects) itself<br>together with associated states upon the object. Mental volition is volition occupied<br>with the mind. It cognizes (<i>vijānāti</i>) by conjecturing about rebirth (see XVII.303), thus<br>it is consciousness (<i>viññāṇa</i>&nbsp;= cognition) (Vism-mhṭ 335).</span></nobr></DIV>

Wherever there is the combination<br>of mind-and-matter, there is ramification of formations. Wherever there is ramification<br>of formations, there is production of further becoming in the future. Wherever there<br>is production of further becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging and death.<br>Wherever there is future birth, aging and death, bhikkhus, the end is sorrow, I say,<br>with woe and despair” (S II 101; cf. S II 66).&nbsp;<i>Approaching&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>is explained as “meeting,<br>coinciding, with unabandoned perversions [of perception] due to an object [being<br>perceived as permanent, etc., when it is not].” That is, “perilous since it is not free<br>from the three kinds of suffering.” The quotation given is: “Bhikkhus, due to contact<br>of the kind to be felt as pleasant, pleasant feeling arises. With that feeling as condition<br>there is craving, … thus there is the arising of this whole mass of suffering” (cf. S IV<br>215).&nbsp;<i>Reappearance&nbsp;</i>is “rebirth in some kind of becoming or other. Being flung into a<br>new becoming is perilous because there is no immunity from the risks rooted in<br>reappearance.” The following is quoted: “Not knowing, bhikkhus, a man forms the<br>formation of merit, and his [rebirth] consciousness accords with the merit [tie<br>performed]; he forms the formation of demerit; … he forms the formation of the<br>imperturbable …” (S II 82).&nbsp;<i>Rebirth-linking&nbsp;</i>is the actual linking with the next becoming,<br>which “is perilous since it is not immune from the suffering due to the signs of [the<br>impending] rebirth-linking.” The quotation given is: “Bhikkhus, when there is<br>consciousness as nutriment there is greed (lust), there is delighting …” (S II 102—<br>complete as above).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:236;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4030">29.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:236;left:33"><nobr><span class="ft4030">The meaning is this:&nbsp;<i>just as though a clever butcher</i>, or his&nbsp;<i>apprentice&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>who</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4037">worked for his keep,&nbsp;<i>had killed a cow</i>&nbsp;and divided it up&nbsp;<i>and were seated at&nbsp;the<br>crossroads</i>, reckoned as the intersection of the main roads going in the four<br>directions, having laid it out part by&nbsp;part,&nbsp;<i>so too a bhikkhu reviews the body, however<br>placed&nbsp;</i>because it is in some one of the four postures and&nbsp;<i>however disposed&nbsp;</i>because<br>it is so placed, thus:&nbsp;<i>In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire<br>element, and the air element</i>.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:363;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4036">30.&nbsp;What is meant? Just as the butcher, while feeding the cow,&nbsp;bringing it to the<br>shambles, keeping it tied up after bringing it there, slaughtering it, and seeing it<br>slaughtered and dead, does not lose the perception “cow” so long as he has not<br>carved it up and divided it into parts; but when he has divided it up and is<br>sitting there, he loses the perception “cow” and the perception “meat” occurs;<br>he does not think “I am selling cow” or “They are carrying cow away,” but rather<br>he thinks “I am selling meat” or “They are carrying meat away”; so too this<br>bhikkhu, while still a foolish ordinary person—both formerly as a layman and<br>as one gone forth into homelessness—does not lose the perception “living being”<br>or “man” or “person” so long as he does not, by resolution of the compact into<br>elements, review this body, however placed, however disposed, as consisting of<br>elements. But when he does review it as consisting of elements, he loses the<br>perception “living being” and his mind establishes itself upon elements. That&nbsp;is<br>why the Blessed One said: “Bhikkhus, just as though a skilled butcher&nbsp;<i>…</i>&nbsp;were<br>seated at&nbsp;the crossroads&nbsp;<i>…</i>&nbsp;so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu&nbsp;<i>…</i>&nbsp;air element.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:688;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4038">20.&nbsp;“Herein, as regards&nbsp;<i>‘earth element,’&nbsp;</i>etc., the meaning of element is the meaning of<br>individual essence, the meaning of individual essence is the meaning of voidness, the<br>meaning of voidness is the meaning of not-a-living-being. So it is just earth in the<br>sense of individual essence, voidness and not-a-living-being that is the element; hence<br>it is earth element; so too in the case of the water element, and the rest. The earth<br>element is the element that is the foothold for the conascent material states. Likewise<br>the water element is the element of their cohesion; the fire element is the element of<br>their ripening; and the air element is the element of their conveyance and distension”<br>(Vism-mhṭ 345).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:833;left:18"><nobr><span class="ft4034">To avoid confusion, it might be mentioned here that in “physical” earth, fire, water,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:850;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4038">and air, it would be held that all four elements are present in each equally, but that in<br>“physical” earth the earth element is dominant in efficacy as the mode of hardness;<br>and correspondingly with water and the rest.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:237;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4066">39.&nbsp;As regards the method of development here, however,&nbsp;to discern the elements<br>in detail in this way,&nbsp;“The head hairs are the earth element, the body hairs are the<br>earth element,” appears redundant to a bhikkhu of quick understanding, though<br>the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in this<br>way: “What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element, what&nbsp;has<br>the characteristic of cohesion is the water element, what&nbsp;has the characteristic of<br>ripening (maturing) is the fire element, what&nbsp;has the characteristic of distending<br>(supporting) is the air element.” But when one of not over-quick understanding<br>gives his attention to it in this way,&nbsp;it appears obscure and unevident, and it only<br>becomes plain to him if he gives his attention to it in the first-mentioned way.&nbsp;Why?</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:415;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4066">40.&nbsp;Suppose two bhikkhus&nbsp;are reciting a text with many elided repetitions, then<br>the bhikkhu with the quicker understanding fills out the elided repetitions once<br>or twice, after which he goes on doing the recital with only the two end parts of<br>the elisions. Here the one of less quick understanding says,&nbsp;“What is he reciting?<br>Why, he does not even give&nbsp;one time to move&nbsp;one’s lips! If the recitation is done<br>like this, when shall we&nbsp;ever get familiar with the text?” and so he does his<br>recitation filling out each elision as it comes. Then the other says,&nbsp;“What is he<br>reciting? Why, he never lets one get to the end of it! If the recitation is done like<br>this; when shall we&nbsp;ever get to the end of it?” So too, the detailed discerning of<br>the elements by&nbsp;head hairs, etc., appears redundant to one of quick<br>understanding, though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives<br>his attention to it in brief in this way,&nbsp;“What has the characteristic of stiffenedness<br>is the earth element,” and so on. But when the other gives his attention to it in<br>this way,&nbsp;it appears obscure and unevident, and it only becomes plain to him if<br>he gives his attention in detail by&nbsp;head hairs and so on.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:681;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4066">41.&nbsp;So firstly, one of quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation<br>subject should go into solitary retreat. Then he should advert to his own entire<br>material body and discern the elements in brief in this way: “In this body what<br>is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element, what&nbsp;is cohesion or fluidity25<br>[352] is the water element, what&nbsp;is maturing (ripening) or heat is the fire element,<br>what&nbsp;is distension or movement is the air element.” And he should advert and<br>give&nbsp;attention to it and review it again and again as “earth element, water<br>element,” that is to say,&nbsp;as mere elements, not a living being, and soulless.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:825;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4066">42.&nbsp;As he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in<br>him, which is reinforced by&nbsp;understanding that illuminates the classification of</span></nobr></DIV>

And he should resolve each of these [as a<br>separate entity], separating them out by&nbsp;the hand of knowledge, and then discern<br>them in the way already stated thus: “In these what&nbsp;is stiffenedness or harshness<br>is the earth element.” And he should again and again advert to them, give<br>attention to them and review them as mere elements, not a living being, not a<br>soul.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:450;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4073">45.&nbsp;The method given in detail should be understood in this way.&nbsp;A meditator<br>of not over-quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject<br>should learn the elements in detail in the forty-two aspects from a teacher, and<br>he should live&nbsp;in an abode of the kind already described. Then, when he has<br>done all the duties, he should go into solitary retreat&nbsp;and develop the meditation<br>subject in four ways thus: (1) with constituents in brief, (2) with constituents by<br>analysis, (3) with characteristics in brief, and (4) with characteristics by&nbsp;analysis.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:585;left:67"><nobr><span class="ft4070">[(1) WITH&nbsp;CONSTITUENTS&nbsp;IN&nbsp;BRIEF]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:607;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4073">46.&nbsp;Herein, how does he develop it&nbsp;<i>with constituents in brief</i>? Here a bhikkhu<br>does his defining in this way,&nbsp;“In twenty of the parts what&nbsp;has the stiffened mode<br>is the earth element,” and he does his defining thus, “In twelve parts the liquid<br>called water with the mode of cohesion is the water element,” [353] and he does<br>his defining thus, “In four parts what&nbsp;matures (what has the mode of ripening)<br>is the fire element,” and he does his defining thus, “In six parts what&nbsp;has the<br>mode of distending is the air element.” As he defines them in this way they<br>become evident to him. As he again and again adverts to them and gives his<br>attention to them, concentration arises as access only.</span></nobr></DIV>

How? Firstly, the<br>bhikkhu should carry out all the directions given for the thirty-two-fold aspect<br>in the description of mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject<br>(VIII.48–78), namely, the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving</span></nobr></DIV>

And if they were found outside each other,<br>they would be already resolved (separate), and that&nbsp;being so, any description of them<br>as unresolved (inseparable) would be meaningless.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:393;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4256">was also asked, however (III.1). Herein, the benefits of the development of<br>concentration are fivefold, as a blissful abiding here and now,&nbsp;and so on. For the<br>development of absorption concentration provides the benefit of a blissful abiding<br>here and now for the Arahants with cankers destroyed who develop<br>concentration, thinking, “We shall attain and dwell with unified mind for a<br>whole day.” Hence the Blessed One said: “But, Cunda, it is not these that are<br>called effacement in the Noble Ones’ discipline; these are called blissful abidings<br>in the Noble Ones’ discipline” (M I 40).</span></nobr></DIV>
