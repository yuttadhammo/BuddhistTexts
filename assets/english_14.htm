<DIV style="position:absolute;top:335;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4588">1.&nbsp;[407] It is now the turn for the description of the divine ear element. Herein,<br>and also in the case of the remaining three kinds of direct-knowledge, the<br>meaning of the passage beginning, “When his concentrated mind …” (D I 79)<br>should be understood in the way already stated (XII.13f.); and in each case we<br>shall only comment on what&nbsp;is different. [The text is as follows: “He directs, he<br>inclines, his mind to the divine ear element. With the divine ear element, which<br>is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine<br>and the human, those that are far as well as near”(D I 79).]</span></nobr></DIV>

And this ear element consisting in knowledge,<br>which is produced by&nbsp;the power of this bhikkhu’s energy in development, is<br>similar to that, so it is “divine” because it is similar to the divine. Furthermore, it<br>is “divine” because it is obtained by means of divine abiding and because it has<br>divine abiding as its support. And it is an “ear element” (<i>sota-dhātu</i>) in the sense<br>of hearing (<i>savana</i>) and in the sense of being a soulless [element]. Also it is an<br>“ear element” because it is like the ear element in its performance of an ear<br>element’s function. With that divine ear element … he hears …</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:324;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4603">8.&nbsp;As to the explanation of knowledge of penetration of minds, [the text is as<br>follows: “He directs, he inclines, his mind to the knowledge of penetration of<br>minds. He penetrates with his mind the minds of other beings, of other persons,<br>and understands them thus: he understands [the manner of] consciousness<br>affected by greed as affected by greed, and understands [the manner of]<br>consciousness unaffected by greed as unaffected by greed; he understands<br>consciousness affected by&nbsp;hate as affected by&nbsp;hate, and consciousness unaffected<br>by&nbsp;hate as unaffected by&nbsp;hate; he understands consciousness affected by&nbsp;delusion<br>as affected by delusion, and consciousness unaffected by delusion as unaffected<br>by delusion; he understands cramped consciousness as cramped, and distracted<br>consciousness as distracted; he understands exalted consciousness as exalted,<br>and unexalted consciousness as unexalted; he understands surpassed<br>consciousness as surpassed and unsurpassed consciousness as unsurpassed;<br>he understands concentrated consciousness as concentrated and unconcentrated<br>consciousness as unconcentrated; he understands the liberated [manner of]<br>consciousness as liberated, and the unliberated [manner of] consciousness as<br>unliberated” (D I 79). Here, it goes all round (<i>pariyāti</i>), thus it is penetration<br>(<i>pariya</i>); the meaning is that it delimits (<i>paricchindati</i>). The penetration of the<br>heart (<i>cetaso pariyaṃ</i>) is “penetration of minds” (<i>cetopariya</i>). It is penetration of<br>hearts and that is knowledge, thus it is knowledge of penetration of minds<br>(<i>cetopariyañāṇa</i>). [He directs his consciousness] to that, is what&nbsp;is meant.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:219;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4636">15.&nbsp;There are six kinds of people who recollect these past lives.&nbsp;They are: other<br>sectarians, ordinary disciples, great disciples, chief disciples, Paccekabuddhas,<br>and Buddhas.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:276;left:33"><nobr><span class="ft4630">Herein, other sectarians recollect only as far back as forty eons, but not</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:293;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4636">beyond that. Why? Because their understanding is weak for lack of delimitation<br>of mind and matter (see Ch. XVIII). Ordinary disciples recollect as far back as a<br>hundred eons and as far back as a thousand eons because their understanding<br>is strong. The eighty great disciples recollect as far back as a hundred thousand<br>eons. The two chief disciples recollect as far back as an incalculable age and a<br>hundred thousand eons. Paccekabuddhas recollect as far back as two incalculable<br>ages and a hundred thousand eons.&nbsp;For such is the extent to which they&nbsp;can<br>convey [their minds back respectively]. But there is no limit in the case of Buddhas.</span></nobr></DIV>

They are like the blind in that they are unable to<br>descend upon any place they choose; they go as the blind do without letting go<br>of their sticks. So they recollect without letting go of the succession of aggregates.<br>Ordinary disciples both recollect by&nbsp;means of the succession of aggregates and<br>trace by&nbsp;means of death and rebirth-linking. Likewise, the eighty great disciples.<br>But the chief disciples have&nbsp;nothing to do with the succession of aggregates.<br>When they see the death of one person, they see the rebirth-linking, and again<br>when they see the death of another, they see the rebirth-linking.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:633;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4636">18.&nbsp;Buddhas, however,&nbsp;have&nbsp;nothing to do either with succession of aggregates<br>or with tracing through death and rebirth-linking; for whatever instance they<br>choose in many millions of eons, or more or less, is evident to them.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:127;left:23"><nobr><span class="ft4640">Among these beings with recollection of past lives,&nbsp;the sectarians’ vision</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:145;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4646">of past lives seems like the light of a glow-worm, that of ordinary disciples like<br>the light of a candle, that of the great disciples like the light of a torch, that of the<br>chief disciples like the light of the morning star, that of Paccekabuddhas like the<br>light of the moon, and that of Buddhas like the glorious autumn sun’s disk with<br>its thousand rays.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:236;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4646">20.&nbsp;Other sectarians see past lives as blind men go [tapping] with the point of<br>a stick. Ordinary disciples do so as men who go on a log bridge. The great<br>disciples do so as men who go on a foot bridge. The chief disciples do so as men<br>who go on a cart bridge. Paccekabuddhas do so as men who go on a main foot-<br>path. And Buddhas do so as men who go on a high road for carts.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:328;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4646">21.&nbsp;In this connection it is the disciples’ recollection of past lives that is intended.<br>Hence it was said above: “‘He recollects’: he recollects it following it out by&nbsp;the<br>succession of aggregates, or by&nbsp;death and rebirth-linking” (§14).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:384;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4646">22.&nbsp;So a bhikkhu who is a beginner and wants to recollect in this way should<br>go into solitary retreat on return from his alms round after his meal. Then he<br>should attain the four jhānas in succession and emerge from the fourth jhāna as<br>basis for direct-knowledge. He should then advert to his most recent act of<br>sitting down [for this purpose], next, to the preparation of the seat, to the entry<br>into the lodging, to the putting away&nbsp;of the bowl and [outer] robe, to the time of<br>eating, to the time of returning from the village, to the time of wandering for alms<br>in the village, to the time of entering the village, to the time of setting out from the<br>monastery, to the time of paying homage at&nbsp;the shrine terrace and the<br>Enlightenment-tree terrace, to the time of washing the bowl, to the time of picking<br>up the bowl, to the things done from the time of picking up the bowl back to the<br>mouth washing, to the things done in the early morning, to the things done in<br>the middle watch, in the first watch. In this way he should advert to all the things<br>done during the whole night and day in reverse order.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:633;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4646">23.&nbsp;While this much, however,&nbsp;is evident even to his normal consciousness, it is<br>especially evident to his preliminary-work consciousness. But if anything there<br>is not evident, he should again attain the basic jhāna, emerge and advert. By so<br>doing it becomes as evident as when a lamp is lit. And so, in reverse order too, he<br>should advert to the things done on the second day back, and on the third,<br>fourth and fifth day,&nbsp;and in the ten days, and in the fortnight, and as far back as<br>a year.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:759;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4646">24.&nbsp;When by&nbsp;these means he adverts to ten years, twenty years, and so on as far<br>back as his own rebirth-linking in this existence, [413] he should advert to the<br>mentality-materiality occurring at&nbsp;the moment of death in the preceding existence;<br>for a wise bhikkhu is able at&nbsp;the first attempt to remove10&nbsp;the rebirth-linking and<br>make the mentality-materiality at&nbsp;the death moment his object.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:537;left:18"><nobr><span class="ft4650">However,&nbsp;when this bhikkhu has got back beyond the rebirth-linking, there</span></nobr></DIV>

The last is a fine-material absorption consciousness of the fourth jhāna.<br>The knowledge that arises in him then together with that consciousness is what<br>is called, “knowledge of recollection of past lives.” It is with the mindfulness<br>(memory) associated with that knowledge that he “recollects his manifold past<br>lives,&nbsp;that is to say,&nbsp;one birth, two births, …”[414] thus with details and particulars<br>he recollects his manifold past lives (D I 81).</span></nobr></DIV>

When it contracts<br>owing to air, it is all demolished by&nbsp;wind up to the Vehapphala [Brahmā-world].</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:288;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4663">31.&nbsp;In breadth it is always one of the Buddha-fields that is destroyed. For the<br>Buddha-fields are of three kinds, that is, the field of birth, the field of authority,<br>and the field of scope.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:345;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft4660">Herein, the field of birth is limited by&nbsp;the ten thousand world-spheres that</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:363;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4663">quaked on the Perfect One’s taking rebirth-linking, and so on. The field of<br>authority is limited by&nbsp;the hundred thousand million world-spheres where the<br>following safeguards (<i>paritta</i>) are efficacious, that is, the Ratana Sutta (Sn p.39),<br>the Khandha Paritta (Vin II 109; A II 72), the Dhajagga Paritta (S I 218), the<br>Áṭānāṭiya Paritta (D III 194), and the Mora Paritta (J-a II 33). The field of scope is<br>boundless, immeasurable: “As far as he wishes” (A I 228), it is said. The Perfect<br>One knows anything anywhere that he wishes. So one of these three Buddha-<br>fields, that is to say,&nbsp;the field of authority is destroyed. But when that is being<br>destroyed, the field of birth also gets destroyed. And that happens simultaneously;<br>and when it is reconstituted, that happens simultaneously (cf. M-a IV 114).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:541;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4663">32.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;it should be understood how its destruction and reconstitution come<br>about thus. On the occasion when the aeon is destroyed by&nbsp;fire [415] first of all a<br>great cloud heralding the aeon’s destruction appears, and there is a great<br>downpour all over the hundred thousand million world-spheres. People are<br>delighted, and they bring out all their seeds and sow them. But when the sprouts<br>have&nbsp;grown enough for an ox&nbsp;to graze, then not a drop of rain falls any more<br>even when the asses bray. Rain is withheld from then on. This is what&nbsp;the<br>Blessed One referred to when he said: “Bhikkhus, an occasion comes when for<br>many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many<br>hundreds of thousands of years, there is no rain” (A IV 100). Beings that live&nbsp;by<br>rain die and are reborn in the Brahmā-world, and so are the deities that live&nbsp;on<br>flowers and fruits.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:754;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4663">33.&nbsp;When a long period has passed in this way,&nbsp;the water gives out here and<br>there. Then in due course the fishes and turtles die and are reborn in the Brahmā-<br>world, and so are the beings in hell. Some say that&nbsp;the denizens of hell perish<br>there with the appearance of the seventh sun (§41).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:828;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft4660">Now,&nbsp;there is no rebirth in the Brahmā-world without jhāna; and some of</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:846;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4663">them, being obsessed with the scarcity of food, are unable to attain jhāna, so how<br>are they reborn there? By means of jhāna obtained in the [sense-sphere] divine<br>world.</span></nobr></DIV>

He gives it attention<br>in this way,&nbsp;“After doing what&nbsp;deeds do these beings undergo this suffering?”<br>Then knowledge that has those deeds as its object arises in him in this way,&nbsp;“It<br>was after doing this.” Likewise he extends light upwards in the direction of the<br>[sensual-sphere] divine world, and he sees beings in the Nandana Grove,&nbsp;the<br>Missaka Grove,&nbsp;the Phārusaka Grove,&nbsp;etc., enjoying great good fortune.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4763">and when they say,&nbsp;“They have&nbsp;no jhāna or liberation or path of fruition, etc.,”<br>they revile them with denial of their special qualities. And whether done<br>knowingly or unknowingly it is in either case reviling of Noble Ones; it is weighty<br>kamma resembling that of immediate result, and it is an obstacle both to heaven<br>and to the path. But it is remediable.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4763">84.&nbsp;The following story should be understood in order to make this clear. An<br>elder and a young bhikkhu, it seems, wandered for alms in a certain village. At<br>the first house they got only a spoonful of hot gruel. The elder’s stomach was<br>paining him with wind. He thought, “This gruel is good for me; I shall drink it<br>before it gets cold.” People brought a wooden stool to the doorstep, and he sat<br>down and drank it. The other was disgusted and remarked, “The old man has<br>let his hunger get the better of him and has done what&nbsp;he should be ashamed to<br>do.” The elder wandered for alms, and on returning to the monastery he asked<br>the young bhikkhu, “Have&nbsp;you any footing in this Dispensation, friend?”—<br>“Yes, venerable sir, I am a stream-enterer.”—“Then, friend, do not try for the<br>higher paths; one whose cankers are destroyed has been reviled by&nbsp;you.” The<br>young bhikkhu asked for the elder’s forgiveness and was thereby restored to his<br>former state.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:410;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4763">85.&nbsp;So one who reviles a Noble One, even if he is one himself, should go to him;<br>if he himself is senior, [426] he should sit down in the squatting position and get<br>his forgiveness in this way,&nbsp;“I have&nbsp;said such and such to the venerable one; may<br>he forgive&nbsp;me.” If he himself is junior, he should pay homage, and sitting in the<br>squatting position and holding out his hand palms together, he should get his<br>forgiveness in this way,&nbsp;“I have&nbsp;said such and such to you, venerable sir; forgive<br>me.” If the other has gone away, he should get his forgiveness either by&nbsp;going to<br>him himself or by sending someone such as a co-resident.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:554;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4763">86.&nbsp;If he can neither go nor send, he should go to the bhikkhus who live&nbsp;in that<br>monastery, and, sitting down in the squatting position if they are junior, or<br>acting in the way already described if they are senior, he should get forgiveness<br>by&nbsp;saying, “Venerable sirs, I have&nbsp;said such and such to the venerable one named<br>so and so; may that venerable one forgive&nbsp;me.” And this should also be done<br>when he fails to get forgiveness in his presence.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:663;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4763">87.&nbsp;If it is a bhikkhu who wanders alone and it cannot be discovered where he<br>is living or where he has gone, he should go to a wise bhikkhu and say,&nbsp;“Venerable<br>sir, I have&nbsp;said such and such to the venerable one named so and so. When I<br>remember it, I am remorseful. What shall I do?” He should be told, “Think no<br>more about it; the elder forgives you. Set your mind at&nbsp;rest.” Then he should<br>extend his hands palms together in the direction taken by&nbsp;the Noble One and<br>say,&nbsp;“Forgive&nbsp;me.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:789;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4763">88.&nbsp;If the Noble One has attained the final Nibbāna, he should go to the place<br>where the bed is, on which he attained the final Nibbāna, and should go as far<br>as the charnel ground to ask forgiveness. When this has been done, there is no<br>obstruction either to heaven or to the path. He becomes as he was before.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:197;left:0"><nobr><span class="ft4776">90.&nbsp;Reviling Noble Ones is greatly reprehensible because of its resemblance to<br>kamma with immediate result. For this is said: “Sāriputta, just as a bhikkhu<br>possessing virtuous conduct, concentration and understanding could here and<br>now attain final knowledge, so it is in this case, I say; if he does not abandon<br>such talk and such thoughts and renounce such views, he will find himself in<br>hell as surely as if he had been carried off and put there” (M I 71).18&nbsp;[427] And<br>there is nothing more reprehensible than wrong view,&nbsp;according as it is said:<br>“Bhikkhus, I do not see any one thing so reprehensible as wrong view” (A I 33).</span></nobr></DIV>

The destiny (<i>gati</i>, going), the refuge, of<br>suffering (<i>dukkha</i>) is the&nbsp;<i>unhappy destiny</i>&nbsp;(<i>duggati</i>); or the destiny (<i>gati</i>) produced<br>by&nbsp;kamma that is corrupted (<i>duṭṭha</i>) by&nbsp;much hate (<i>dosa</i>) is an&nbsp;<i>unhappy destiny<br></i>(<i>duggati</i>).

The realm of ghosts is<br>indicated by&nbsp;the mention of the&nbsp;<i>unhappy destiny</i>; for that is both a state of loss and<br>an unhappy destiny because it is removed from the happy destiny and because<br>it is the destiny of suffering; but it is not perdition because it is not a state of<br>perdition such as that of the asura demons. The race of asura demons is indicated<br>by&nbsp;the mention of&nbsp;<i>perdition</i>; for that is both a state of loss and an unhappy<br>destiny in the way already described, and it is called “perdition” (deprivation)<br>from all opportunities.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:110;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4783">94.&nbsp;The bright side should be understood in the opposite way.&nbsp;But there is this<br>difference. Here the mention of the happy destiny includes the human destiny,<br>and only the divine destiny is included by&nbsp;the mention of&nbsp;<i>heavenly</i>. Herein, a<br>good (<i>sundara</i>) destiny (<i>gati</i>) is a&nbsp;<i>happy destiny</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>sugati</i>). It is the very highest<br>(<i>suṭṭhu aggo</i>) in such things as the objective&nbsp;fields comprising visible objects, etc.,<br>thus it is&nbsp;<i>heavenly</i>&nbsp;(<i>sagga</i>). All that is a world (<i>loka</i>) in the sense of crumbling and<br>disintegrating (<i>lujjana-palujjana</i>). This is the word meaning.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:236;left:9"><nobr><span class="ft4782"><i>Thus with the divine eye</i>, etc., is all a summing-up phrase; the meaning here in</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4780">brief is this: so with the divine eye … he sees.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:276;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4780">95.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:276;left:23"><nobr><span class="ft4780">Now,&nbsp;a clansman who is a beginner and wants to see in this way should</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:293;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4783">make sure that the jhāna, which has a kasiṇa as its object and is the basis for<br>direct-knowledge, is made in all ways susceptible of his guidance. Then one of<br>these three kasiṇas, that is to say,&nbsp;the fire kasiṇa, white kasiṇa, [428] or light<br>kasiṇa, should be brought to the neighbourhood [of the arising of divine-eye<br>knowledge]. He should make this access jhāna his resort and stop there to<br>extend [the kasiṇa]; the intention is that absorption should not be aroused here;<br>for if he does induce absorption, the [kasiṇa] will become the support for basic<br>jhāna, but not for the [direct-knowledge] preliminary work. The light kasiṇa is<br>the best of the three. So either that, or one of the others, should be worked up in<br>the way stated in the Description of the Kasiṇas, and it should be stopped at&nbsp;the<br>level of access and extended there. And the method for extending it should be<br>understood in the way already described there too. It is only what&nbsp;is visible<br>within the area to which the kasiṇa has been extended that can be seen.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:524;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4780">96.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:524;left:24"><nobr><span class="ft4780">However,&nbsp;while he is seeing what&nbsp;is visible, the turn of the preliminary</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:541;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4783">work&nbsp;runs out. Thereupon the light disappears. When that has disappeared, he<br>no longer sees what&nbsp;is visible (cf. M III 158). Then he should again and again<br>attain the basic jhāna, emerge and pervade with light. In this way the light<br>gradually gets consolidated till at&nbsp;length it remains in whatever sized area has<br>been delimited by&nbsp;him in this way,&nbsp;“Let there be light here.” Even if he sits<br>watching all day he can still see visible objects.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:650;left:-9"><nobr><span class="ft4783">97.&nbsp;And here there is the simile of the man who set out on a journey by night<br>with a grass torch. Someone set out on a journey by&nbsp;night, it seems, with a grass<br>torch. His torch stopped flaming. Then the even and uneven places were no<br>more evident to him. He stubbed the torch on the ground and it again blazed up.<br>In doing so it gave&nbsp;more light than before. As it went on dying out and flaring up<br>again, eventually the sun rose.
