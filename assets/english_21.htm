<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft6944">external, (vi–vii) gross or subtle, (viii–ix) inferior or superior, (x-xi) far or near—<br>he defines all materiality as impermanent: this is one kind of comprehension.<br>He defines it as painful: [610] this is one kind of comprehension. He defines it as<br>not-self: this is one kind of comprehension” (see §6). At&nbsp;this point this bhikkhu<br>[takes] all materiality, which is described without specifying as “<i>any materiality<br>whatever</i>,” and having delimited it in the eleven instances, namely, with the past<br>triad and with the four dyads beginning with the internal dyad, he “<i>defines all<br>materiality as impermanent</i>,” he comprehends that it is impermanent. How? In the<br>way stated next. For this is said: “<i>Materiality, whether past, future or present, is<br>impermanent in the sense of destruction</i>.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:267;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft6940">14.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:267;left:95"><nobr><span class="ft6940">Accordingly, he comprehends the materiality that is past as “<i>impermanent</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:284;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft6943"><i>in the sense of destruction</i>”<i>&nbsp;</i>because it was destroyed in the past and did not reach<br>this becoming; and he comprehends the materiality that is future as “<i>impermanent<br>in the sense of destruction</i>”<i>&nbsp;</i>since it will be produced in the next becoming, will be<br>destroyed there too, and will not pass on to a further becoming; and he<br>comprehends the materiality that is present as “<i>impermanent in the sense of<br>destruction</i>”<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>since it is destroyed here and does not pass beyond. And he<br>comprehends the materiality that is internal as “<i>impermanent in the sense of<br>destruction</i>” since it is destroyed as internal and does not pass on to the external<br>state. And he comprehends the materiality that is external …&nbsp;gross … subtle …<br>inferior … superior … far … And he comprehends the materiality that is near as<br>“<i>impermanent in the sense of destruction</i>” since it is destroyed there and does not pass<br>on to the far state. And all this is impermanent in the sense of destruction. Accordingly,<br>there is “<i>one kind of comprehension</i>”<i>&nbsp;</i>in this way; but it is effected in eleven ways.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:515;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft6943">15.&nbsp;And all that [materiality] is “<i>painful in the sense of terror</i>.” In the sense of<br>terror because of its terrifyingness; for what&nbsp;is impermanent brings terror, as it<br>does to the deities in the Sīhopama Sutta (S III 84). So this is also painful in the<br>sense of terror. Accordingly, there is one kind of comprehension in this way too;<br>but it is effected in eleven ways.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:606;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft6943">16.&nbsp;And just as it is painful, so too all that [materiality] is “<i>not-self in the sense of<br>having no core</i>.” In the sense of having no core because of the absence of any core<br>of self conceived as a self, an abider, a doer, an experiencer, one who is his own<br>master; for what&nbsp;is impermanent is painful (S III 82), and it is impossible to<br>escape the impermanence, or the rise and fall and oppression, of self, so how<br>could it have&nbsp;the state of a doer, and so on? Hence it is said, “Bhikkhus, were<br>materiality self, it would not lead to affliction” (S III 66), and so on. So this is also<br>not-self in the sense of having no core. Accordingly, there is one kind of<br>comprehension in this way too, but it is effected in eleven ways. [611] The same<br>method applies to feeling, and so on.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:785;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft6943">17.&nbsp;But what&nbsp;is impermanent is necessarily classed as formed, etc., and so in<br>order to show the synonyms for that [impermanence], or in order to show how<br>the attention given to it occurs in different ways, it is restated in the text thus:<br>“Materiality, whether past, future, or present, is impermanent, formed,<br>dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away,<br>subject to cessation” (§7). The same method applies to feeling, and so on.</span></nobr></DIV>

And then (1) the contemplation of impermanence and (11) the<br>contemplation of the signless are one in meaning and different only in the letter,<br>and so are (2) the contemplation of pain and (12) the contemplation of the<br>desireless, and so are (3) the contemplation of not-self and (13) the contemplation<br>of voidness (see Paṭis II 63). Consequently these have&nbsp;been penetrated by&nbsp;him as<br>well. But (14) insight into states that is higher understanding is all kinds of<br>insight, and (15) correct knowledge and vision is included in purification by<br>overcoming doubt (Ch. XIX). Consequently, these two have&nbsp;been penetrated by<br>him as well. As to the remaining kinds of insight, some have&nbsp;been penetrated<br>and some not.

(11)–(13) The three<br>beginning with ‘<i>contemplation of the signless</i>’ are the same as the three beginning with<br>contemplation of impermanence. (11) ‘<i>The sign</i>’ is the mere appearance of formations<br>as if graspable entities, which is due to the individualization of particular functions<br>and which, owing to perception of unity in continuity and in mass, is assumed to be<br>temporarily enduring or permanent. (12) ‘<i>Desire</i>’ is longing for pleasure, or it is desire<br>consisting in greed, and so on; it means inclinationto formations owing to craving.<br>(13) ‘<i>Misinterpreting</i>’ is misinterpreting as self. It is owing to their opposing the ‘<i>sign</i>,’<br>etc., that the contemplations of impermanence, etc., are called by&nbsp;the names of ‘signless,’<br>etc.; so they should be regarded as opposed to the apprehension of a sign, etc., just as<br>they are to the perception of permanence, and so on. (14) Insight that occurs by<br>knowing an object consisting of a visible datum, etc., and by&nbsp;seeing the dissolution of<br>the consciousness that had that visible datum, etc., as its object, and by&nbsp;apprehending<br>voidness through the dissolution thus, ‘Only formations dissolve,&nbsp;there is nothing<br>beyond the death of formations,’ is the higher understanding, and that is insight into<br>states, thus it is ‘<i>insight into states that is higher understanding</i>’; by&nbsp;its means he abandons<br>the view accompanied by&nbsp;craving that is the misinterpretation occurring as grasping<br>at&nbsp;a permanent core, and so on. (15) ‘<i>Correct knowledge and vision</i>’ is a term for the<br>seeing of mentality-materiality with its conditions; by&nbsp;its means he abandons the<br>‘<i>misinterpreting due to confusion</i>’ that begins thus, ‘Was I in the past?’ (M I 8) and that<br>begins thus, ‘Thus the world is created by&nbsp;an Overlord’ (?). (16) The knowledge<br>consisting in the seeing of danger in all kinds of becomings, etc., which has arisen<br>owing to the appearance of terror is ‘<i>contemplation of danger</i>’; by&nbsp;its means he abandons<br>the craving occurring as ‘<i>misinterpreting due to reliance</i>’ because he does not see any<br>reliance or support. (17) The knowledge of reflection that is the means to deliverance<br>from formations is ‘<i>contemplation of reflection</i>’; by&nbsp;its means he abandons the ignorance<br>that is ‘<i>non-reflection</i>’ on impermanence, etc., and is opposed to reflection on them.<br>(18) Equanimity about formations and conformity knowledge are ‘<i>contemplation of<br>turning away</i>’; for owing to it the mind retreats and recoils from all formations, like a<br>water drop on a lotus leaf, so by&nbsp;its means he abandons the ‘<i>misinterpretation due to<br>bondage</i>,’ which is the occurrence of the defilements consisting of the fetters of sense<br>desire, and so on.

But that is hard to discern at&nbsp;the start, so the interpreting<br>by insight should be done by means of presence according to continuity” (Vism-mhṭ<br>808). For the elision represented by&nbsp;“… (etc.) …” see XX.9. In this case, however,&nbsp;the<br>last two members of the dependent origination are left out. “Although states<br>possessed of aging-and-death are mentioned under the heading of birth and of aging-<br>and-death in comprehension by&nbsp;groups, etc., nevertheless here in the description of<br>knowledge of rise and fall, if it were said ‘present birth is born; the characteristic of its<br>generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is fall,’ etc., it would be tantamount to<br>an affirmation and approval of the proposition that birth and aging-and-death were<br>possessed of birth and of aging-and-death. So the text ends with ‘becoming’ in order<br>to avoid that” (Vism-mhṭ 808).</span></nobr></DIV>

In this connection Vism-<br>mhṭ quotes the following text: “Friends, any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī who declares the<br>attainment of Arahantship in my presence has always arrived there by&nbsp;four paths or<br>by&nbsp;one of them. What four? Here, friends, a bhikkhu develops insight preceded by<br>serenity. While he is developing insight preceded by&nbsp;serenity the path is born in him.<br>He cultivates, develops, repeats that path. As he does so his fetters are abandoned and<br>his inherent tendencies are brought to an end. Again, friends, a bhikkhu develops<br>serenity preceded by&nbsp;insight … He develops serenity and insight yoked equally. Again,<br>friends, a bhikkhu’s mind is seized by&nbsp;agitation about highest states. When that<br>consciousness settles down internally, becomes steady, unified and concentrated,<br>then the path is born in him … his inherent tendencies are brought to an end” (A II<br>157).<br>34.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:801;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft7194">“‘<i>Illumination due to insight</i>’ is the luminous materiality originated by&nbsp;insight</span></nobr></DIV>

The other kind is independent of his body and spreads all round<br>over what&nbsp;is capable of being experienced by&nbsp;knowledge.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:236;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft7200">This story illustrates how it varies. Two elders, it seems, were sitting inside</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7206">a room with a double wall at&nbsp;Cittalapabbata. It was the Uposatha of the dark of<br>the moon that day.&nbsp;All directions were covered by&nbsp;a blanket of cloud, and at&nbsp;night<br>the four-factored gloom35&nbsp;prevailed. Then one elder said, “Venerable sir, the<br>flowers of the five&nbsp;colours on the lion table on the shrine terrace are visible to me<br>now.” The other said, “What you say is nothing wonderful, friend. Actually the<br>fishes and turtles in the ocean a league away&nbsp;are visible to me now.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:363;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7206">110.&nbsp;This imperfection of insight usually arises in one who has acquired serenity<br>and insight. Because the defilements suppressed by&nbsp;the attainments do not manifest<br>themselves, he thinks, “I am an Arahant,” like the Elder Mahā-Nāga who lived at<br>Uccavālika, like the Elder Mahā-Datta who lived at&nbsp;Haṅkana, like the Elder Cūḷa-<br>Sumana who lived in the Nikapenna meditation house at&nbsp;Cittalapabbata.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:454;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7206">111.&nbsp;Here is one story as an illustration. The Elder Dhammadinna, it seems, who<br>lived at&nbsp;Talaṅgara—one of the great ones with cankers destroyed who possessed<br>the categories of discrimination—was the instructor of a large community of<br>bhikkhus. One day,&nbsp;as he was sitting in his own daytime quarters, he wondered,<br>“Has our teacher, the Elder Mahā-Nāga who lives at&nbsp;Uccavālika, [635] brought his<br>work&nbsp;of asceticism to its conclusion, or not?” He saw that he was still an ordinary<br>man, and he knew that if he did not go to him, he would die an ordinary man. He<br>rose up into the air with supernormal power and alighted near the elder, who was<br>sitting in his daytime quarters. He paid homage to him, doing his duty, and sat<br>down at&nbsp;one side. To the question, “Why have&nbsp;you come unexpectedly, friend<br>Dhammadinna?” he replied, “I have&nbsp;come to ask a question, venerable sir.” He was<br>told, “Ask, friend. If we&nbsp;know,&nbsp;we&nbsp;shall say.” He asked a thousand questions.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:667;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7206">112.&nbsp;The elder replied without hesitation to each question. To the remark, “Your<br>knowledge is very keen, venerable sir; when was this state attained by&nbsp;you?” he<br>replied, “Sixty years ago, friend.” “Do you practice concentration, venerable sir?”—<br>“That is not difficult, friend.”—“Then make an elephant, venerable sir.” The elder<br>made an elephant all white. “Now,&nbsp;venerable sir, make that elephant come straight<br>at&nbsp;you with his ears outstretched, his tail extended, putting his trunk in his mouth<br>and making a horrible trumpeting.” The elder did so.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:53;left:388"><nobr><span class="ft7222"><i>Part 3: Understanding (Paññā)</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:81;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7227">121.&nbsp;<i>9. Equanimity&nbsp;</i>is both equanimity about insight and equanimity in adverting.37<br>For equanimity about insight, which is neutrality about formations, arises strongly<br>in him at&nbsp;that time. It is also equanimity in adverting in the mind door. For whatever<br>the subject he adverts to, his adverting works as incisively and sharply as a lightning<br>flash, like a red-hot spear plunged into a basket of leaves.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:172;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7227">122.&nbsp;10.&nbsp;<i>Attachment&nbsp;</i>is attachment due to insight. For when his insight is adorned<br>with illumination, etc., attachment arises in him, which is subtle and peaceful in<br>aspect, and it relies on (clings to) that insight; and he is not able to discern that<br>attachment as a defilement. [637]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:246;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7227">123.&nbsp;And as in the case of illumination, so too in the case of the other imperfections<br>that may arise, the meditator thinks thus: “Such knowledge … such rapturous<br>happiness … tranquillity … bliss … resolution … exertion … assurance …<br>equanimity … attachment never arose in me before. I have&nbsp;surely reached the path,<br>reached fruition.” Thus he takes what&nbsp;is not the path to be the path and what&nbsp;is not<br>fruition to be fruition. When he takes what&nbsp;is not the path to be the path and what&nbsp;is<br>not fruition to be fruition, the course of his insight is interrupted. He drops his basic<br>meditation subject and sits just enjoying the attachment.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:390;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7220">124.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:390;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft7220">And here illumination, etc., are called imperfections because they are the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:407;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7227">basis for imperfection, not because they are [kammically] unprofitable. But<br>attachment is both an imperfection and the basis for imperfection.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:447;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7220">As basis only they amount to ten; but with the different ways of taking them</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:464;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7220">they come to thirty.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:486;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7220">125.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:486;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft7220">How? When a man takes it thus, “illumination has arisen in me,” his way</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:503;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7227">of taking is due to [false] view.&nbsp;When he takes it thus, “How&nbsp;agreeable this<br>illumination that has arisen is,” his way of taking is due to pride (conceit). When<br>he relishes the illumination, his way of taking is due to craving. So there are<br>three ways of taking it in the case of illumination, that is to say,&nbsp;due to [false]<br>view,&nbsp;to pride (conceit), and to craving. Likewise with the rest. So they come to<br>thirty with the three ways of taking them. Owing to their influence an unskilful,<br>unwary meditator wavers and gets distracted about illumination, etc., and he<br>sees each one of them-illumination and the rest-as “This is mine, this is I, this is<br>my self” (M I 135). Hence the Ancients said:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:664;left:171"><nobr><span class="ft7227">He wavers about illumination,<br>And knowledge, rapturous happiness,<br>About the tranquilness, the bliss,<br>Whereby his mind becomes confused;<br>He wavers about resolution,<br>Exertion, and assurance, too,<br>The adverting-equanimity,<br>And equanimity and attachment (Paṭis II 102).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:824;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7228">37.&nbsp;“‘<i>Equanimity about insight</i>’ is neutrality in the investigation of formations owing to the<br>objective&nbsp;field having been already investigated. But in meaning, when it occurs thus, it is<br>only neutrality. The volition associated with mind-door adverting is called &nbsp;‘<i>equanimity<br></i>(<i>upekkhā</i>)&nbsp;<i>in adverting</i>’ because it occurs in adverting as onlooking (<i>ajjhupekkhana</i>)” (Vism-<br>mhṭ 819).</span></nobr></DIV>

Therefore it is not-self in the sense of no power<br>being exercisable over it; it is impermanent in the sense of non-existence after<br>having come to be; it is painful in the sense of oppression by&nbsp;rise and fall,” all of<br>which should be treated in detail according to the method given under the<br>immaterial septad (§83). And as in the case of illumination, so too with the rest.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:267;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7237">127.&nbsp;Having investigated it thus, he sees the illumination as “This is not mine, this<br>is not I, this is not my self.” [638]<b>&nbsp;</b>He sees knowledge … (etc.) … attachment as “This<br>is not mine, this is not I, this is not my self.” Seeing thus, he does not waver or vacillate<br>about the illumination, and so on.
