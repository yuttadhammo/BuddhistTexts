<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft697">18.&nbsp;<i>Virtue as restraint&nbsp;</i>should be understood here as restraint in five&nbsp;ways: restraint<br>by&nbsp;the rules of the community (<i>pātimokkha</i>)<i>,&nbsp;</i>restraint by&nbsp;mindfulness, restraint<br>by&nbsp;knowledge, restraint by&nbsp;patience, and restraint by&nbsp;energy. Herein, “restraint<br>by&nbsp;the Pātimokkha” is this: “He is furnished, fully furnished, with this<br>Pātimokkha restraint. (Vibh 246)” “Restraint by&nbsp;mindfulness” is this: “He guards<br>the eye faculty, enters upon restraint of the eye faculty” (D I 70). “Restraint by<br>knowledge” is this:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:214;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft690">“The currents in the world that flow,&nbsp;Ajita,”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:200"><nobr><span class="ft690">said the Blessed One,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft697">“Are stemmed by&nbsp;means of mindfulness;<br>Restraint of currents I proclaim,<br>By understanding they are dammed” (Sn 1035);</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:306;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft697">and use of requisites is here combined with this. But what&nbsp;is called “restraint by<br>patience” is that given in the way beginning, “He is one who bears cold and heat”<br>(M I 10). And what&nbsp;is called “restraint by&nbsp;energy” is that given in the way beginning,<br>“He does not endure a thought of sense desires when it arises” (M I 11); purification<br>of livelihood is here combined with this. So this fivefold restraint, and the abstinence,<br>in clansmen who dread evil, from any chance of transgression met with, should<br>all be understood to be “virtue as restraint.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:432;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft692"><i>Virtue as non-transgression&nbsp;</i>is the non-transgression, by&nbsp;body or speech, of precepts</span></nobr></DIV>

It is either a coordinating (<i>samādhāna</i>)<i>,&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>meaning non-<br>inconsistency of bodily action, etc., due to virtuousness; or it is an upholding<br>(<i>upadhāraṇa</i>),8&nbsp;meaning a state of basis (<i>ādhāra</i>)<i>&nbsp;</i>owing to its serving as foundation<br>for profitable states. For those who understand etymology admit only these two<br>meanings. Others, however,&nbsp;comment on the meaning here in the way beginning,<br>“The meaning of virtue (<i>sīla</i>)<i>&nbsp;</i>is the meaning of head (<i>sira</i>)<i>,&nbsp;</i>the meaning of virtue is<br>the meaning of cool (<i>sītala</i>).”</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:167;left:171"><nobr><span class="ft704">Its function has a double sense:<br><i>Action</i>&nbsp;to stop misconduct, then<br><i>Achievement</i>&nbsp;as the quality<br>Of blamelessness in virtuous men.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:241;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft700">So what&nbsp;is called virtue should be understood to have&nbsp;the function (nature) of</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:258;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft704">stopping misconduct as its function (nature) in the sense of action, and a blameless<br>function (nature) as its function (nature) in the sense of achievement.

Also it is said further: “Householder, there are these five&nbsp;benefits<br>for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. What five? Here, householder, one who<br>is virtuous, possessed of virtue, obtains a large fortune as a consequence of diligence;<br>this is the first benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, of one<br>who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, a fair name is spread abroad; this is the second<br>benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, whenever one who is<br>virtuous, possessed of virtue, enters an assembly, whether of khattiyas (warrior-<br>nobles) or brahmans or householders or ascetics, he does so without fear or<br>hesitation; this is the third benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again,<br>one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, dies unconfused; this is the fourth benefit<br>for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, one who is virtuous, possessed<br>of virtue, on the breakup of the body, after death, reappears in a happy destiny, in<br>the heavenly world; this is the fifth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of<br>virtue” (D II 86).

It is the initial stage of the path because it has actually<br>to be purified in the prior stage too. Hence it is said: “But his bodily action, his<br>verbal action, and his livelihood have&nbsp;already been purified earlier” (M III 289). Or<br>the training precepts called “lesser and minor” (D II 154) [12] are&nbsp;<i>that of good<br>behaviour</i>;<i>&nbsp;</i>the rest are&nbsp;<i>that of the beginning of the life of purity</i>.<i>&nbsp;</i>Or what&nbsp;is included in<br>the Double Code (the bhikkhus’ and bhikkhunīs’ Pātimokkha) is&nbsp;<i>that of the beginning<br>of the life of purity</i>;<i>&nbsp;</i>and that included in the duties set out in the Khandhakas [of<br>Vinaya] is&nbsp;<i>that of good behaviour</i>.<i>&nbsp;</i>Through its perfection&nbsp;<i>that of the beginning of the life<br>of purity&nbsp;</i>comes to be perfected. Hence it is said also “that this bhikkhu shall fulfil<br>the state consisting in the beginning of the life of purity without having fulfilled<br>the state consisting in good behaviour—that is not possible” (A III 14–15).

That virtue<br>does not have&nbsp;gain as its limit” (Paṭis I 44), and the rest should be elaborated in the<br>same way.&nbsp;So it is of two kinds as limited and unlimited.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft743">32.&nbsp;<i>8.&nbsp;</i>In the seventh dyad all virtue subject to cankers is&nbsp;<i>mundane</i>;<i>&nbsp;</i>that not subject<br>to cankers is&nbsp;<i>supramundane</i>.<i>&nbsp;</i>Herein, the&nbsp;<i>mundane&nbsp;</i>brings about improvement in future<br>becoming and is a prerequisite for the escape from becoming, according as it is<br>said: “Discipline is for the purpose of restraint, restraint is for the purpose of non-<br>remorse, non-remorse is for the purpose of gladdening, gladdening is for the<br>purpose of happiness, happiness is for the purpose of tranquillity, tranquillity is<br>for the purpose of bliss,&nbsp;bliss is for the purpose of concentration, concentration is<br>for the purpose of correct knowledge and vision, correct knowledge and vision is<br>for the purpose of dispassion, dispassion is for the purpose of fading away&nbsp;[of<br>greed], fading away&nbsp;is for the purpose of deliverance, deliverance is for the purpose<br>of knowledge and vision of deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliverance is<br>for the purpose of complete extinction [of craving, etc.] through not clinging. Talk<br>has that purpose, counsel has that purpose, support has that purpose, giving ear<br>has that purpose, that is to say,&nbsp;the liberation of the mind through not clinging”<br>(Vin V 164).

But the virtue of such pure beings as Mahā Kassapa,<br>etc., and of the Bodhisatta in his various births is virtue&nbsp;<i>due to previous causes</i>. So it<br>is of four kinds as natural virtue, and so on.</span></nobr></DIV>

On these days it is customary&nbsp;&nbsp;for laymen to undertake<br>the Eight Precepts (<i>sīla</i>) or Five&nbsp;Precepts. On the new-moon and full-moon days the<br>Pātimokkha (see note 11) is recited by&nbsp;bhikkhus. The two quarter-moon days are called<br>the “eighth of the half moon.” The Full-moon day is called the “fifteenth” (i.e. fifteen<br>days from the new moon) and is the last day of the lunar month. That of the new moon<br>is called the “fourteenth” when it is the second and fourth new moon of the four-<br>month season (i.e. fourteen days from the full moon), the other two are called the<br>“fifteenth.” This compensates for the irregularities of the lunar period.</span></nobr></DIV>

But where there is no exclusion of light, as in the<br>case of a crystal or a mass of cloud, there it does arise even with respect to what&nbsp;is<br>enclosed by&nbsp;them.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft816">He only apprehends what&nbsp;is really there. Like the Elder Mahā Tissa who dwelt at<br>Cetiyapabbata.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:127;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft816">55.&nbsp;It seems that as the elder was on his way from Cetiyapabbata to Anurādhapura<br>for alms,&nbsp;a certain daughterinlaw of a clan, who had quarrelled with her husband<br>and had set out early from Anurādhapura all dressed up and tricked out like a<br>celestial nymph to go to her relatives’ home, saw him on the road, and being low-<br>minded, [21] she laughed a loud laugh. [Wondering] “What is that?” the elder<br>looked up and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness (ugliness),<br>he reached Arahantship.15&nbsp;Hence it was said:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft816">“He saw the bones that were her teeth,<br>And kept in mind his first perception;<br>And standing on that very spot<br>The elder became an Arahant.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:328;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft810">But her husband, who was going after her, saw the elder and asked, “Venerable</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:345;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft810">sir, did you by&nbsp;any chance see a woman?” The elder told him:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:367;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft816">“Whether it was a man or woman<br>That went by&nbsp;I noticed not,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:440;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft814">“‘<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>sign of beauty</i>’ here is the aspect of woman that is the cause for the arising of</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:456;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft818">lust. By the word ‘etc.’ the sign of resentment (<i>paṭigha</i>), etc., are included, which should<br>be understood as the undesired aspect that is the cause for the arising of hate. And<br>here admittedly only covetousness and grief are specified in the text but the sign of<br>equanimity needs to be included too; since there is non-restraint in the delusion that<br>arises due to overlooking, or since ‘forgetfulness of unknowing’ is said below (§57).<br>And here the ‘sign of equanimity’ should be understood as an object that is the basis<br>for the kind of equanimity associated with unknowing through overlooking it. So ‘<i>the<br>sign of beauty</i>, etc.’ given in brief thus is actually the cause of greed, hate, and delusion.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:586;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft814">“‘<i>He stops at&nbsp;what&nbsp;is merely seen</i>’: according to the Sutta method, ‘The seen shall be</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:602;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft817">merely seen’ (Ud 8). As soon as the colour basis has been apprehended by&nbsp;the<br>consciousnesses of the cognitive&nbsp;series with eye-consciousness he stops; he does not<br>fancy any aspect of beauty, etc., beyond that…. In one who fancies as beautiful, etc., the<br>limbs of the opposite sex, defilements arisen with respect to them successively become<br>particularized, which is why they are called ‘particulars.’&nbsp;But these are simply modes<br>of interpreting (<i>sannivesākāra</i>) the kinds of materiality derived from the (four) primaries<br>that are interpreted (<i>sanniviṭṭha</i>) in such and such wise; for apart from that there is in<br>the ultimate sense no such thing as a hand and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 40–41). See also Ch.<br>III, note 31.<br>15.&nbsp;“As the elder was going along (occupied) only in keeping his meditation subject<br>in mind, since noise is a thorn to those in the early stage, he looked up with the noise of<br>the laughter, (wondering) ‘What is that?’ ‘Perception of foulness’ is perception of bones;<br>for the elder was then making bones his meditation subject. The elder, it seems as soon<br>as he saw her teeth-bones while she was laughing, got the counterpart sign with access<br>jhāna because he had developed&nbsp;the preliminary-work well. While he stood there he<br>reached the first jhāna. Then he made that the basis for insight, which he augmented<br>until he attained the&nbsp;paths one after the other and reached destruction of cankers”<br>(Vism-mhṭ 41–42).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:127;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft827">56.&nbsp;As to the words&nbsp;<i>through which</i>, etc., the meaning is: by&nbsp;reason of which, because<br>of which non-restraint of the eye faculty,&nbsp;<i>if he</i>, if that person,&nbsp;<i>left the eye faculty<br>unguarded</i>, remained with the eye door unclosed by&nbsp;the door-panel of mindfulness,<br>these&nbsp;<i>states of covetousness</i>, etc.,&nbsp;<i>might invade</i>, might pursue, might threaten,&nbsp;<i>him.

It is the same one of whom it is said&nbsp;<i>he guards the<br>eye faculty, undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty</i>.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft826">57.&nbsp;Herein, there is neither restraint nor non-restraint in the actual eye faculty,<br>since neither mindfulness nor forgetfulness arises in dependence on eye-sensitivity.<br>On the contrary when a visible datum as object comes into the eye’s focus, then,<br>after the life-continuum has arisen twice and ceased, the functional mind-element<br>accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceases. After that, eye-<br>consciousness with the function of seeing; after that, resultant mind-element with<br>the function of receiving; after that, resultant root-causeless mind-consciousness-<br>element with the function of investigating; after that, functional root-causeless<br>mind-consciousness-element accomplishing the function of determining arises and<br>ceases. Next to that, impulsion impels.16&nbsp;Herein, there is neither restraint nor non-<br>restraint on the occasion of the life-continuum, or on any of the occasions beginning<br>with adverting. But there is non-restraint if unvirtuousness or forgetfulness or<br>unknowing or impatience or idleness arises at&nbsp;the moment of impulsion. When<br>this happens, it is called “non-restraint in the eye faculty.” [22]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:502;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft826">58.&nbsp;Why is that? Because when this happens, the door is not guarded, nor are the<br>life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the cognitive&nbsp;series. Like what? Just as, when<br>a city’s four gates are not secured, although inside the city house doors, storehouses,<br>rooms, etc., are secured, yet all property inside the city is unguarded and unprotected<br>since robbers coming in by&nbsp;the city gates can do as they please, so too, when<br>unvirtuousness, etc., arise in impulsion in which there is no restraint, then the door too<br>is unguarded, and so also are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of the<br>cognitive&nbsp;series beginning with adverting. But when virtue, etc., has arisen in it, then<br>the door too is guarded and so also are the life-continuum and the consciousnesses of</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:685;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft828">16.&nbsp;To expect to find in the&nbsp;<i>Paramatthamañjūsā</i>&nbsp;an exposition of the “cognitive&nbsp;series”<br>(<i>citta-vīthi</i>), and some explanation of the individual members in addition to what&nbsp;is&nbsp;to<br>be found in the&nbsp;<i>Visuddhimagga</i>&nbsp;itself, is to be disappointed. There are only fragmentary<br>treatments. All that is said here is this:</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:750;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft824">“There is no unvirtuousness, in other words, bodily or verbal misconduct, in the</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:766;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft828">five&nbsp;doors; consequently restraint of unvirtuousness happens through the mind door,<br>and the remaining restraint happens through the six doors. For the arising of<br>forgetfulness and the other three would be in the five&nbsp;doors since they are unprofitable<br>states opposed to mindfulness, etc.; and there is no arising of unvirtuousness consisting<br>in bodily and verbal transgression there because five-door impulsions do not give&nbsp;rise<br>to intimation. And the five&nbsp;kinds of non-restraint beginning with unvirtuousness are<br>stated here as the opposite of the five&nbsp;kinds of restraint beginning with restraint as<br>virtue” (Vism-mhṭ 42).

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:310;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft846">66.&nbsp;The meaning of this text should be understood as follows: Firstly, as regards<br>description of&nbsp;<i>scheming</i>:&nbsp;<i>on the part of one bent on gain, honour and renown&nbsp;</i>is on the<br>part of one who is bent on gain, on honour, and on reputation; on the part of one<br>who longs for them, is the meaning.

And after this the passage beginning&nbsp;<i>or by what&nbsp;is called rejection<br>of requisites&nbsp;</i>is given in order to show the three instances of scheming given in the<br>Mahāniddesa as rejection of requisites, indirect talk, and that based on deportment.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:454;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft846">67.&nbsp;Herein, [a bhikkhu] is invited to accept robes, etc., and, precisely because he<br>wants them, he refuses them out of evil wishes. And then, since he knows that<br>those householders believe&nbsp;in him implicitly when they think, “Oh, how few are<br>our lord’s wishes! He will not accept a thing!” and they put fine robes,&nbsp;etc., before<br>him by&nbsp;various means, he then accepts, making a show that he wants to be<br>compassionate towards them—it is this hypocrisy of his, which becomes the cause<br>of their subsequently bringing them even by&nbsp;cartloads, that should be understood<br>as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:598;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft846">68.&nbsp;For this is said in the Mahāniddesa: “What is the instance of scheming called<br>rejection of requisites? Here householders invite bhikkhus [to accept] robes, alms<br>food, resting place, and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. One who is of<br>evil wishes, a prey to wishes, wanting robes … alms food … resting place … the<br>requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, refuses robes … alms food … resting<br>place … the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, because he wants more.

It is proper for an ascetic to cure himself with putrid urine21<br>and broken gallnuts.’ Accordingly he wears a coarse robe, eats coarse alms food,<br>[25] uses a coarse resting place, uses a coarse requisite of medicine as cure for the<br>sick. Then householders think, ‘This ascetic has few wishes, is content, is secluded,<br>keeps aloof from company, is strenuous, is a preacher of asceticism,’ and they&nbsp;invite<br>him more and more [to accept] robes, alms food, resting places, and the requisite<br>of medicine as cure for the sick. He says: ‘With three things present a faithful<br>clansman produces much merit: with faith present a faithful clansman produces<br>much merit, with goods to be given present a faithful clansman produces much<br>merit, with those worthy to receive&nbsp;present a faithful clansman produces much<br>merit. You have&nbsp;faith; the goods to be given are here; and I am here to accept. If I<br>do not accept, then you will be deprived of the merit. That is no good to me. Rather<br>will I accept out of compassion for you.” Accordingly he accepts many robes,&nbsp;he<br>accepts much alms food, he accepts many resting places, he accepts many requisites<br>of medicine as cure for the sick.

It is the effort consisting in the search for requisites. “Purification” is<br>purifiedness. “Livelihood purification” is purification of livelihood.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:214;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft896">85.&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;As regards the next kind called&nbsp;<i>virtue concerning requisites</i>, [here is the<br>text: “Reflecting wisely, he uses the robe only for protection from cold, for protection<br>from heat, for protection from contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning and<br>creeping things, and only for the purpose of concealing the private parts. Reflecting<br>wisely, he uses alms food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for<br>smartening nor for embellishment, but only for the endurance and continuance of<br>this body, for the ending of discomfort, and for assisting the life of purity: ‘Thus I<br>shall put a stop to old feelings and shall not arouse new feelings, and I shall be<br>healthy and blameless and live&nbsp;in comfort.’ Reflecting wisely, he uses the resting<br>place only for the purpose of protection from cold, for protection from heat, for<br>protection from contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning and creeping things,<br>and only for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and enjoying retreat.<br>Reflecting wisely, he uses the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick only for<br>protection from arisen hurtful feelings and for complete immunity from affliction”<br>(M I 10). Herein,&nbsp;<i>reflecting wisely</i>&nbsp;is reflecting as the means and as the way;27&nbsp;by<br>knowing, by&nbsp;reviewing, is the meaning.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:293;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft923">itself in the sense of imperilling (<i>parisahana</i>) is “perils of climate” (<i>utu-parissaya</i>).<br>Unsuitable climatic conditions that cause mental distraction due to bodily affliction<br>can be warded off by&nbsp;making use of the resting place; it is for the purpose of warding<br>off these and for the purpose of the pleasure of solitude, is what&nbsp;is meant. Of<br>course, the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by&nbsp;[the phrase] “protection<br>from cold,” etc., too; but, just as in the case of making use of the robes the<br>concealment of the private parts is stated as an invariable purpose while the others<br>are periodical [purposes], so here also this [last] should be understood as mentioned<br>with reference to the invariable warding off of the perils of climate. Or alternatively,<br>this “climate” of the kind stated is just climate; but “perils” are of two kinds: evident<br>perils and concealed perils (see Nidd I 12). Herein, evident perils are lions, tigers,<br>etc., while concealed perils are greed, hate, and so on. When a bhikkhu knows and<br>reflects thus in making use of the kind of resting place where these [perils] do not,<br>owing to unguarded doors and sight of unsuitable visible objects, etc., cause<br>affliction, he can be understood as one who “reflecting wisely makes use of the<br>resting place for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:576;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft923">96.&nbsp;<i>The requisite of medicine as cure for the sick</i>: here “cure” (<i>paccaya =&nbsp;</i>going against)<br>is in the sense of going against (<i>pati-ayana</i>) illness; in the sense of countering, is the<br>meaning. This is a term for any suitable remedy. It is the medical man’s work<br>(<i>bhisakkassa kammaṃ</i>) because it is permitted by&nbsp;him, thus it is medicine (<i>bhesajja</i>).<br>Or the cure for the sick itself as medicine is “medicine as cure for the sick.” Any<br>work&nbsp;of a medical man such as oil, honey,&nbsp;ghee, etc., that is suitable for one who is<br>sick, is what&nbsp;is meant. A “requisite” (<i>parikkhāra</i>), however,&nbsp;in such passages as “It is<br>well supplied with the requisites of a city” (A IV 106) is equipment; in such passages<br>as “The chariot has the requisite of virtue, the axle of jhāna, the wheel of energy”<br>(S V 6) [35] it is an ornament; in such passages as “The requisites for the life of one<br>who has gone into homelessness that should be available” (M I 104), it is an<br>accessory. But here both equipment and accessory are applicable. For that medicine<br>as a cure for the sick is equipment for maintaining life because it protects by<br>preventing the arising of affliction destructive&nbsp;to life; and it is an accessory too<br>because it is an instrument for prolonging life.&nbsp;That is why it is called “requisite.”<br>So it is medicine as cure for the sick and that is a requisite, thus it is a “requisite of<br>medicine as cure for the sick.” [He makes use of] that requisite of medicine as cure</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:53;left:461"><nobr><span class="ft932"><i>Description of Virtue</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft933">for the sick; any requisite for life consisting of oil, honey,&nbsp;molasses, ghee, etc., that<br>is allowed by&nbsp;a medical man as suitable for the sick, is what&nbsp;is meant.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:127;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft933">97.&nbsp;<i>From arisen</i>: from born, become, produced.&nbsp;<i>Hurtful</i>:<i>&nbsp;</i>here “hurt (affliction)” is<br>a disturbance of elements, and it is the leprosy, tumours, boils, etc., originated by<br>that disturbance.&nbsp;<i>Hurtful&nbsp;</i>(<i>veyyābādhika</i>) because arisen in the form of hurt (<i>byābādha</i>).<br><i>Feelings</i>: painful feelings, feelings resulting from unprofitable kamma—from those<br>hurtful feelings.&nbsp;<i>For complete immunity from affliction</i>: for complete freedom from<br>pain; so that all that is painful is abandoned, is the meaning.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:236;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft930">This is how this&nbsp;<i>virtue concerning requisites&nbsp;</i>should be understood. In brief its</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:254;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft933">characteristic is the use of requisites after wise reflection. The word-meaning here<br>is this: because breathing things go (<i>ayanti</i>), move, proceed, using [what they use]<br>in dependence on these robes, etc., these robes, etc., are therefore called requisites<br>(<i>paccaya =&nbsp;</i>ger. of&nbsp;<i>paṭi + ayati</i>);<i>&nbsp;</i>“concerning requisites” is concerning those requisites.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:328;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft933">98.&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;So, in this fourfold virtue,&nbsp;<i>Pātimokkha restraint&nbsp;</i>has to be undertaken by<br>means of faith. For that is accomplished by&nbsp;faith, since the announcing of training<br>precepts is outside the disciples’ province; and the evidence here is the refusal of<br>the request to [allow disciples to] announce training precepts (see Vin III 9–10).<br>Having therefore undertaken through faith the training precepts without exception<br>as announced, one should completely perfect them without regard for life.&nbsp;For<br>this is said: [36]</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:454;left:180"><nobr><span class="ft933">“As a hen guards her eggs,<br>Or as a yak her tail,<br>Or like a darling child,<br>Or like an only eye—<br>So you who are engaged<br>Your virtue to protect,<br>Be prudent at&nbsp;all times<br>And ever scrupulous.” (<i>Source untraced</i>)</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:598;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft930">Also it is said further: “So too,&nbsp;sire, when a training precept for disciples is</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:615;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft933">announced by&nbsp;me, my disciples do not transgress it even for the sake of life” (A IV<br>201).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:654;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft933">99.&nbsp;And the story of the elders bound by&nbsp;robbers in the forest should be understood<br>in this sense.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:694;left:90"><nobr><span class="ft930">It seems that robbers in the Mahāvaṭṭanī Forest bound an elder with black</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:711;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft933">creepers and made him lie down. While he lay there for seven days he augmented<br>his insight, and after reaching the fruition of non-return, he died there and was<br>reborn in the Brahmā-world. Also they bound another elder in Tambapaṇṇi Island<br>(Sri Lanka) with string creepers and made him lie down. When a forest fire came<br>and the creepers were not cut, he established insight and attained Nibbāna<br>simultaneously with his death. When the Elder Abhaya, a preacher of the Dīgha<br>Nikāya, passed by&nbsp;with five&nbsp;hundred bhikkhus, he saw [what had happened] and he<br>had the elder’s body cremated and a shrine built. Therefore let other clansmen also:</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft996">so&nbsp;<i>virtue dependent on requisites&nbsp;</i>is to be undertaken by&nbsp;means of&nbsp;<i>understanding</i>. For<br>that is accomplished by&nbsp;understanding, because one who possesses understanding<br>is able to see the advantages and the dangers in requisites. So one should abandon<br>greed for requisites and undertake that virtue by&nbsp;using requisites obtained lawfully<br>and properly, after reviewing them with understanding in the way aforesaid.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:271;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft990">124.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:271;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft990">Herein, reviewing is of two kinds: at&nbsp;the time of receiving requisites and at</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:288;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft996">the time of using them. For use (<i>paribhoga</i>) is blameless in one who at&nbsp;the time of<br>receiving robes, etc., reviews them either as [mere] elements or as repulsive,33&nbsp;and<br>puts them aside for later use, and in one who reviews them thus at&nbsp;the time of<br>using them.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:363;left:112"><nobr><span class="ft990">Here is an explanation to settle the matter. There are four kinds of use: use</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:380;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft996">as theft,34&nbsp;use as a debt?, use as an inheritance, use as a master. Herein, use by&nbsp;one<br>who is unvirtuous and makes use [of requisites], even sitting in the midst of the<br>Community, is called “use as theft.” Use without reviewing by&nbsp;one who is virtuous<br>is “use as a debt”; therefore the robe should be reviewed every time it is used, and<br>the alms food lump by&nbsp;lump. One who cannot do this [should review it] before the<br>meal, after the meal, in the first watch, in the middle watch, and in the last watch.<br>If dawn breaks on him without his having reviewed it, he finds himself in the<br>position of one who has used it as a debt. Also the resting place should be reviewed<br>each time it is used. Recourse to mindfulness both in the accepting and the use of<br>medicine is proper; but while this is so, though there is an offence for one who uses<br>it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance, there is no offence for one who is<br>mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft1080">Virtues not broken for the purpose of gain, etc., and rectified by&nbsp;making</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:105;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1083">amends after being broken by&nbsp;the faults of negligence, etc., and not damaged by<br>the bonds of sexuality and by&nbsp;such evil things as anger and enmity, are called<br>entirely untorn, unrent, unblotched, and unmottled. And those same virtues are<br><i>liberating&nbsp;</i>since they bring about the state of a freeman, and praised by&nbsp;the wise<br>since it is by&nbsp;the wise that they are praised, and&nbsp;<i>unadhered</i>-<i>to&nbsp;</i>since they are not<br>adhered to by&nbsp;means of craving and views, and&nbsp;<i>conducive to concentration&nbsp;</i>since<br>they conduce to access concentration or to absorption concentration. That is why<br>their untornness, etc., should be understood as “cleansing” (see also VII.101f.).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:249;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1083">153.&nbsp;This cleansing comes about in two ways: through seeing the danger of failure<br>in virtue, and through seeing the benefit of perfected virtue. [54] Herein, the danger<br>of failure in virtue can be seen in accordance with such suttas as that beginning,<br>“Bhikkhus, there are these five&nbsp;dangers for the unvirtuous in the failure of virtue”<br>(A III 252).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:341;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1080">154.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:341;left:103"><nobr><span class="ft1080">Furthermore, on account of his unvirtuousness an unvirtuous person is</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:358;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1083">displeasing to deities and human beings, is uninstructable by&nbsp;his fellows in the life<br>of purity, suffers when unvirtuousness is censured, and is remorseful when the<br>virtuous are praised. Owing to that unvirtuousness he is as ugly as hemp cloth.<br>Contact with him is painful because those who fall in with his views are brought<br>to long-lasting suffering in the states of loss. He is worthless because he causes no<br>great fruit [to accrue] to those who give&nbsp;him gifts. He is as hard to purify as a<br>cesspit many years old. He is like a log from a pyre (see It 99); for he is outside<br>both [recluseship and the lay state]. Though claiming the bhikkhu state he is no<br>bhikkhu, so he is like a donkey&nbsp;following a herd of cattle. He is always nervous,<br>like a man who is everyone’s enemy. He is as unfit to live&nbsp;with as a dead carcase.<br>Though he may have&nbsp;the qualities of learning, etc., he is as unfit for the homage of<br>his fellows in the life of purity as a charnel-ground fire is for that of brahmans.&nbsp;He<br>is as incapable of reaching the distinction of attainment as a blind man is of seeing<br>a visible object. He is as careless of the Good Law as a guttersnipe is of a kingdom.<br>Though he fancies he is happy,&nbsp;yet he suffers because he reaps suffering as told in<br>the Discourse on the Mass of Fire (A IV 128–34).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:641;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft1083">155.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;the Blessed One has shown that when the unvirtuous have&nbsp;their minds<br>captured by&nbsp;pleasure and satisfaction in the indulgence of the five&nbsp;cords of sense<br>desires, in [receiving] salutation, in being honoured, etc., the result of that kamma,<br>directly visible in all ways, is very violent pain, with that [kamma] as its condition,<br>capable of producing a gush of hot blood by&nbsp;causing agony of heart with the mere<br>recollection of it.
