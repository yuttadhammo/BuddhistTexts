Therefore the bhikkhu<br>who possesses that [contemplation] gives up defilements and enters into<br>Nibbāna in the way stated, he does not grasp (cling to) defilements by&nbsp;causing<br>rebirth, nor does he grasp (cling to) a formed object through failing to see its<br>unsatisfactoriness.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:633;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7296">20.&nbsp;As to the stanzas:&nbsp;<i>the substitution of the object</i>&nbsp;[means that] after seeing the<br>dissolution of materiality, there is the substitution of another object for that first<br>object by seeing the dissolution of the consciousness by which the dissolution [of<br>materiality] was seen.&nbsp;<i>Transference of understanding</i>&nbsp;is the abandoning of rise and the<br>specializing in fall.&nbsp;<i>The power of adverting</i>&nbsp;is the ability, after seeing the dissolution of<br>materiality, to advert immediately for the purpose of seeing the dissolution of the<br>consciousness that had that dissolution as its object.&nbsp;<i>Are insight following reflection</i>:<br>this is called contemplation of dissolution after reflecting on an object.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7323">seeing the cessation of those present is like her seeing the middle one’s head<br>being cut off. His seeing the cessation of those in the future, thinking, “Formations<br>to be generated in the future will cease too,” is like her giving up hope for the<br>youngest son, thinking, “He too will fare like them.” When he sees in this way,<br>knowledge of appearance as terror arises in him at&nbsp;that stage.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:180;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7323">31.&nbsp;Also another simile: a woman with an infected womb had, it seems, given<br>birth to ten children. [646] Of these, nine had already died and one was dying in<br>her hands. There was another in her womb. Seeing that nine were dead and the<br>tenth was dying, she gave&nbsp;up hope about the one in her womb, thinking, “It too<br>will fare just like them.” Herein, the meditator’s seeing the cessation of past<br>formations is like the woman’s remembering the death of the nine children. The<br>meditator’s seeing the cessation of those present is like her seeing the moribund<br>state of the one in her hands. His seeing the cessation of those in the future is like<br>her giving up hope about the one in her womb. When he sees in this way,<br>knowledge of appearance as terror arises in him at&nbsp;that stage.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:358;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7323">32.&nbsp;But does the knowledge of appearance as terror [itself] fear or does it not<br>fear? It does not fear. For it is simply the mere judgment that past formations have<br>ceased, present ones are ceasing, and future ones will cease. Just as a man with<br>eyes looking at&nbsp;three charcoal pits at&nbsp;a city gate is not himself afraid, since he<br>only forms the mere judgment that all who fall into them will suffer no little<br>pain;—or just as when a man with eyes looks at&nbsp;three spikes set in a row,&nbsp;an<br>acacia spike,&nbsp;an iron spike,&nbsp;and a gold spike,&nbsp;he is not himself afraid, since he<br>only forms the mere judgment that all who fall on these spikes will suffer no<br>little pain;—so too the knowledge of appearance as terror does not itself fear; it<br>only forms the mere judgment that in the three kinds of becoming, which resemble<br>the three charcoal pits and the three spikes, past formations have&nbsp;ceased, present<br>ones are ceasing, and future ones will cease.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:571;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7323">33.&nbsp;But it is called “appearance as terror” only because formations in all kinds<br>of becoming, generation, destiny, station, or abode are fearful in being bound for<br>destruction and so they appear only as a terror.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:628;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7320">Here is the text about its appearance to him as terror: “When he brings to</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:645;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7323">mind as impermanent, what&nbsp;appears to him as terror? When he brings to mind<br>as painful, what&nbsp;appears to him as terror? When he brings to mind as not-self,<br>what&nbsp;appears to him as terror? When he brings to mind as impermanent, the<br>sign appears to him as terror. When he brings to mind as painful, occurrence<br>appears to him as terror. When he brings to mind as not-self, the sign and<br>occurrence appear to him as terror” (Paṭis II 63).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:754;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7320">34.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:754;left:95"><nobr><span class="ft7320">Herein,&nbsp;<i>the sign&nbsp;</i>is the sign of formations. This is a term for past, future and</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:772;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7323">present formations themselves. [647] He sees only the death of formations when<br>he brings them to mind as impermanent and so the sign appears to him as a<br>terror.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Occurrence</i>&nbsp;is occurrence in material and immaterial becoming. He sees<br>occurrence—though ordinarily reckoned as pleasure—only as a state of being<br>continuously oppressed when he brings them to mind as painful, and so<br>occurrence appears to him as a terror.</span></nobr></DIV>

Cf. also the description of the elephant called “Uposatha,” one of the<br>seven treasures of the Wheel-turning Monarch (M II 173).

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:184;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7383">49.&nbsp;But why does he discern them in this way? In order to contrive&nbsp;the means<br>to deliverance. Here is a simile: a man thought to catch a fish, it seems, so he took<br>a fishing net and cast it in the water. He put his hand into the mouth of the net<br>under the water and seized a snake by&nbsp;the neck. He was glad, thinking, “I have<br>caught a fish.” In the belief that he had caught a big fish, he lifted it up to see.<br>When he saw three marks, he perceived that it was a snake and he was terrified.<br>He saw danger, felt dispassion (revulsion) for what&nbsp;he had seized, and desired<br>to be delivered from it. Contriving a means to deliverance, he unwrapped [the<br>coils from] his hand, starting from the tip of its tail. Then he raised his arm, and<br>when he had weakened the snake by&nbsp;swinging it two or three times round his<br>head, he flung it away, crying “Go, foul snake.” Then quickly scrambling up on<br>to dry land, he stood looking back whence he had come, thinking, “Goodness, I<br>have&nbsp;been delivered from the jaws of a huge snake!”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:415;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7383">50.&nbsp;Herein, the time when the meditator was glad at&nbsp;the outset to have&nbsp;acquired<br>a person is like the time when the man was glad to have&nbsp;seized the snake by&nbsp;the<br>neck. This meditator’s seeing the three characteristics in formations after effecting<br>resolution of the compact [into elements] is like the man’s seeing the three marks<br>on pulling the snake’s head out of the mouth of the net. [653] The meditator’s<br>knowledge of appearance as terror is like the time when the man was frightened.<br>Knowledge of contemplation of danger is like the man’s thereupon seeing the<br>danger. Knowledge of contemplation of dispassion is like the man’s dispassion<br>(revulsion) for what&nbsp;he had seized. Knowledge of desire for deliverance is like<br>the man’s deliverance from the snake.&nbsp;The attribution of the three characteristics<br>to formations by&nbsp;knowledge of contemplation of reflection is like the man’s<br>contriving a means to deliverance. For just as the man weakened the snake by<br>swinging it, keeping it away&nbsp;and rendering it incapable of biting, and was thus<br>quite delivered, so too this meditator weakens formations by&nbsp;swinging them<br>with the attribution of the three characteristics, rendering them incapable of<br>appearing again in the modes of permanence, pleasure, beauty, and self, and is<br>thus quite delivered. That is why it was said above&nbsp;that he discerns them in this<br>way “in order to contrive&nbsp;the means to deliverance.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:732;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7383">51.&nbsp;At&nbsp;this point knowledge of reflection has arisen in him, with reference to<br>which it is said: “When he brings to mind as impermanent, there arises in him<br>knowledge after reflecting on what? When he brings to mind as painful, … as<br>not-self, there arises in him knowledge after reflecting on what? When he brings<br>to mind as impermanent, there arises in him knowledge after reflecting on the<br>sign. When he brings to mind as painful, there arises in him knowledge after<br>reflecting on occurrence. When he brings to mind as not-self, there arises in him<br>knowledge after reflecting on the sign and occurrence” (Paṭis II 63).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:95"><nobr><span class="ft7440">Herein,&nbsp;<i>as limited and circumscribed</i>&nbsp;[means] both as limited by rise and fall</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:105;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7445">and as circumscribed by&nbsp;them; for contemplation of impermanence limits them<br>thus, “Formations do not exist previous to their rise,” and in seeking their destiny,<br>sees them as circumscribed thus, “They do not go beyond fall, they vanish there.”<br><i>To&nbsp;the stirring up of the mind</i>: by&nbsp;giving consciousness a sense of urgency; for<br>with the contemplation of pain consciousness acquires a sense of urgency with<br>respect to formations. [658]&nbsp;<i>To&nbsp;the seeing</i>&nbsp;…&nbsp;<i>as alien</i>: to contemplating them as not-<br>self thus: “Not I,” “Not mine.”</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:232;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7445">69.&nbsp;So these three clauses should be understood to express the contemplations<br>of impermanence, and so on. Hence in the answer to the next question [asked in<br>the Paṭisambhidā] it is said: “When he brings [them] to mind as impermanent,<br>formations appear as liable to destruction. When he brings them to mind as<br>painful, formations appear as a terror. When he brings them to mind as not-self,<br>formations appear as void” (Paṭis II 48).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:341;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7445">70.&nbsp;What are the liberations to which these contemplations are the gateways?<br>They are these three, namely, the signless, the desireless, and the void. For this is<br>said: “When one who has great resolution brings [formations] to mind as<br>impermanent, he acquires the signless liberation. When one who has great<br>tranquillity brings [them] to mind as painful, he acquires the desireless liberation.<br>When one who has great wisdom brings [them] to mind as not-self, he acquires<br>the void liberation” (Paṭis II 58).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:467;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7445">71.&nbsp;And here the&nbsp;<i>signless liberation</i>&nbsp;should be understood as the noble path that<br>has occurred by&nbsp;making Nibbāna its object through the signless aspect. For that<br>path is signless owing to the signless element having arisen, and it is a liberation<br>owing to deliverance from defilements.34&nbsp;In the same way the path that has<br>occurred by&nbsp;making Nibbāna its object through the desireless aspect is&nbsp;<i>desireless</i>.<br>And the path that has occurred by&nbsp;making Nibbāna its object through the void<br>aspect is void.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:593;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7445">72.&nbsp;But it is said in the Abhidhamma: “On the occasion when he develops the<br>supramundane jhāna that is an outlet and leads to dispersal, having abandoned<br>the field of [false] views with the reaching of the first grade, secluded from sense<br>desires he enters upon and dwells in the first jhāna, which is desireless … is<br>void,” (Dhs §510) thus mentioning only two liberations. This refers to the way in<br>which insight arrives [at the path] and is expressed literally.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:702;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7445">73.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge is expressed as follows:<br>(i) It is expressed firstly as the void liberation by&nbsp;its liberating from misinterpreting<br>[formations]: “Knowledge of contemplation of impermanence is the void liberation<br>since it liberates from interpreting [them] as permanent; knowledge of<br>contemplation of pain is the void liberation since it liberates from interpreting</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:815;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7446">Nibbāna, and the path is called signless because it has that as its object. One who<br>resolves upon the desireless by&nbsp;keeping desire away&nbsp;by&nbsp;means of the contemplation<br>of pain, and one who resolves upon the void by&nbsp;keeping the belief in self away&nbsp;by<br>means of the contemplation of not-self, should both be construed in the same way”<br>(Vism-mhṭ 846).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:53;left:285"><nobr><span class="ft7452"><i>Purification by Knowledge and Vision of the Way</i></span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:88;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7455">[them] as pleasant; knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the void liberation<br>since it liberates from interpreting [them] as self” (Paṭis II 67). (ii) Then it is<br>expressed as the signless liberation by&nbsp;liberating from signs: “Knowledge of<br>contemplation of impermanence is the signless liberation since it liberates from<br>the sign [of formations] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of pain is<br>the signless liberation since it liberates from the sign [of formations] as pleasant;<br>knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the signless liberation since it liberates<br>from the sign [of formations] as self” (Paṭis II 68). [659] (iii) Lastly it is expressed<br>as the desireless liberation by&nbsp;its liberating from desire: “Knowledge of<br>contemplation of impermanence is the desireless liberation since it liberates<br>from desire [for formations] as permanent; knowledge of contemplation of pain<br>is the desireless liberation since it liberates from the desire [for them] as pleasant;<br>knowledge of contemplation of not-self is the desireless liberation since it<br>liberates from the desire [for them] as self” (Paṭis II 68). But although stated in<br>this way,&nbsp;insight knowledge is not literally signless because there is no<br>abandoning of the sign of formations [as formed, here, as distinct from their<br>sign as impermanent and so on]. It is however literally void and desireless. And<br>it is at&nbsp;the moment of the noble path that the liberation is distinguished, and that<br>is done according to insight knowledge’s way of arrival at&nbsp;the path.35&nbsp;That, it</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:441;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7457">35.&nbsp;“Why is signless insight unable to give&nbsp;its own name to the path when it has<br>come to the point of arrival at&nbsp;the path? Of course, signless insight is mentioned in the<br>suttas thus, ‘Develop the signless and get rid of the inherent tendency to conceit’ (Sn<br>342). Nevertheless, though it eliminates the signs of permanence, of lastingness, and<br>of self, it still possesses a sign itself and is occupied with states that possess a sign.<br>Again, the Abhidhamma is the teaching in the ultimate sense, and in the ultimate<br>sense the cause of a signless path is wanting. For the signless liberation is stated in<br>accordance with the contemplation of impermanence, and in that the faith faculty<br>predominates. But the faith faculty is not represented by&nbsp;any one of the factors of the<br>path. And so it cannot give&nbsp;its name to the path since it forms no part of it. In the case<br>of the other two,&nbsp;the desireless liberation is due to the contemplation of pain, and the<br>void liberation is due to the contemplation of not-self. Now the concentration faculty<br>predominates in the desireless liberation and the understanding faculty in the void<br>liberation. So since these are factors of the path as well, they can give&nbsp;their own names<br>to the path; but there is no signless path because the factor is wanting. So some say.<br>But there are others who say that there is a signless path, and that although it does not<br>get its name from the way insight arrives at&nbsp;it, still it gets its name from a special<br>quality of its own and from its object. In their opinion the desireless and void paths<br>should also get their names from special qualities of their own and from their objects<br>too. That is wrong. Why? Because the path gets its names for two reasons, that is,<br>because of its own nature and because of what&nbsp;it opposes—the meaning is, because of<br>its individual essence and because of what&nbsp;it is contrary to. For the desireless path is<br>free from desire due to greed, etc., and the void path is free from greed too, so they<br>both get their names from their individual essence. Similarly, the desireless path is the<br>contrary of desire and the void path is the contrary of misinterpretation as self, so<br>they get their names from what&nbsp;they oppose. On the other hand, the signless path<br>gets its name only from its own nature owing to the non-existence in it of the signs of<br>greed, etc., or of the signs of permanence, etc., but not owing to what&nbsp;it opposes. For it</span></nobr></DIV>

When a man brings [them] to<br>mind as not-self and, having great wisdom, acquires the faculty of&nbsp;understanding,<br>he becomes (5) a Dhamma devotee at&nbsp;the moment of the stream-entry path; (6) in<br>the next six instances he becomes one attained to vision; and (7) in the case of the<br>highest fruition he becomes one liberated by&nbsp;understanding.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:502;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7460">76.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:502;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft7460">(1) This is said: “When he brings [formations] to mind as impermanent,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:520;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7464">the faith faculty is in excess in him. With the faith faculty in excess he acquires<br>the stream-entry path. Hence he is called a ’faith devotee’” (Paṭis II 53). [660]<br>Likewise, (2) “When he brings [formations] to mind as impermanent, the faith<br>faculty is in excess in him. With the faith faculty in excess the fruition of stream-<br>entry is realized. Hence he is called ‘one liberated by&nbsp;faith’” (Paṭis II 53).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:637;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7465">does not oppose the contemplation of impermanence, which has as its object the sign of<br>formations [as formed], but remains in agreement with it. So a signless path is altogether<br>inadmissible by&nbsp;the Abhidhamma method. This is why it is said, ‘This refers to the way in<br>which insight arrives at&nbsp;the path and is expressed in the literal sense’ (§72).</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:701;left:81"><nobr><span class="ft7463">“However,&nbsp;by&nbsp;the Suttanta method a signless path is admissible. For according to that,</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:718;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7465">in whatever way insight leading to emergence (see §83) effects its comprehending it still<br>leads on to emergence of the path, and when it is at&nbsp;the point of arrival it gives its own<br>name to the path accordingly—when emerging owing to comprehension as impermanent<br>the path is signless, when emerging owing to comprehension as painful it is desireless,<br>and when emerging owing to comprehension as not-self it is void. Taking this as a sutta<br>commentary, therefore, three liberations are differentiated here. But in the Paṭisambhidā<br>the deliverance from misinterpreting, from the sign and from desire, are taken respectively<br>as the arrival of the three kinds of comprehension at&nbsp;that deliverance, and what&nbsp;is described<br>is a corresponding state of void liberation, etc., respectively in the paths that follow upon<br>that deliverance. There is no question of treating that literally, which is why he said,<br>‘However,&nbsp;in the Paṭisambhidā insight knowledge’ and so on” (Vism-mhṭ 846–48).</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:515;left:72"><nobr><span class="ft7473">80.&nbsp;“How is it that understanding of desire for deliverance, of reflection, and of<br>composure is knowledge of the kinds of equanimity about formations?<br>Understanding of desire for deliverance, of reflection, and composure [occupied<br>with] arising is knowledge of equanimity about formations.

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:159;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7486">83.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;when this clansman has reached equanimity about formations thus,<br>his insight has reached its culmination and leads to emergence. “Insight that<br>has reached culmination” or “insight leading to emergence” are names for the<br>three kinds of knowledge beginning with equanimity about formations, [that is,<br>equanimity about formations, conformity, and change-of-lineage]. It has “reached<br>its culmination” because it has reached the culminating final stage. It is called<br>“leading to emergence” because it goes towards emergence. The path is called<br>“emergence” because it emerges externally from the objective&nbsp;basis interpreted<br>as a sign and also internally from occurrence [of defilement].36&nbsp;It goes to that,<br>thus it leads to emergence; the meaning is that it joins with the path.</span></nobr></DIV>

<DIV style="position:absolute;top:338;left:96"><nobr><span class="ft7480">Herein, for the purpose of clarification there is this list of the kinds of</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:355;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7486">emergence classed according to the manner of interpreting: (1) after interpreting<br>the internal37&nbsp;it emerges from the internal, (2) after interpreting the internal it<br>emerges from the external, (3) after interpreting the external it emerges from the<br>external, (4) after interpreting the external it emerges from the internal; (5) after<br>interpreting the material it emerges from the material, (6) after interpreting the<br>material it emerges from the immaterial, (7) after interpreting the immaterial it<br>emerges from the immaterial, (8) after interpreting the immaterial it emerges<br>from the material; (9) it emerges at&nbsp;one stroke from the five&nbsp;aggregates; (10) after<br>interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the impermanent, (11) after<br>interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the painful, (12) after interpreting<br>as impermanent it emerges from the not-self; (13) after interpreting as painful it<br>emerges from the painful, (14) after interpreting as painful it emerges from the<br>impermanent, (15) after interpreting as painful it emerges from the not-self, (16)<br>after interpreting as not-self it emerges from the not-self, (17) after interpreting<br>as not-self it emerges from the impermanent, (18) after interpreting as not-self it<br>emerges from the painful. How?</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:653;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7488">36.&nbsp;“‘<i>From the object interpreted as the sign</i>’: from the pentad of aggregates as the<br>object of insight; for that pentad of aggregates is called the ‘object interpreted’ on<br>account of the interpreting, in other words, on account of being made the domain of<br>insight. And although it is included in one’s own continuity, it is nevertheless called<br>‘external’ because it is seen as alien to it; it is that too which in other contexts is spoken<br>of as ‘externally from all signs’ (Paṭis I 71). ‘Internally from occurrence’: from the<br>occurrence of wrong view,&nbsp;etc., in one’s own continuity, and from the defilements and<br>from the aggregates that occur consequent upon them. For it is stated in this way<br>because there is occurrence of defilement in one’s own continuity and because there<br>is occurrence of clung-to aggregates produced by&nbsp;that [defilement] when there is no<br>path development. And emergence consists both in making these the object and in<br>producing their non-liability to future arising” (Vism-mhṭ 853).<br>37.&nbsp;“‘<i>Emerges from the internal</i>’ is said figuratively owing to the fact that in this case<br>the insight leading to emergence has an internal state as its object. In the literal sense,<br>however,&nbsp;the path emerges from both” (Vism-mhṭ 853).</span></nobr></DIV>

After interpreting them he sees them. But emergence of the path does<br>not come about through seeing the bare internal only since the external must be<br>seen too, so he sees that another’s aggregates, as well as unclung-to formations<br>[inanimate things], are impermanent, painful, not-self. At&nbsp;one time [662] he<br>comprehends the internal and at&nbsp;another time the external. As he does so, insight<br>joins with the path while he is comprehending the internal.

When he has<br>done that, he sees the materiality of the primaries and the materiality derived<br>from them all together. But emergence does not come about through the seeing<br>of bare materiality only since the immaterial must be seen too, so he sees as the<br>immaterial [mentality] the feeling, perception, formations and consciousness<br>that have&nbsp;arisen by&nbsp;making that materiality their object. At&nbsp;one time he<br>comprehends the material and at&nbsp;another the immaterial. As he does so, insight<br>joins with the path while he is comprehending materiality. It is said of him that<br>“after interpreting the material it emerges from the material.” (6) But if his insight<br>joins with the path at&nbsp;the time when he is comprehending the immaterial, it is<br>said of him that “after interpreting the material it emerges from the immaterial.”<br>(7) Similarly in the case of “after interpreting the immaterial it emerges from the<br>immaterial,” and (8) “from the material.”</span></nobr></DIV>

It is said of him that<br>“after interpreting as impermanent it emerges from the impermanent,” (11)–<br>(12) But if emergence comes about in him while he is comprehending them as<br>painful … as not-self, then it is said that “after interpreting as impermanent it<br>emerges from the painful … from the not-self.” Similarly in the cases of emergence<br>after interpreting (13)–(15) as painful and (16)–(18) as not-self.</span></nobr></DIV>

But if they are brought in here,<br>then all becomes clear from appearance as terror up to fruition knowledge,<br>which is why it was said that they should be brought in here.38</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:485;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7506">91.&nbsp;<i>1. The Fruit Bat.</i>&nbsp;There was a fruit bat, it seems. She had alighted on a honey<br>tree (<i>madhuka</i>) with five&nbsp;branches, thinking, “I shall find flowers or fruits here.”<br>She investigated one branch but saw no flowers or fruits there worth taking. And<br>as with the first so too she tried the second, the third, the fourth, and the fifth, but<br>saw nothing. She thought, “This tree is barren; there is nothing worth taking<br>here,” so she lost interest in the tree. She climbed up on a straight branch, and<br>poking her head through a gap in the foliage, she looked upwards, flew up into<br>the air and alighted on another tree.</span></nobr></DIV>
<DIV style="position:absolute;top:629;left:63"><nobr><span class="ft7506">92.&nbsp;Herein, the meditator should be regarded as like the fruit bat. The five&nbsp;aggregates<br>as objects of clinging are like the honey tree with the five&nbsp;branches. The meditator’s<br>interpreting of the five&nbsp;aggregates is like the fruit bat’s alighting on the tree. His<br>comprehending the materiality aggregate and, seeing nothing there worth taking,<br>comprehending the remaining aggregates is like her trying each branch and, seeing<br>nothing there worth taking, trying the rest. His triple knowledge beginning with<br>desire for deliverance, after he has become dispassionate towards the five&nbsp;aggregates<br>[664] through seeing their characteristic of impermanence, etc., is like her thinking<br>“This tree is barren; there is nothing worth taking here” and losing interest. His<br>conformity knowledge is like her climbing up the straight branch. His change-of-<br>lineage knowledge is like her poking her head out and looking upwards.&nbsp;His path<br>knowledge is like her flying up into the air.
